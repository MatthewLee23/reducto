                               GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                               Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                               structure combines the specialized expertise of
                               three world-class investment management groups--
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE          Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                               autonomously, relying on its own research and
                               staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                               that underlie its success.

                               FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                               recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                               also brings expertise in growth-and value-style
                               U.S. equity investing.

                               TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                               international investing and, in 1954, launched
                               what has become the industry's oldest global
                               fund. Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                               Templeton offers investors a truly global
                               perspective.

                               MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                               dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                               searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                               it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                               arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION           Because our management groups work independently
                               and adhere to different investment approaches,
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                               typically have distinct portfolios. That's why
                               our funds can be used to build truly diversified
                               allocation plans covering every major asset
                               class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST      At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                               consistently provide investors with exceptional
                               risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                               as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                               that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                               names in financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +8.26% based on market price and +5.86% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of +1.40% in local currency terms
and +2.46% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period. 1 You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, global economies seemed resilient in the face
of moderating U.S. economic conditions. In general, lower energy and commodity
prices curbed inflation despite improved global growth rates and strong labor
markets. Oil prices fell 19% from a high of $77 per barrel in July to about $62
per barrel at period-end, alleviating some of the pressure on oil importing
countries. In the U.S., the trade deficit narrowed to $59 billion by January
2007 from $69 billion in August 2006. However, the magnitude of the adjustment
was small compared with the overall size of the current account deficit, which
was 5.8% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2006, and
continued to be heavily dependent on foreign inflows for financing. 2 Lower oil
prices and an improved labor market also supported consumption growth,
offsetting some of the weakness in the U.S. housing market. For 2006, U.S. GDP
grew 3.3%, which was in line with its historical average. Underlying inflation
pressures in the U.S. remained relatively high and the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board left the federal funds target rate unchanged at 5.25% throughout the
reporting period.

In Japan, structural economic improvement was most evident in the upward
inflation trend, which in 2006, turned positive on a yearly basis for the first
time since 1998. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the second time
since ending its zero interest rate policy last year. Although Japan's GDP
growth rate has been relatively volatile, the economy grew at a
faster-than-average pace of 2.3% in 2006, increasingly supported by a revival in
private consumption. 3 Other Asian economies also remained strong in the fourth
quarter of 2006, with growth in Singapore of 7.9%, Indonesia 6.1% and

Malaysia 5.7%. 4 Increased intra-regional trade remained an important growth
driver, and China continued to be an important source of demand for Asia's
exports of goods and services. While China allowed limited currency
appreciation, it continued to accumulate international reserves that exceeded
$1 trillion in the reporting period, adding $162.9 billion during the last
four months of 2006. 5 The yuan rose 2.7% for the six months under review. 6

Supported by investment growth and external demand from Asia and other parts
of Europe, Euro-zone economic growth notably accelerated, increasing 2.7% in
2006 from 1.5% in 2005. 7 Private consumption trends were more dynamic than in
prior years, but weak real wage growth remained an impediment to stronger
consumer spending. Labor markets improved and the unemployment rate dropped
from 8.8% in early 2005 to 7.5% by the end of 2006. 7 The European Central
Bank tightened its monetary policy, hiking interest rates 50 basis points (100
basis points equal one percentage point) to 3.50%. 7 Among non-euro European
countries, economic growth was even better. In the fourth quarter of 2006, GDP
growth in Slovakia was 9.6%, Poland 6.4%, Sweden 4.9% and Norway 4.5%. 7
Growth among these countries was broad based while inflation remained low,
supported by lower energy prices and improved productivity growth. Despite low
inflation, rapidly narrowing excess capacity led Norway and Sweden to hike
rates 75 basis points each.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

      and New Zealand dollar.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

During the six months under review, the overall duration of the Fund's
portfolio remained relatively short amid a backdrop of strong global growth
rates and inflation and valuation concerns. However, we continued to find
select interest rate opportunities determined by country-specific factors. For
example, Indonesian bond market strength was driven primarily by a 250 basis
point interest rate reduction during the period. The Fund benefited from its
investments in domestic Indonesian bonds, which rose +13.19% in local currency
terms, as measured by the HSBC Asian Local Bond Index (ALBI). 9 In Brazil,
improving inflation and credit fundamentals allowed the central bank to reduce
interest rates 125 basis points and supported local currency returns of
+20.32% in the JPM Global Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM). 10 Brazilian
inflation declined from 8% in mid-2005 to 3% at period-end. 11 Brazilian real
interest rates were high over the period and disinflation allowed the central
bank to lower nominal rates to boost relatively slow aggregate growth.
Consistent with our investment strategy, the Fund can invest across a wide
spectrum of local bond markets and protect against currency risk.

CURRENCY STRATEGY

Global imbalances resulted in strong relative consumption growth and a large
U.S. current account deficit, as well as low domestic demand and current
account surpluses in Asia. Based on our view that these imbalances could
gradually unwind over the medium term, we continued to position the portfolio
for a weak U.S. dollar through a basket of Asian currencies. Over the period,
the yen has taken on a greater role in the Fund's currency exposure and is now
the single largest currency represented among a diversified portfolio despite
an underweighted allocation compared with the Citigroup World Government Bond
Index (WGBI) Index. 12 Japan's relatively low interest rate environment worked
against the yen as it weakened 1.01% against the U.S. dollar during the review
period. 6 However, we continued to find yen valuations attractive and see room
for the difference between Japan's interest rates and those of other major
economies to narrow as the nation's structural

improvements continue to take hold. The Fund also maintained diversified
exposure across several other Asian currencies. Among those other currencies,
the Thai baht rose 10.72% against the U.S. dollar, despite investor uncertainty
over capital controls instituted under the new government that came to power by
a coup in the fall of 2006. 6 Additionally, the Malaysian ringgit appreciated
5.08% against the U.S. dollar and the South Korean won rose 2.10%. 6

European currencies had mixed performance over the period. Although the Fund
had limited direct exposure to the euro, it was positioned to benefit from
euro appreciation through its investments in non-euro European currencies,
which are sensitive to euro movements. This strategy worked well for the Fund
as central European currencies outperformed the euro's 3.20% rise during the
review period. 6 The Slovak koruna appreciated 12.95% as the nation's
prospects improved for joining the European Union (EU) in 2009. 6
Additionally, Romania's successful entrance into the EU at the beginning of
2007 helped boost its currency 7.12%. 6 The Fund benefited from its exposure
to the Polish zloty, which appreciated 4.14%, while Scandinavian currencies
lagged, with the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona rising 3.09% and 2.63%. 6

The U.S. dollar rose 0.34% against its major trading partners, largely due to
5.36% depreciation of the Canadian dollar, which detracted from the Fund's
relative performance. 6 However, we continued to find the Canadian dollar
attractive given its low valuation and Canada's economic strength. For
example, Canada's unemployment rate dropped to a 30-year low of 6.1% in
February 2007, and it is the only major developed nation to run both a fiscal
surplus and a current account surplus. 13

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also invested in investment-grade and sub investment-grade sovereign
debt that as an asset class typically compensates for greater credit risk by
offering higher yields relative to U.S. and European benchmark treasury
curves. Despite rising U.S. interest rates, U.S. dollar-denominated emerging
market debt generated a strong six-month return of +5.88% as measured by the
JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG). 14 Sovereign interest rate
spreads declined from 197 basis points at the beginning of the reporting
period to 187 basis points by period-end. 15 Regionally, Latin American

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These differences may be
permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital
accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no impact
on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic adjustments
in the security's interest rate and principal redemption value, by amounts
corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments, including
adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest income.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At February 28, 2007, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized

August 31, 2006, 66,994 shares were issued for $600,550 from reinvested
distributions.

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through February 28, 2007, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the periods ended August 31,
2006 and February 28, 2007, there were no share repurchases.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily

8. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 19.20% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

9. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

10. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative
fees paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

11. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares ("marketing support"), Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"),
entered into settlements with certain of those regulators and governmental
entities. Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among
others, concerning market timing and marketing support.

On June 23, 2006, the SEC approved the proposed plan of distribution for the
marketing support settlement, and disbursement of the settlement monies to the
designated funds, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that settlement
and plan, was completed in September 2006. The Fund did not participate in that
settlement.

The plan of distribution for the market timing settlement is currently under
review by the SEC staff. After publication of notice of the plan and a 30-day
comment period, the proposed plan of distribution will be submitted to the SEC
for approval. Following the SEC's approval of the plan of distribution, with
modifications as appropriate, distribution of the settlement monies will begin
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement and plan.

11. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS (CONTINUED)

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above, as well as to allegedly excessive commissions and
advisory and distribution fees.

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition,
classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the
related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
date of effectiveness. On December 22, 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission extended the implementation date to no later than the last net asset
value calculation in the first semi-annual reporting period in 2007. The Fund is
currently evaluating the impact, if any, of applying the various provisions of
FIN 48.

In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement"
("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Fund believes the adoption of SFAS 157
will have no material impact on its financial statements.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to Mellon
Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a
maximum of $5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her
account. These payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon
Bank, N.A." and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh,
PA 15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator
shall apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share
of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box
3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share.

DIRECT DEPOSIT SERVICE FOR REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS

Cash distributions can now be electronically credited to a checking or savings
account at any financial institution that participates in the Automated Clearing
House ("ACH") system. The Direct Deposit service is provided for registered

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
will refer the matter, along with the recommended course of action by the
manager to an interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include
portfolio managers and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for
evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the
voting recommendation of ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third
party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with a
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. Where the Proxy Review Committee
refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board of trustees or a committee of the
board.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the ISS quantitative model utilized to assess such plans
and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,

forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed

effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
