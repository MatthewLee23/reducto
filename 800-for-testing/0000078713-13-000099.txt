President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

Pioneer continues to see only modest economic growth in the U.S. Employment
continues to rise, albeit slowly, and we believe it will continue to do so for
the rest of 2013, barring a negative shock to the system. The housing and auto
sectors continue to recover, benefiting from record-low interest rates. Banks'
willingness to lend to consumers and businesses also continues to rise, broad
measures of inflation remain subdued, and, if the weather cooperates in 2013,
food prices should come back down. And, while corporate profit growth has
slowed, profits remain high and many U.S. companies continue to both pay and
increase dividends*. Offsetting some of these positives are the continued
contraction of fiscal policy in Washington and a recessionary Europe.

The Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy has driven Treasury yields to
generational lows and supported investments in all financial assets, including
equities and high-yield corporate bonds. For example, the Standard & Poor's 500
Index (the S&P 500), a broad measure of the U.S. stock market, returned 15.99%
for the full calendar year ended December 31, 2012, and the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index (the High Yield Index), which measures
the performance of high-yield corporate bonds, returned 15.59% for the same
12-month period. On the other hand, the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index (the
Aggregate Index), which tracks the performance of a higher-quality bond
universe, gained 4.22% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012; the
safer-still Barclays Government Credit Index (the Government/Credit Index)
returned 4.82%; and 3-month Treasury bills, generally regarded as essentially
"risk free" by the markets, returned just 0.09% in 2012. "Risky" assets
outperformed again in the first quarter of 2013, as the S&P 500 returned 10.60%
and the High Yield Index returned 2.89%. In contrast, the Aggregate Index
returned -0.12% in the first quarter, the Government Credit Index returned
-0.16%, and Treasury bills returned 0.02%.

Despite generally improving economic conditions and a rising stock market,
global economies and investors still face daunting challenges as 2013 moves
forward, although we remain cautiously optimistic. U.S. fiscal policy remains
unsettled, and we feel the U.S. government could be at risk of credit rating
downgrades from one or more of the major ratings agencies if the uncertainties
persist. The Federal Reserve continues to provide extraordinary support to the
U.S. economy and the bond market, but will not do so indefinitely. Europe has
made progress, but has not yet resolved its sovereign-debt/banking problem, nor
has the region been able to exit recession. Japan recently has unveiled
aggressive and unconventional monetary and fiscal policies, but the country

continues to face issues such as high levels of debt as well as an aging
population. China and other emerging economies, while generally in better shape
than most "developed" markets, also face a range of challenges.

While most of the risks outlined here are widely recognized and may already be
"priced in" to the market, we believe investors should continue to expect market
volatility.

At Pioneer, we have long advocated the benefits of staying diversified and
investing for the long term. And while diversification does not assure a profit
or protect against loss in a declining market, we believe there are still
opportunities for prudent investors to earn attractive returns. Our advice, as
always, is to work closely with a trusted financial advisor to discuss your
goals and work together to develop an investment strategy that meets your
individual needs, keeping in mind that there is no single best strategy that
works for every investor.

Pioneer's investment teams have, since 1928, sought out attractive opportunities
in global equity and bond markets, using in-depth research to identify
undervalued individual securities, and using thoughtful risk management to
construct portfolios which balance potential risks and reward in an
ever-changing world.

We encourage you to learn more about Pioneer and our time-tested approach to
investing by consulting with your financial advisor or visiting us online at
us.pioneerinvestments.com. We greatly appreciate your trust in us, and we thank
you for investing with Pioneer.

Sincerely,

/s/ Daniel K. Kingsbury

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/13

In a persistently low-interest-rate environment, floating-rate bank loans
continued to attract yield-seeking investors, resulting in solid returns from
the bank-loan asset class during the six-month period ended May 31, 2013. In the
following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that affected the
performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the six-month period. Mr.
Sharkey, a vice president and portfolio manager at Pioneer, is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q   How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2013?

A   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 6.01% at net asset value and 6.84% at
    market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2013, while the
    Trust's benchmark, the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
    Index), returned 7.75%. Unlike the Trust, the Barclays Index does not use
    leverage. While use of leverage increases investment opportunity, it also
    increases investment risk. In addition, during the same six-month period,
    the average return (at market price) of the 20 closed-end funds in Lipper's
    Loan Participation Funds category (which may or may not be leveraged) was
    6.91%.

    The shares of the Trust were selling at a 3.9% premium to net asset value on
    May 31, 2013.

    On May 31, 2013, the Trust's standard 30-day SEC yield was 6.09%.

Q   How would you describe the investment environment during the six-month
    period ended May 31, 2013?

A   Throughout the six-month period, investor demand for floating-rate loans
    remained strong. While other credit-sensitive sectors, including
    investment-grade and higher-yielding corporate bonds, also fared well, those
    asset classes did not hold up as well as bank loans in May, the final month
    of the period, when Treasury rates moved up. At that point in the period,
    the floating-rate feature of bank loans helped to protect the loans' prices
    when credit markets started to show concern that interest rates might rise
    and bond prices would subsequently fall.

    Through the first five months of 2013, $21.9 billion in investor assets
    flowed into the floating-rate market, compared with just $1.7 billion during
    the comparable time period in 2012. The increased inflows to the
    floating-rate loan market included a resurgence of new collateralized loan
    obligations (CLOs) - which are pooled investment vehicles that invest in
    loans - issued

    by financial institutions. The growing presence of CLOs in the market added
    to investor demand and contributed to the healthy backdrop for floating-rate
    loans during the six-month period. At the same time, the total supply of
    loans available for investment grew, but not enough to keep up with demand.
    This led to nearly a quarter of the Barclays Index being refinanced during
    the period, which resulted in reduced spreads. In general, lower-quality B
    and CCC-rated loans tended to outperform higher-quality, higher-rated loans
    during the six-month period, as investors were willing to take on credit
    risk in return for additional yield. While the Trust benefited from the
    favorable environment during the period, we maintained our emphasis on
    having the Trust's portfolio hold higher-quality loans.

Q   The Trust performed solidly during the six-month period ended May 31, 2013,
    but slightly underperformed the benchmark Barclays Index. What were the main
    reasons behind the Trust's benchmark-relative underperformance during the
    six-month period?

A   The Trust's benchmark-relative underperformance was due primarily to the
    drop in the values of two large portfolio holdings, Celtic Pharmaceutical
    and Azithromycin, both of which were undergoing restructurings during the
    period. Secondarily, as we have improved the quality of the holdings in the
    Trust's portfolio over the past two years, the Trust's performance has
    benefited less from the "risk-on" rally that has driven CCC-rated and
    low-single B-rated loan returns higher.

Q   Which of your investment strategies or individual investments had the
    greatest effect on the Trust's performance during the six-month period ended
    May 31, 2013?

A   In a healthy environment for floating-rate assets, the Trust's portfolio of
    loan investments delivered solid returns during the six-month period.

    The Trust saw strong performance from holdings across the portfolio, with
    several investments performing particularly well. Among the stronger-
    performing individual investments in the Trust's portfolio during the period
    was a small equity stake in Delphi Automotive, which the Trust acquired as a
    result of the automotive components company's financial restructuring when
    it emerged from bankruptcy protection. When the value of the Delphi stock
    appreciated during the six-month period, the Trust's performance benefited.
    Among the Trust's bank loan investments, a top performance contributor was
    the debt of Medical Card Systems, which is a health care management services
    company operating in Puerto Rico. The debt of global mining company BUMI
    Resources also moved up from distressed prices during the period as the
    company was able to clarify its capital structure. In the energy sector,
    loans to FTS International, a drilling

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/13 5
<PAGE>

    services operator focusing on natural gas development, outperformed after
    the company reported unexpectedly strong operating results for the final
    quarter of 2012. Also supporting the Trust's results were positions in
    tranches, or sections of CLOs, as many CLOs appreciated in value during
    the period in conjunction with the resurgence of new CLO issuance.

    The Trust did own some disappointing investments during the period,
    including a position in loans to Azithromycin, a pharmaceutical company,
    which fell short of its plans for introducing new products. The Trust's
    investments in loans to three other health care companies also held back
    results. The performance of Accent Care, a home-health care services
    company that was affected by a combination of CMS rate cuts and
    slower-than-anticipated assimilation of an acquisition. Meanwhile, loans to
    Virtual Radiologic, which operates medical imaging offices throughout the
    nation, lagged after the company reported disappointing sales following its
    merger with another firm. Celtic, another pharmaceutical company, continued
    to decline in value while going through restructuring. At the same time,
    the Trust's position in loans to IAP Worldwide Services, a defense
    contractor specializing in logistics management, underperformed amid
    worries about how the company could be affected by cutbacks in U.S. defense
    spending.

Q   How did the level of leverage in the Trust change during the six-month
    period ended May 31, 2013?

A   At the end of the six-month period on May 31, 2013, 35.7% of the Trust's
    total managed assets were financed by leverage, compared with 36.1% of the
    Trust's total managed assets financed by leverage at the start of the period
    on December 1, 2012. The decrease was due to an increase in the value of
    securities in which the Trust had invested.

Q   What is your investment outlook?

A   We think the outlook for bank loans remains favorable. Investors continue
    to pour new money into bank loans, which appear increasingly attractive
    relative to other fixed-income asset classes, including corporate bonds,
    given the floating-rate nature of bank loans. As a group, bank loans tend
    to sell at a slight discount to par (face) value, while other fixed-income
    assets have been selling at premiums to par. Moreover, floating-rate bank
    loans still have the built-in advantage of offering investors the potential
    for higher yields during rising interest-rate environments. In the same
    type of environment, many fixed-rate securities become more vulnerable to
    price losses. As we have worked through the "fiscal cliff" concerns in the
    first half of the year, it now appears that the loan market is poised to
    experience an increasing volume of new issuance, which should lead to a
    healthier overall market.

6 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/13
<PAGE>

    We think the overall economic backdrop also looks favorable. We anticipate
    that the U.S. economy is likely to grow at an annual rate of 2% to 2.5% over
    the next year. The recent gains in both the housing and stock markets should
    only help to sustain growth levels as consumers gain more confidence in the
    economy. We believe a slow-to-moderate growth rate for the economy should
    support bank loans as an asset class, as companies should be able to service
    their debts without much difficulty, especially after all the cost-cutting
    measures U.S. corporations have undertaken over the past three-to-four
    years. In addition, default rates for bank loans remain below long-term
    averages, and we do not expect to see any material increase in defaults over
    the next year.

    Even after the solid returns they have posted over the past year, we think
    floating-rate bank loans continue to offer opportunity for income-oriented
    investors, including those who want to help protect the values of their
    portfolios should interest rates begin to rise.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 13-42 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the Trust
believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be
difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares. The
Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt securities,
which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant risks, including
the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be sufficient
to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the return for the
holders of common shares. Since February of 2008, regularly scheduled auctions
for the Trust's preferred shares have failed and preferred shareowners have not
been able to sell their shares at auction. The Board of Trustees of the Trust
continues to consider, this issue. See note 10 to the financial statements
regarding the planned redemption of outstanding preferred shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-
average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default
or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and rating agency asset
coverage requirements in connection with its outstanding preferred shares. In
order to maintain required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to
alter the composition of its investment portfolio or take other actions, such as
redeeming preferred shares with the proceeds from portfolio transactions, at
what might be inopportune times in the market. Such actions could reduce the net
earnings or returns to holders of the Trust's common shares over time.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends or
the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. These statements should not
be relied upon for any other purposes.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold
in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower
than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total liabilities,
which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common shares
outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend
reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

* The Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index measures the performance of
high-yield loans. Since comparisons for the Barclays Index begin in 2006, the
chart assumes an initial investment of $10,913, which is equal to the Trust's
value at 11/30/2006.

** The CS Leveraged Loan Index (the CS Index) is a representative index of
tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The CS Index began in
January 1992. Comparisons to the Trust for the CS Index begin in 2004. The CS
Index was the Trust's benchmark through March 1, 2011, and was at that time
replaced by the Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
Index). Because the historical performance of the Barclays Index dates back only
to 2006, two years after the inception of the Trust in 2004, the Trust will
continue to provide "Market Value of $10,000 Investment" comparisons for both
the CS Index and the Barclays Index.

Returns of both indices are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends
and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
The indices do not employ leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Trust's investments.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels below.

    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
              similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds credit
              risks, etc.) See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
              assumptions in determining fair value of investments) See Notes
              to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Generally, equity securities are categorized as Level 1, fixed income securities
and senior loans are categorized as Level 2, and securities valued using fair
value methods (other than prices supplied by independent pricing services) as
level 3. See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Notes to Financial Statements | 5/31/13 (unaudited)

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified
fund. The investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of
current income. The Trust will, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation
of capital to the extent consistent with its primary objective of high current
income.

The Trusts financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.  Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
    loan interests (senior loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
    established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
    bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
    Loan Pricing Corporation, an independent pricing service. Senior loans for
    which no reliable price quotes are available will be valued by Loan Pricing
    Corporation through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations.
    Fixed-income securities with remaining maturity of more than sixty days are
    valued at prices supplied by independent pricing services, which consider
    such factors as market prices, market events, quotations from one or more
    brokers, Treasury spreads, yields, maturities and ratings. Valuations may be
    supplemented by dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities
    that are traded on an exchange are valued at the last sale price on the
    principal exchange where they are traded. Equity securities that have not
    traded on the date of valuation, or securities for which sale prices are not
    available, generally are valued using the mean between the last bid and
    asked prices.

48 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/13
<PAGE>

    Short-term fixed income securities with remaining maturities of sixty days
    or less generally are valued at amortized cost. Shares of money market
    mutual funds are valued at such funds' net asset value.

    Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various
    times prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The values
    of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's
    shares are determined as of such times.

    Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services are
    unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are not
    readily available or are considered to be unreliable are valued by or at the
    direction or with the approval of the Valuation Committee using fair value
    methods pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. The
    Valuation Committee is comprised of certain members of the Board of
    Trustees. The Trust may use fair value methods if it is determined that a
    significant event has occurred after the close of the exchange or market on
    which the security trades and prior to the determination of the Trusts net
    asset value. Examples of a significant event might include political or
    economic news, corporate restructurings, natural disasters, terrorist
    activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may
    differ from exchange prices and such differences could be material. The
    Trust's investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM) is
    responsible for monitoring developments that may impact fair valued
    securities and for discussing and assessing fair values on an ongoing basis,
    and at least quarterly, with the Valuation Committee.

    At May 31, 2013, 10 securities were valued using fair value methods (in
    addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
    services), representing 0.7% of net assets applicable to common shareowners.
    Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may include
    credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current market
    conditions and comparable securities.

    Discounts and premiums on debt securities are accreted or amortized,
    respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield to maturity
    basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost basis of the
    security. Premiums and discounts related to certain mortgage-backed
    securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the monthly paydowns.
    Interest income, including interest or income bearing cash accounts, is
    recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at
    the applicable country rates.

    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
    dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
    are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
    the exercise of reasonable diligence.

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/13 49
<PAGE>

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.  Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
    represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
    currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
    between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in market price of those securities but are included with
    the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.  Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

    The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
    the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
    future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
    exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in
    the Trusts financial statements. The Trust records realized gains and losses
    at the time a portfolio hedge is offset by entry into a closing transaction
    or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering
    into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
    the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of
    foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 5).

D.  Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trusts policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
    all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
    shareowners. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.
    As of May 31, 2013, the Trust did not have any interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be recorded
    as income tax expense on the Statement of Operations. Tax years for the
    prior three fiscal years remain subject to examination by federal and state
    tax authorities.

    The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
    shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
    which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
    Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are
    temporary overdistributions for financial statement purposes resulting from

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/13
<PAGE>

    differences in the recognition or classification of income or distributions
    for financial statement and tax purposes. Capital accounts within the
    financial statements are adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to
    reflect tax character, but are not adjusted for temporary differences.

    The tax character of current year distributions payable to shareowners will
    be determined at the end of the current taxable year. The tax character of
    distributions paid to shareowners during the year ended November 30, 2012
    was as follows:

    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized appreciation is
    primarily attributable to tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
    realization for tax purposes of unrealized gains on investments in passive
    foreign investment companies. The book/tax differences in the accrual of
    income on securities in default, the difference between book and tax
    amortization methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities
    and other temporary book/tax differences.

E.  Risks

    Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
    Trust's original offering prospectus with additional information included in
    the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
    those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
    Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
    interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
    economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
    those industries and sectors.

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/13 51
<PAGE>

    The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans).
    The Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
    including second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities
    and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in
    below investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are
    commonly referred to as junk bonds and are considered speculative with
    respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These
    securities involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price
    volatility, and are less liquid, especially during periods of economic
    uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt securities. The Trust may
    invest in securities of issuers that are in default or that are in
    bankruptcy. Additionally, the Trust may invest in "event-linked" bonds,
    which sometimes are referred to as "insurance-linked" or "catastrophe"
    bonds. The return of principal and the payment of interest on event-linked
    bonds are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger"
    event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. In
    addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds may expose the
    Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer (credit) default,
    adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax
    consequences.

    The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
    developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than
    would investments in a developed market. These risks include disruptive
    political or economic conditions and the possible imposition of adverse
    governmental laws or currency exchange restrictions.

    The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
    invested in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
    Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when
    the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is
    generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid
    securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the Trusts
    assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trusts ability to take
    advantage of market opportunities.

F.  Repurchase Agreements

    With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
    of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
    required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
    for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
    account of the Trusts custodian or a subcustodian of the Trust. PIM is
    responsible for determining that the value of the collateral remains at
    least equal to the repurchase price.

G.  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

    All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
    automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
    Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
    distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares
    of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in
    the Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends
    and capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is
    completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
    penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for
    shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to
    any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
    effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
    distribution.

    If a shareowners shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
    other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
    the Plan on the shareowners behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
    the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
    or nominee may reinvest a shareowners cash dividends in common shares of the
    Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

    Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
    participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
    acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
    but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
    outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
    on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share
    is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
    trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend
    amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common
    shares to be credited to each account will be determined by dividing the
    dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the
    date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
    current market price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%.
    If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common
    share is greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent
    will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market
    purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued
    common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
    brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agents open-market
    purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any
    federal, state or local taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any
    taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may not
    be able to transfer the shares to another broker and continue to participate
    in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit), manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. Managed assets means (a) the total assets
of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all accrued
liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not include
any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage obtained
through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation, borrowing
through a credit facility of the issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance
of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or (iii) any
other means. For the period ended May 31, 2013, the net management fee was 0.70%
of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.07% of
the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under PIMs management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May 31, 2013,
$372,497 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative costs
and certain other services and is included in Due to affiliates and
Administration fee on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

PIM retains Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (BBH) to provide certain
administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. For such
services, the Trust pays BBH a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.025% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets subject to a minimum monthly fee of $6,250.

3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all transfer
agent and shareowner services related to the Trusts common shares at negotiated
rates.

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.

4. Expense Offset Arrangement

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Trusts custodian expenses. For the period ended May 31, 2013, the Trust
expenses were not reduced under such an arrangement.

5. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into various forward foreign currency contracts that
obligate the Trust to deliver or take delivery of currencies at specified future
maturity dates. Alternatively, prior to the settlement date of a forward foreign
currency contract, the Trust may close out such contract by entering into an
offsetting contract.

At May 31, 2013, the Trust had no open forward portfolio or settlement
contracts.

6. Unfunded Loan Commitments

As of May 31, 2013, the Trust had no unfunded loan commitments.

The Trust had the following bridge loan commitment outstanding at May 31, 2013.

of May 31, 2013, there were 7,298 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,434, Series
W7,-2,432 and Series TH7-2,432.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7, and Series TH7, are cumulative at a rate
which is to be reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An
auction fails if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers.
When an auction fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate
on the auction dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred
shareowners will not be able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction
fails. Since February 2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have
failed. The maximum rate for each series is the greater of 125% of the one week
LIBOR rate or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS
ranged from 1.659% to 1.691% during the period ended May 31, 2013.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Statement of
Preferences are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. Holders of AMPS are also entitled to elect two
of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares and
(b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including, among other
things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end management
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

See note 10 regarding the planned redemption of outstanding AMPS.

9. Subsequent Events

The Board of Trustees of the Trust declared on June 3, 2013 a dividend from
undistributed net investment income of $0.075 per common share payable June 28,
2013, to shareowners of record on June 17, 2013.

Subsequent to May 31, 2013, dividends declared and paid on preferred shares
totaled $403,603 in aggregate for the outstanding preferred share series through
July 17, 2013.

10. Redemption of AMPS

The Trust intends to redeem all of its outstanding auction market preferred
shares ("AMPS") at the liquidation preference per share (sometimes referred to
as "at par"), together with accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, as of the
redemption date.

The Board of Trustees has authorized a third-party debt facility and the
redemption of the Trust's outstanding AMPS. The redemption of the Trust's AMPS
is subject to the successful negotiation of the new financing and the
satisfaction of certain notice and regulatory requirements and the closing
conditions of the new financing. Pioneer expects the redemption to be completed
by the end of 2013.

After the refinancing is completed, the Trust will continue to employ financial
leverage for investment purposes. At this time, the refinancing is not expected
to affect the Trust's monthly distribution rate per common share.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.
