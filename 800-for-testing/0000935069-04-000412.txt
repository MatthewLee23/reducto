   1. ORGANIZATION

      Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.  (formerly Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C.)
      (the  "Company")  was organized as a limited  liability  company under the
      laws of Delaware in January  1999.  The  Company is  registered  under the
      Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  (the "Act") as a closed-end,
      non-diversified  management  investment  company.  The  Company's  term is
      perpetual  unless the Company is otherwise  terminated  under the terms of
      the Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The
      Company's investment objective is to achieve maximum capital appreciation.
      It pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
      primarily of equity  securities of  technology  companies and of companies
      which derive a major portion of their revenue  directly or indirectly from
      technological  events and advances.  The Company's portfolio of securities
      in the  technology  area is expected to include  long and short  positions
      primarily in equity  securities  of U.S. and  non-U.S.  companies.  Equity
      securities  include common and preferred stock and other securities having
      equity  characteristics,  including  convertible  debt  securities,  stock
      options, warrants and rights.

      Responsibility   for  the  overall   management  and  supervision  of  the
      operations  of the Company is vested in the  individuals  who serve as the
      Board of  Managers  of the Company  ("Board of  Managers").  There are six
      members of the Board of Managers and an investment adviser.  The Company's
      investment  adviser is Advantage Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware
      limited liability company (the "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary of
      Oppenheimer  Asset Management Inc. ("OAM") and an affiliate of Oppenheimer
      & Co. Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is responsible  for managing the
      Company's  investment   activities  pursuant  to  an  investment  advisory
      agreement  dated June 5, 2003. OAM is the managing  member and controlling
      person of the Adviser.  Subject to the oversight of the Adviser, Mr. Takis
      Sparaggis,  the Managing  Director of Alkeon  Capital  Management,  L.L.C.
      ("Alkeon"), serves as portfolio manager of the Company. Alkeon is admitted
      as a non-managing  member of the Adviser.  Oppenheimer is a minority joint
      venture partner in Alkeon.

      On December  10, 2002,  Canadian  Imperial  Bank of  Commerce,  CIBC World
      Markets  Corp.  ("CIBC  WM"),  Fahnestock  & Co. Inc.  ("Fahnestock")  and
      Fahnestock Viner Holdings Inc.  ("FVH")  announced that Fahnestock and FVH
      had agreed to acquire the U.S. brokerage and asset management  business of
      CIBC WM,  including the Adviser.  The  acquisition  of the U.S.  brokerage
      business  closed on January 3, 2003. The acquisition by Fahnestock and FVH
      of CIBC WM's U.S. asset management business was completed on June 4, 2003.
      Consummation of the  acquisition of the Adviser  constituted an assignment
      of the Company's then existing investment advisory agreement. The Board of
      Managers  of the  Company  approved a new  investment  advisory  agreement
      between the Company and the Adviser at a meeting  held on January 24, 2003
      and the  Members  approved  the new  investment  advisory  agreement  at a
      special  meeting  of  Members  held on May 5,  2003.  In  September  2003,
      Fahnestock  & Co. Inc.  changed  its name to  Oppenheimer  & Co. Inc.  and
      Fahnestock  Viner Holdings Inc.  changed its name to Oppenheimer  Holdings
      Inc.

      The  acceptance of initial and  additional  contributions  from Members is
      subject to approval by the

   1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

      Board of Managers.  The Company may from time to time offer to  repurchase
      interests pursuant to written tenders by Members. Such repurchases will be
      made at such times and on such terms as may be  determined by the Board of
      Managers, in their complete and exclusive discretion.  The Adviser expects
      that generally it will recommend to the Board of Managers that the Company
      offer to repurchase  interests from Members twice each year,  effective at
      the end of the second fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser to
      make  estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the
      financial statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that the
      estimates  utilized in preparing the Company's  financial  statements  are
      reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from these
      estimates.

      A. REVENUE RECOGNITION

      Securities  transactions,  including  related  revenue and  expenses,  are
      recorded  on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded  on  the
      ex-dividend date, net of applicable withholding taxes. Interest income and
      expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on fixed
      income securities are amortized using the effective interest rate method.

      B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

      The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted by
      the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

      Prior to April 2003,  domestic  exchange  traded or NASDAQ  listed  equity
      securities  were valued at their last composite sale prices as reported on
      the  exchanges  where  such  securities  are  traded.  If no sales of such
      securities  were reported on a particular  day, the securities were valued
      based upon their  composite bid prices for securities  held long, or their
      composite asked prices for securities sold, not yet purchased, as reported
      by such exchanges.

      Pursuant to a resolution of the Company's Board of Managers passed on July
      31, 2003, the valuation  methodology set forth below for domestic exchange
      traded and NASDAQ  securities was put in effect reflecting the methodology
      made available by NASDAQ in April 2003.

      (i)   Domestic exchange  traded securities (other  than  options and those
            securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

         (1)   at their last composite sale prices as reported on the  exchanges
               where those securities are traded; or

                                      -6-

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         (2)   If no sales of those securities are reported on a particular day,
               the securities are valued  based upon their  composite bid prices
               for securities  held long,  or their  composite asked  prices for
               securities held short, as reported by those exchanges.

      (ii) Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

         (1)   at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP")  (which is the last
               trade price at or  before 4:00 PM (Eastern  Time) adjusted  up to
               NASDAQ's best offer price  if the last traded price is below such
               bid and  down to  NASDAQ's  best  offer  price if  the last trade
               is above such offer price); or

         (2)   if no NOCP  is available,  at the last sale  price on the  NASDAQ
               prior to  the calculation  of the net asset value of the Company;
               or

         (3)   if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

         (4)   if no sale is shown and no bid price is available, the price will
               be deemed  "stale" and the value will be determined in accordance
               with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

      Valuations of other non-NASDAQ traded equities remain as stated above.

      Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange will be valued at their
      last sale  prices on the  exchange  where such  securities  are  primarily
      traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular day, at their
      bid prices (in the case of  securities  held long) or asked prices (in the
      case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported by such exchange.
      Listed  options will be valued at their bid prices (or asked prices in the
      case of  listed  options  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  reported  by the
      exchange  with the  highest  volume on the last day a trade was  reported.
      Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will be
      valued at their bid  prices  (or  asked  prices in the case of  securities
      sold,  not yet  purchased)  as obtained  from one or more  dealers  making
      markets  for  those  securities.  If  market  quotations  are not  readily
      available,  securities  and other  assets  will be valued at fair value as
      determined  in good  faith by, or under the  supervision  of, the Board of
      Managers.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      Debt securities will be valued in accordance with the procedures described
      above,  which  with  respect to such  securities  may  include  the use of
      valuations  furnished  by a  pricing  service  which  employs  a matrix to
      determine  valuation  for  normal  institutional  size  trading  units  or
      consultation  with  brokers and dealers in such  securities.  The Board of
      Managers  will  periodically  monitor  the  reasonableness  of  valuations
      provided by any such  pricing  service.  Debt  securities  with  remaining
      maturities  of 60 days or less  will,  absent  unusual  circumstances,  be
      valued at amortized  cost, so long as such  valuation is determined by the
      Board of Managers to represent fair value.

      All assets and liabilities  initially expressed in foreign currencies will
      be converted into U.S.  dollars using foreign exchange rates provided by a
      pricing service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time.  Trading in foreign
      securities  generally is completed,  and the values of such securities are
      determined,  prior to the close of securities  markets in the U.S. Foreign
      exchange rates are also determined  prior to such close. On occasion,  the
      values of such  securities  and  exchange  rates may be affected by events
      occurring  between the time such values or exchange  rates are  determined
      and the time that the net asset value of the Company is  determined.  When
      such events materially affect the values of securities held by the Company
      or its liabilities, such securities and liabilities will be valued at fair
      value as  determined  in good faith by, or under the  supervision  of, the
      Board of Managers.

      C. CASH EQUIVALENTS

      The company treats all  highly-liquid  financial  instruments  that mature
      within  three  months  at the time of  purchase  as cash  equivalents.  At
      December 31, 2003, $77,786,724 in cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank.

      D. INCOME TAXES

      No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes on
      the profits of the Company is made as the Members are individually  liable
      for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

      The  Company  has  reclassified   ($5,641,503)   and   $125,272,652   from
      accumulated  net  investment  loss and  accumulated  net realized  gain on
      investments,  respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year
      ended December 31, 2003. This  reclassification  was a result of permanent
      book to tax  differences  to  reflect,  as an  adjustment  to net  capital
      contributions,  the amounts of taxable income,  loss and net realized gain
      on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members and had
      no effect on net assets.

   3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

      Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services  to  the  Company
      including,  among other things,  providing  office space and other support
      services.  In exchange for such services,  the Company pays  Oppenheimer a
      monthly  administration fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of the
      Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month. Prior to
      the  acquisition of the U.S.  brokerage  business,  fees for such services
      were paid to CIBC WM.

      During the year ended December 31, 2003,  Oppenheimer  earned  $312,162 as
      brokerage  commissions from portfolio  transactions  executed on behalf of
      the Company.  Mainsail Group, L.L.C., a broker-dealer affiliate of Alkeon,
      earned  $605,482 as  brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio  transactions
      executed on behalf of the Company.

      Net  profits  or net  losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
      allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of
      all Members  (but not the Special  Advisory  Member) as of the last day of
      each fiscal  period in  accordance  with  Members'  respective  investment
      percentages  for the fiscal  period.  The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
      Special  Advisory  Member  of the  Company,  is  entitled  to  receive  an
      incentive allocation (the "Incentive Allocation"),  charged to the capital
      account of each Member as of the last day of each  allocation  period,  of
      20% of the  amount by which  net  profits,  if any,  exceed  the  positive
      balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive  Allocation
      is credited to the Special  Advisory  Account of the Adviser.  By the last
      business  day of the  month  following  the  date on  which  an  Incentive
      Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of the Incentive
      Allocation that was credited to the Special  Advisory Account with respect
      to the  allocation  period.  During  the year  ended  December  31,  2003,
      incentive allocations of $22,876,014 were credited to the Special Advisory
      Account.

      Each  member  of  the  Board  of  Managers  (a  "Manager")  who  is not an
      "interested  person" of the  Company,  as defined by the Act,  receives an
      annual retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each meeting attended. Currently,
      one Manager is an  "interested  person" as defined by the Act. Any Manager
      who is an  "interested  person"  does not  receive any annual or other fee
      from the  Company.  All  Managers  are  reimbursed  by the Company for all
      reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by them in performing  their
      duties.

      PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian")  serves as custodian of the Company's
      assets.

      PFPC Inc. serves as Investor  Services and Accounting Agent to the Company
      and in that capacity provides certain accounting,  recordkeeping,  tax and
      investor  related  services.  The  Company  pays  PFPC an  accounting  and
      investor  services  fee based  primarily  on the average net assets of the
      Company as of the last day of each month,  payable  monthly,  subject to a
      minimum annual fee.

      Oppenheimer  acts as the  non-exclusive  placement  agent for the Company,
      without special  compensation from the Company, and bears costs associated
      with its activities as placement  agent.  However,  the placement agent is
      entitled to charge a sales commission of up to 3% (up to 3.1% of

      the amount  invested) in connection  with a purchase of interests,  at its
      discretion.  Such  sales  commissions  earned  by CIBC WM and  Oppenheimer
      amounted to $46,779 and $161,438, respectively.

   4. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

      Aggregate  purchases  and  sales  of  investment   securities,   excluding
      short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31, 2003, amounted to
      $1,679,972,441 and $1,629,419,136,  respectively.  Aggregate purchases and
      sales  of  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased,   excluding  short-term
      securities, for the year ended December 31, 2003, amounted to $444,217,637
      and $386,555,247, respectively.

      For Federal  income tax purposes,  at December 31, 2003,  accumulated  net
      unrealized  appreciation  on  investments  was  $14,920,302  consisting of
      $30,400,687 gross unrealized appreciation and $15,480,385 gross unrealized
      depreciation.

      Due from broker  primarily  represents  proceeds from securities sold, not
      yet purchased, and excess cash held at the prime broker as of December 31,
      2003.

   5. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

      The Company  has the  ability to trade on margin and, in that  connection,
      borrow funds from brokers and banks for  investment  purposes.  Trading in
      equity   securities  on  margin  involves  an  initial  cash   requirement
      representing at least 50% of the underlying  security's value with respect
      to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with respect to
      transactions in foreign  markets.  The Act requires the Company to satisfy
      an  asset  coverage  requirement  of 300% of its  indebtedness,  including
      amounts   borrowed,   measured  at  the  time  the   Company   incurs  the
      indebtedness.  The Company pays interest on outstanding  margin borrowings
      at an annualized rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%. The Company pledges securities
      as  collateral  for the  margin  borrowings,  which  are  maintained  in a
      segregated account held by the Custodian.  For the year ended December 31,
      2003,  the average daily amount of such  borrowings was $3,008,926 and the
      daily weighted average annualized interest rate was 1.74%.

   6. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE  SHEET RISK OR  CONCENTRATIONS  OF
      CREDIT RISK

      In the normal course of business,  the Company may trade various financial
      instruments and enter into various investment  activities with off-balance
      sheet risk.  These  financial  instruments  include options and securities
      sold, not yet purchased.  Generally, these financial instruments represent
      future  commitments  to purchase or sell other  financial  instruments  at
      specific  terms  at  specified  future  dates.  Each  of  these  financial
      instruments  contains  varying  degrees of off-balance  sheet risk whereby
      changes in the market value of the  securities  underlying  the  financial
      instruments may be in excess of the amounts recognized in the statement of
      assets, liabilities and members' capital.

   6. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE  SHEET RISK OR  CONCENTRATIONS  OF
      CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

      The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts which, at times, may
      exceed  federally  insured  limits.  The Company has not  experienced  any
      losses  in such  accounts  and  does  not  believe  it is  exposed  to any
      significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

      Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company to
      deliver  specified  securities and thereby creates a liability to purchase
      such  securities in the market at prevailing  prices.  Accordingly,  these
      transactions  result in off-balance  sheet risk as the Company's  ultimate
      obligation to satisfy the sale of securities  sold,  not yet purchased may
      exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of assets,  liabilities  and
      members' capital.

      The risk  associated  with purchasing an option is that the Company pays a
      premium whether or not the option is exercised.  Additionally, the Company
      bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value  should the
      counterparty  not  perform  under  the  contract.  Put  and  call  options
      purchased are accounted for in the same manner as investment securities.

      When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company is
      recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market
      value of the option written. If a call option is exercised, the premium is
      added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of the  underlying  security  in
      determining whether the Company has realized a gain or loss. In writing an
      option,  the Company bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the
      price of the security or index underlying the written option.  Exercise of
      an option  written by the Company  could result in the Company  selling or
      buying a security  at a price  different  from the current  market  value.
      During the year ended  December 31, 2003,  there were no  transactions  in
      written options.

                                  INTRODUCTION

Rule 206(4)-6 (the "Rule") adopted under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the "Advisers Act") requires all registered investment advisers that
exercise voting discretion over securities held in client portfolios to adopt
proxy voting policies and procedures.

Advantage Advisers, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Management, L.L.C., Advantage
Advisers Multi-Manager, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Private Equity Management,
L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Augusta Management, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Troon
Management, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Catalyst Management, L.P., Oppenheimer
Emerging Markets Management, L.L.C., Oppenheimer Horizon management, L.L.C.,
Oppenheimer Institutional Horizon Management, L.L.C., and Oppenheimer Value
Partners, L.P. (collectively, the "Advisers") are registered investment advisers
under the Advisers Act and are therefore required to adopt proxy voting policies
and procedures pursuant to the Rule.

The Advisers act as investment advisers, managers or general partners to
registered and unregistered investment companies and managed accounts
(collectively, the "Accounts"). When an Adviser has investment discretion over
an Account's investment portfolio, then the Adviser votes proxies for the
Account pursuant to the policies and procedures set forth herein.

Investment discretion for a number of the Advisers' Accounts is exercised by
portfolio managers that are either non-managing members of limited partners of
an Adviser, or act as portfolio managers or subadvisers pursuant to agreements
with the Advisers and/or the Accounts (collectively, the "Portfolio Managers").
In all cases where Portfolio Managers exercise investment discretion over the
Accounts, the Portfolio Managers vote proxies for the Accounts in accordance
with the policies and procedures of the investment advisory firms with which the
Portfolio Managers are affiliated.

Appendix A hereto sets forth the Accounts for which each Adviser is responsible,

                           VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES
                           ---------------------------
                            IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS
                            ------------------------

These proposals seek shareholder votes for persons who have been nominated by a
corporation's board of directors to stand for election to serve as members of
that board. No candidates are opposing these board nominees.

In each analysis of an uncontested election of directors you should review:
         a)  Company performance
         b)  Composition of the board and key board committees
         c)  Attendance at board meetings
         d)  Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity

We may also consider:
         a)  Board decisions concerning executive compensation
         b)  Number of other board seats held by the nominee
         c)  Interlocking directorships


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                           It is our policy to vote IN FAVOR of
                                           the candidates proposed by the board.

We will look carefully at each candidate's background contained in the proxy
statement. In the absence of unusual circumstances suggesting a nominee is
clearly not qualified to serve as a member of the board, we will vote with
management.

                                                                               5

CHAIRMAN AND CEO ARE THE SAME PERSON
- ------------------------------------


         Shareholders may propose that different persons hold the positions of
         the chairman and the CEO.

         We would evaluate these proposals on a case by case basis depending on
         the size of the company and performance of management.

                                                                               6

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
- -------------------------

         Shareholders may request that the board be comprised of a majority of
         independent directors and that audit, compensation and nominating
         committees of the Board consists exclusively of independent directors.
         We believe that independent directors are important to corporate
         governance.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                     It is our policy to vote
                                                     FOR proposals requesting
                                                     that a majority of the
                                                     Board be independent and
                                                     that the audit,
                                                     compensation and nominating
                                                     committees of the board
                                                     include only independent
                                                     directors.


                                                                               7

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
- ----------------------------

         Shareholders may propose that directors be required to own a minimum
amount of company stock or that directors should be paid in company stock, not
cash. This proposal is based on the view that directors will align themselves
with the interest of shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. We
believe that directors are required to exercise their fiduciary duty to the
company and its shareholders whether or not they own shares in the company and
should be allowed to invest in company stock based on their own personal
considerations.

                            CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
                            ------------------------

         Charitable contributions by companies are generally useful for
         assisting worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill between the
         company and its community. Moreover, there may be certain long-term
         financial benefits to companies from certain charitable contributions
         generated from, for example, movies spent helping educational efforts
         in the firm's primary employment areas. Shareholders should not decide
         what the most worthwhile charities are.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                        (Shareholders Proposals)

                                                        contribution.

         Shareholders have differing and equally sincere views as to which
         charities the company should contribute to, and the amount it should
         contribute. In the absence of bad faith, self-dealing, or gross
         negligence, management should determine which contributions are in the
         best interest of the company.

                                                                               9

                      DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION
                      ------------------------------------
                            AND LIABILITY PROTECTION
                            ------------------------

         These proposals typically provide for protection (or additional
         protection) which is to be afforded to the directors of a corporation
         in the form of indemnification by the corporation, insurance coverage
         or limitations upon their liability in connection with their
         responsibilities as directors.

         When a corporation indemnifies its directors and officers, it means the
         corporation promises to reimburse them for certain legal expenses,
         damages, and judgements incurred as a result of lawsuits relating to
         their corporate actions. The corporation becomes the insurer for its
         officers and directors.

                                                                              10

                                                proposals that would expand

                                                expenses to acts, such as
                                                negligence, that are more
                                                serious violations of fiduciary
                                                obligations than mere
                                                carelessness.

                                                providing such expanded coverage
                                                in cases when a director's or
                                                officer's legal defense was
                                                unsuccessful if: a) the director
                                                was found to have acted in good
                                                faith, and b) only if the
                                                director's legal expenses would
                                                be covered.

         The following factors should be considered:

         1.  The present environment in which directors operate provides
             substantial risk of claims or suits against against them in their
             individual capacities arising out of the discharge of their duties.

         2.  Attracting and retaining the most qualified directors enhances
             shareholder value.

                                                                              11

                                SIZE OF THE BOARD
                                -----------------

         Typically there are three reasons for changing the size of the board.
         The first reason may be to permit inclusion into the board of
         additional individuals who, by virtue of their ability and experience,
         would benefit the corporation. The second reason may be to reduce the
         size of the board due to expiration of terms, resignation of sitting
         directors or, thirdly, to accommodate the corporation's changing needs.

                                                decrease the size of the board.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  These proposals may aim at reducing or increasing the influence of
             certain groups of individuals.

         2.  This is an issue with which the board of directors is uniquely
             qualified to deal, since they have the most experience in sitting
             on a board and are up-to-date on the specific needs of the
             corporation.

                                                                              12

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS
- --------------------------------------------------

Votes in contested elections of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

The following factors are considered:

              1. management's track record
              2. background to the proxy contest
              3. qualifications of director nominees


                                                                              13

                                 --------------

This is a shareholder's proposal to limit the tenure of outside directors. This
requirement may not be an appropriate one. It is an artificial imposition on the
board, and may have the result of removing knowledgeable directors from the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote AGAINST shareholder
                                                proposals to limit the tenure of
                                                outside directors.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. An experienced director should not be disqualified because he or she
         has served a certain number of years.

         2. The nominating committee is in the best position to judge the
         directors' terms in office due to their understanding of a
         corporation's needs and a director's abilities and experience.

         3. If shareholders are not satisfied with the job a director is doing,
         they can vote him/her off the board when the term is up.

                                                                              14

                             -----------------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval of a request that the board of
directors disclose the amount of compensation paid to officers and employees, in
addition to the disclosure of such information in the proxy statement as
required by the SEC regulations.

                                                     reason to believe that
                                                     mandated disclosures are
                                                     insufficient to give an
                                                     accurate and meaningful

                                                     management compensation.


The following factors should be considered:

         1. Federal securities laws require disclosure in corporate proxy
         statements of the compensation paid to corporate directors and
         officers.

         2. Employees other than executive officers and directors are typically
         not in policy-making roles where they have the ability to determine, in
         a significant way, the amount of their own compensation.

         3. The disclosure of compensation of lower-level officers and employees
         infringes upon their privacy and might create morale problems.

                                                                              15

RATIFYING AUDITORS

Shareholders must make certain that auditors are responsibly examining the
financial statements of a company, that their reports adequately express any
legitimate financial concerns, and that the auditor is independent of the
company it is serving.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote FOR proposal to ratify
                                                auditors.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. Although lawsuits are sometimes filed against accounting firms,
         including those nationally recognized, these firms typically complete
         their assignments in a lawful and professional manner.

         2. Sometimes it may be appropriate for a corporation to change
         accounting firms, but the board of directors is in the best position to
         judge the advantages of any such change and any disagreements with
         former auditors must be fully disclosed to shareholders.

         3. If there is a reason to believe the independent auditor has rendered
         an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
         financial position, then in this case vote AGAINST ratification.

                                                                              17

                                  ------------


Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by
potential acquirers, do one or more of the following: a) dilute the acquirer's
equity in the target company, b) dilute the acquirer's voting interests in the
target company, or c) dilute the acquirer's equity holdings in the post-merger
company. Generally, poison pills accomplish these tasks by issuing rights or
warrants to shareholders that are essentially worthless unless triggered by a
hostile acquisition attempt.

A poison pill should contain a redemption clause that would allow the board to
redeem it even after a potential acquirer has surpassed the ownership threshold.
Poison pills may be adopted by the board without shareholder approval. But
shareholders must have the opportunity to ratify or reject them at least every
two years.

                                    GREENMAIL
                                    ---------

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the
market, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Greenmail payments usually expose the company to negative press and may result
in lawsuits by shareholders. When a company's name is associated with such a
practice, company customers may think twice about future purchases made at the
expense of the shareholders.

                                                     payments.

                                                     anti-Greenmail proposals
                                                     when they are bundled with
                                                     other charter or bylaw
                                                     amendments.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. While studies by the SEC and others show that Greenmail devalues the
         company's stock price, an argument can be made that a payment can
         enable the company to pursue plans that may provide long-term gains to
         the shareholders.

                                                                              20

                               SUPERMAJORITY VOTE
                               ------------------

Supermajority provisions violate the principle that a simple majority of voting
shares should be all that is necessary to effect change regarding a company and
its corporate governance provisions. These proposals seek shareholder approval
to exceed the normal level of shareholder participation and approval from a
simple majority of the outstanding shares to a much higher percentage.


VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                                     Vote AGAINST management
                                                     proposals to require a

                                                     vote to approve mergers and
                                                     other significant business
                                                     combinations.

                                                     Vote FOR shareholder
                                                     proposals to lower
                                                     Supermajority vote
                                                     requirements for mergers
                                                     and other significant
                                                     business combinations.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. Supermajority requirements ensure broad agreement on issues that may
         have a significant impact on the future of the company.

         2. Supermajority vote may make action all but impossible.

         3. Supermajority requirements are counter to the principle of majority
         rule.

                                                                              21

                             CHANGING CORPORATE NAME
                             -----------------------

This proposal seeks shareholder approval to change the corporation's name. It is
probably better to vote for the proposed name change before management goes back
to the drawing board and spends another small fortune attempting again to change
the name.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote FOR changing the corporate
                                                name.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. A name of a corporation symbolizes its substance.

         2. There are many reasons a corporation may have for changing its name,
         including an intention to change the direction of the business or to
         have a contemporary corporate image.

         3. The board of directors is well-positioned to determine the best name
         for the corporation because, among other reasons, it usually seeks
         professional advice on such matters.


                                                                              23

                                 ---------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to change the state in which a company
is incorporated. Sometimes this is done to accommodate the company's most active
operations or headquarters. More often, however, the companies want to
reincorporate in a state with more stringent anti-takeover provisions.
Delaware's state laws, for instance, including liability and anti-takeover
provisions, are more favorable to corporations.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                     Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE
                                                     basis, carefully reviewing
                                                     the new state's laws and
                                                     any significant changes the
                                                     company makes in its
                                                     charter and by-laws.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  The board is in the best position to determine the company's need
             to incorporate.

         2.  Reincorporation may have considerable implications for
             shareholders, affecting a company's takeover defenses, its
             corporate structure or governance features.

         3.  Reincorporation in a state with stronger anti-takeover laws may
             harm shareholder value.

                 BOARD STRUCTURE: STAGGERED VS. ANNUAL ELECTIONS
                 -----------------------------------------------

A company that has classified, or staggered, board is one in which directors are
typically divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year terms;
each class's reelection occurs in different years. In contrast, all directors of
an annually elected board serve one-year and the entire board stands for
election each year.

Classifying the board makes it more difficult to change control of a company
through a proxy contest involving election of directors. Because only a minority
of the directors are elected each year, it will be more difficult to win control
of the board in a single election.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals to
                                                     classify the board. Vote
                                                     FOR proposals to repeal
                                                     classified boards and to
                                                     elect all directors
                                                     annually.

The following factors should be considered:

              1. The annual election of directors provides an extra check on
                 management's performance. A director who is doing a good job
                 should not fear an annual review of his/her directorship.


                                                                              26

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING
                                -----------------

Most companies provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each
share owned, the so-called "one share, one vote" standard. This proposal seeks
to allow each shareholder to cast votes in the election of directors
proportionate to the number of directors times the number of shares owned by
each shareholder for one nominee.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION                                      Vote AGAINST proposals
                                                         that permit cumulative
                                                         voting.


The following factors should be considered:

         1.  Cumulative voting would allow a minority owner to create an impact
             disproportionate to his/her holdings.

         2.  Cumulative voting can be used to elect a director who would
             represent special interests and not those of the corporation and
             its shareholders.

         3.  Cumulative voting can allow a minority to have representation.

         4.  Cumulative Voting can lead to a conflict within the board which
             could interfere with its ability to serve the shareholders' best
             interests.


                                                                              27

                  SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETING
                  ---------------------------------------------

Most state corporation statutes allow shareholders to call a special meeting
when they want to take action on certain matters that arise between regularly
scheduled annual meetings.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                              Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict
                                              or prohibit shareholder ability to
                                              call special meetings.

                                              Vote FOR proposals that remove
                                              restrictions on the right of
                                              shareholders to act independently
                                              of management.



                                                                              28

                SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO ALTER SIZE OF THE BOARD
                ------------------------------------------------

Proposals which would allow management to increase or decrease the size of the
board at its own discretion are often used by companies as a takeover defense.

Shareholders should support management proposals to fix the size of the board at
a specific number of directors, preventing management from increasing the size
of the board without shareholder approval. By increasing the size of the board,
management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                                Vote FOR proposal which seek to
                                                fix the size of the board.

                                                Vote AGAINST proposals which
                                                give management the ability to
                                                alter the size of the board
                                                without shareholder approval.

                               CONFIDENTIAL VOTING
                               -------------------

Confidential voting, also known as voting by secret ballot, is one of the key
structural issues in the proxy system. All proxies, ballots, and voting
tabulations that identify individual shareholders are kept confidential.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                                Vote FOR shareholder proposals
                                                requesting that corporations
                                                adopt confidential voting.

                                                Vote FOR management proposals to
                                                adopt confidential voting.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  Some shareholders elect to have the board not know how they voted
             on certain issues.

         2.  Should the board be aware of how a shareholder voted, the board
             could attempt to influence the shareholder to change his/her vote,
             giving itself an advantage over those that do not have access to
             this information.

         3.  Confidential voting is an important element of corporate democracy
             which should be available to the shareholder.


                                                                              31

                         SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES
                         -------------------------------

These proposals request that the corporation establish a shareholder advisory
committee to review the board's performance. In some instances, it would have a
budget funded by the corporation and would be composed of salaried committee
members with authority to hire outside experts and to include reports in the
annual proxy statement.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote AGAINST proposals to
                                                establish a shareholder advisory
                                                committee.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  Directors already have fiduciary responsibility to represent
             shareholders and are accountable to them by law, thus rendering
             shareholder advisory committees unnecessary.

                            -------------------------

These proposals are usually submitted by companies incorporated outside of the
United States seeking shareholder approval for actions which are considered
ordinary business and do not require shareholder approval in the United States
(i.e., declaration of dividends, approval of financial statements, etc.).

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote FOR proposals that concern
                                                foreign companies incorporated
                                                outside of the United States.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  The laws and regulations of various countries differ widely as to
             those issues on which shareholder approval is needed, usually
             requiring consent for actions which are considered routine in the
             United States.

         2.  The board of directors is well-positioned to determine whether or
             not these types of actions are in the best interest of the
             corporation's shareholders.

                                                                              33

                             GOVERNMENT SERVICE LIST
                             -----------------------

This proposal requests that the board of directors prepare a list of employees
or consultants to the company who have been employed by the government within a
specified period of time and the substance of their involvement.

Solicitation of customers and negotiation of contractual or other business
relationships is traditionally the responsibility of management. Compilation of
such a list does not seem to serve a useful purpose, primarily because existing
laws and regulations serve as a checklist on conflicts of interest.

                                                by the government.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  For certain companies, employing individuals familiar with the
             regulatory agencies and procedures is essential and, therefore, is
             in the best interests of the shareholders.

         2.  Existing laws and regulations require enough disclosure and serve
             as a check on conflicts of interest.

         3.  Additional disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of such
             individual's privacy.

CERES proposals ask management to sign or report on process toward compliance

Principle 10 directs companies to fill out the CERES report. This report
requires companies to disclose information about environmental policies, toxic
emissions, hazardous waste management, workplace safety, energy use, and

                              ---------------------

It is well documented that Northern Ireland's Catholic community faces much
higher unemployment figures then the Protestant community. Most proposals ask
companies to endorse or report on progress with respect to the MacBride
Principles.

In evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride Principles, you must decide if
the principles will cause the company to divest, and worsen unemployment
problems.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  We believe that human and political rights are of the utmost
             importance for their own sake as well as for the enhancement of
             economic potential of a nation.

In regards to equal employment and discrimination, companies without

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  We feel that the hiring and promotion of employees should be free
             from prohibited discriminatory practices. We also feel that many of
             these issues are already subject to significant state and federal
             regulations.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  Needless cruelty to animals should never be tolerated. However, the
             testing of products on animals may be very important to the health
             and safety of consumers.

                           COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZATION
                           --------------------------

The ability to increase the number of authorized shares could accommodate the
sale of equity, stock splits, dividends, compensation-based plans, etc. The
board can usually be trusted to use additional shares for capital-raising and
other transactions that are in the corporation's best interests.

However, excessive escalation in the number of authorized shares may allow the
board to radically change the corporation's direction without shareholder
approval. Be careful to view that the increased number of shares will not enable
the company to activate a poison pill.

         2.  Is the company expanding its operations?

         3.  Within the company, are there any debt structuring or prepackaged
             bankruptcy plans?

The terms of blank check preferred stock give the board of directors the power
to issue shares of preferred stock at their discretion, with voting, conversion,
distribution and other rights to be determined by the board at the time of the
issue.

Blank check preferred stock can provide corporations with the flexibility to
meet changing financial conditions. However, once the blank check preferred
stock has been authorized, the shareholders have no further power over how or
when it will be allocated.

                                -----------------

These proposals request that the corporation provide existing shareholders with
an opportunity to acquire additional shares in proportion to their existing
holdings whenever new shares are issued. In companies with a large shareholder
base and ease in which shareholders could preserve their relative interest
through purchases of shares on the open market, the cost of implementing
preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  The existence of preemptive rights can considerably slow down the
             process of issuing new shares due to the logistics involved in
             protecting such rights.

         2.  Preemptive rights are not necessary for the shareholder in today's
             corporations, whose stock is held by a wide range of owners and is,
             in most cases, highly liquid.

                    ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK
                    ----------------------------------------

The purpose of par value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility of
stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. It represents the
maximum amount that a shareholder must pay the corporation if the stock is to be
fully paid when issued.

The corporation requests permission to reduce the par value of its stock. In
most cases, adjusting par value is a routine financing decision and should be
supported.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                   Vote FOR management proposals
                                                   to reduce the par value of
                                                   common stock.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  State laws sometimes prohibit issuance of new stock priced below
             that of the outstanding shares.

         2.  A corporation may be unable to raise capital if the par value is
             overstated.


                                                                              47

DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS
- -------------------

The corporation may propose to increase common and/or preferred shares and to
issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION                          It is our policy to vote
                                             CASE-BY-CASE on debt restructuring.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  Dilution - How much will ownership interest of existing
             shareholders be reduced and how extreme will dilution to future
             earnings be?

         2.  Change in Control - Will the transaction result in a change of
             control of the company?

         3.  Bankruptcy - Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in
             severe losses in shareholder value, the main factor driving the
             debt restructuring?


                                                                              48

                              ---------------------

Directors represent shareholders and are responsible for protecting shareholder
interests. Companies state in the proxy material that they pay directors well in
order to attract the most qualified candidates. All compensation packages for
any executive, director or employee should include a pay-for-performance
component.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for
                                                director compensation.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  As directors take an increasingly active role in corporate
             decision-making and governance, their compensation is becoming more
             performance-based.


                                                                              50

            SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO LIMIT EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY
            --------------------------------------------------------

Shareholder compensation proposals that set limits or reduce executive
compensation should be closely scrutinized. Many of these proposals may be
flawed in their emphasis on an absolute dollar figure in compensation.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION                             Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.


The following factors should be considered:

         1.  Executive compensation is established by a committee that consists
             of independent directors who have fiduciary responsibility to act
             in the best interest of the shareholders and who are best placed to
             make compensation decisions.


                                                                              51

                     EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)
                     --------------------------------------

These proposals ask for stockholder endorsement of compensation plans for key
employees which involve the issuance of company shares by granting of stock
options, SARs, restricted stock, etc. These plans help attract and retain
best-qualified corporate personnel and tie their interests more closely to those
of the shareholders.

                                                when the following items are
                                                involved:

         1.  The exercise price for stock options is less than 85% of fair
             market value on the date of the grant.

         2.  It is an omnibus stock plan which gives directors broad discretion
             in deciding how much and what kind of stock to award, when and to
             whom.

         3.  The shares for issue exceed 8% of the company's outstanding shares;
             or, in the case of the evergreen plans, the amount of increase
             exceeds 1.5% of the total number of shares outstanding.

                                                involved:

         1.  Re-load options (new options issued for any exercised).

         2.  The plan would allow for management to pyramid their holdings by
             using stock to purchase more stock, without having to lay out cash.
             Vote YES if this is for directors.

                                -----------------

Golden parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the
event of a change in control. The change in control agreement will specify the
exact payments to be made under the golden parachutes. The calculation for
payout is usually based on some multiple of an employee's annual or monthly
compensation. Golden parachutes are generally given to employees whose annual
compensation exceeds $112,000.

Recent experience has shown a willingness of many managements to treat severance
agreements as equal to equity investments and to reward themselves as if
substantial amounts of equity were at risk.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote FOR proposals which seek to

                                                payments.

                                                submitted for shareholder
                                                ratification.


The following factors should be considered:

         1.  The stability of management may be affected by an attempted
             acquisition of the corporation.

         2.  There is a tendency on the part of an entrenched management to
             overstate the value of their continuing control of and influence on
             the day-to-day functions of a corporation.

                       CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals suggest that the board of directors solicit shareholder approval
before committing acquisitions or divestiture of a business exceeding stipulated
threshold levels. Such statutes function by denying shares their voting rights
when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals
                                                     which request the board to
                                                     seek shareholder approval
                                                     before committing to an
                                                     acquisition.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  These proposals deprive the board of directors of its ability to
             act quickly in propitious circumstances.

         2.  Conforming to these requirements can be expensive.

         3.  The board of directors is uniquely qualified and positioned to be
             able to make these decisions without prior shareholder approval.

         4.  The threshold levels usually imposed by these proposals are much
             more stringent than required by law.


                                                                              58

                       OPT-OUT OF STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to opt-out (not be governed by)
certain provisions of the anti-takeover laws of various states. Delaware law,
for instance, dictates that a bidder has to acquire at least 85% of a company's
stock before exercising control, unless he or she has board approval. This means
that a company may thwart an otherwise successful bidder by securing 15% of its
stock in friendly hands.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for
                                                these proposals.

The following factors should be considered:

         1.  It is the directors' responsibility to act on behalf of the
             shareholders in opposing coercive takeover attempts.

         2.  Creating deterrents to corporate takeovers may allow for
             entrenchment of inefficient management.

         3.  These statutes strengthen the board's ability to deal with
             potential buyers on fair and reasonable terms.

         4.  Shareholders should have the final say on whether the company
             should be merged or acquired.


                                                                              59

CONFLICTS
- ---------

From time to time, proxy voting proposals may raise conflicts between the
interests of the Advisers' clients and the interests of the Advisers, their
affiliates and their employees. Conflicts of interest may arise when:

         1.  Proxy votes regarding non-routine matters are solicited by an
             issuer that may have a separate account relationship with an
             affiliate of an Adviser or an investment banking relationship with
             Fahnestock & Co. Inc., an affiliate of the Advisers.

         2.  A proponent of a proxy proposal has a business relationship with an
             Adviser or one of its affiliates or an Adviser or one of its
             affiliates has a business relationship with participants in proxy
             contests, corporate directors or director candidates.

         3.  An employee of an Adviser has a personal interest in the outcome of
             a particular matter before shareholders.

If an Adviser receives a proxy that to the knowledge of the Proxy Manager raises
a conflict of interest, the Proxy Manager shall advise the Governance Committee
which shall determine whether the conflict is "material" to any specific
proposal involved in the proxy. The Governance Committee will determine whether
the proposal is material as follows:

         1.  Routine proxy proposals are presumed not to involve a material
             conflict of interest.

         2.  Non-routine proxy proposals-Proxy proposals that are "non- routine"
             will be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest unless
             the Governance Committee determines that the conflict is unrelated
             to the proposal. Non-routine proposals would include a merger,
             compensation matters for management and contested elections of
             directors.


                                                                              62

CONFLICTS CONT'D
- ----------------

         3.  The Governance Committee may determine on a case by case basis that
             particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material conflict
             of interest because the proposal is not directly related to an
             Adviser's conflict vis-a-vis the issue. The Governance Committee
             will record the basis for any such determination. With respect to
             any proposal that the Governance Committee determines presents a
             material conflict of interest, an Adviser may vote regarding that
             proposal in any of the following ways:

              a) Obtain instructions from the client on how to vote.

              b) Use existing proxy guidelines if the policy with respect to the
                 proposal is specifically addressed and does not involve a case
                 by case analysis.

              c) Vote the proposal that involves the conflict according to the
                 recommendations of an independent third party, including, but
                 not limited to, Institutional Share Services Inc. or Investor
                 Responsibilsity Research Center.

SPECIAL ISSUES WITH VOTING FOREIGN PROXIES


    Voting proxies with respect to shares of foreign stock may involve
significantly greater effort and corresponding cost than voting proxies in the
U.S domestic market. Issues in voting foreign proxies include the following:

         1.   Each country has its own rules and practices regarding shareholder
              notification, voting restrictions, registration conditions and
              share blocking.

         2.   In some foreign countries shares may be "blocked" by custodian or
              depository or bearer shares deposited with specific financial
              institutions for a certain number of days before or after the
              shareholders meeting. When blocked, shares typically may not be
              traded until the day after the blocking period. The Advisers may
              refrain from voting shares of foreign stocks subject to blocking
              restrictions where in an Adviser's judgment, the benefit from
              voting the shares is outweighed by the interest in maintaining
              client liquidity in the shares. This decision is made on a case by
              case basis based on relevant factors including the length of the
              blocking period, the significance of the holding and whether the
              stock is considered a long-term holding.


         3.   Time frames between shareholder notification, distribution of
              proxy materials, book closures and the actual meeting date may be
              too short to allow timely action.

         4.   In certain countries, applicable regulations require that votes
              must be made in person at the shareholder meeting. The Advisers
              will weigh the costs and benefits of voting on proxy proposals in
              such countries on a case by case basis and make decisions on
              whether voting on a given proxy proposal is prudent. Generally,
              the Advisers will not vote shares in any such markets on routine
              matters such as uncontested elections of directors, ratification
              of auditors, etc.


                                                                              68

                                 RECORD KEEPING



                                                                              69

RECORD KEEPING
- --------------

The Advisers will maintain the following records:

         1.   Copies of these policies

         2.   A copy of each proxy statement that an Adviser receives regarding
              client securities. An Adviser may satisfy this requirement by
              relying on a third party to keep copies of proxy statements
              provided that the Adviser has an undertaking from the third party
              to provide a copy of the proxy statement promptly upon request.

         3.   A record of each vote cast on behalf of a client. A third party
              may keep these voting records provided that the Adviser has an
              undertaking from the third party to provide a copy of the record
              promptly upon request.

         4.   A copy of any document created by an Adviser that was material to
              making a decision on how to vote proxies or that memorializes the
              basis for that decision.

         5.   A copy of each written client request for information on how the
              Advisers voted proxies on behalf of the client and a copy of
              written response by an Adviser to any client request for
              information on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the
              client.

The above records shall be maintained for five years from the end of the fiscal
year during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in
an appropriate office of the Advisers.


                                                                              70

                         ALKEON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC
                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
                               As of June 30, 2003
I.       POLICY

         Proxy voting is an important right of shareholders and reasonable care
and diligence must be undertaken to ensure that such rights are properly and
timely exercised. When Alkeon Capital Management, LLC ("Alkeon") has discretion
to vote the proxies of its clients, it will vote those proxies in the best
interest of its clients and in accordance with these policies and procedures.

II.      PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES

         (a) All proxies received by Alkeon will be sent to Alkeon's Compliance
Officer, currently Greg Boye. The Compliance Officer will:

              (1) Keep a record of each proxy received;

              (2) Determine if there are any routine proposals and vote them
accordingly (see Section III). If there are non-routine proposals, the
Compliance Officer will then forward the proxy to the Portfolio Manager or
Analyst responsible for that given security;

              (3) Determine which accounts managed by Alkeon hold the security
to which the proxy relates;

              (4) Provide the Portfolio Manager or Analyst with the date by
which Alkeon must vote the proxy in order to allow enough time for the completed
proxy to be submitted to the issuer prior to the vote taking place.

              (5) Absent material conflicts (see Section IV), the Portfolio
Manager or Analyst will determine how Alkeon should vote the proxy. The
Portfolio Manager or Analyst will send his or her decision on how Alkeon will
vote a proxy to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer is responsible
for completing the proxy and entering the vote information in the ADP ProxyEdge
system, or mailing the proxy in a timely manner if ADP ProxyEdge is not
available.

III.     VOTING GUIDELINES

         In the absence of specific voting guidelines from the client, Alkeon
will vote proxies in the best interests of each particular client, which may
result in different voting
<PAGE>

results for proxies for the same issuer. Alkeon believes that voting proxies in
accordance with the following guidelines is in the best interest of its clients.

         o    Generally, Alkeon will vote in favor of routine corporate
              housekeeping proposals, including election of directors (where no
              corporate governance issues are implicated) and selection of
              auditors.

         o    Generally, Alkeon will vote against proposals that make it more
              difficult to replace members of the issuer's board of directors,
              including proposals to stagger the board, cause management to be
              over represented on the board, introduce cumulative voting,
              introduce unequal voting rights, and create supermajority voting.

         o    Alkeon has determined that in most cases it will vote for the
              expensing of stock options as the consensus feeling is that
              options are an actual expense of a given issuer unless in
              extraordinary circumstances approved by the Compliance Officer.


         For other proposals, Alkeon shall determine whether a proposal is in
the best interests of its clients and may take into account the following
factors, among others:

         (1) whether the proposal was recommended by management and Alkeon's
opinion of management;

         (2) whether the proposal acts to entrench existing management; and

         (3) whether the proposal fairly compensates management for past and
future performance.

IV.      CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         (1) The Compliance Officer will identify any conflicts that exist
between the interest of Alkeon and its clients. This examination will include a
review of the relationship of Alkeon and its affiliates with the issuer of each
security and any of the issuer's affiliates to determine if the issuer or its
management is a client of Alkeon or an affiliate of Alkeon or has some other
relationship with Alkeon or a client of Alkeon. Examples of conflicts would be
voting on any security of Bank of America or Fahnstock, as Alkeon manages funds
sponsored by both entities.

         (2) If a material conflict exists, the Compliance Officer will
determine whether voting in accordance with the voting guidelines and factors
described above is in the best interest of the client. The Compliance Officer
will ensure that all proposals are voted in the best interest of the client by
having all material conflicts reviewed by a proxy voting committee consisting of
the Compliance Officer and two Portfolio Managers.
<PAGE>

V.       DISCLOSURE

         (a) Alkeon will disclose in its Form ADV Part II that clients may
contact the Compliance Officer via e-mail at gboye@alkeoncapital.com or
telephone at (212) 389-8704 in order to obtain information on how Alkeon voted
such client's proxies, and to request a copy of these policies and procedures.
If a client requests this information, the Compliance Officer will prepare a
report to the client that lists, with respect to each voted proxy that the
client has inquired about, (1) the name of the issuer; (2) the proposal voted
upon and (3) how Alkeon voted the client's proxy.

         (b) A concise summary of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
will be included in Alkeon's Form ADV Part II, and will be updated whenever
these policies and procedures are updated. The Compliance Officer will arrange
for a copy of this summary to be sent to all existing clients either as a
separate mailing or along with a periodic account statement or other
correspondence sent to clients.

VI.      RECORDKEEPING

         The Compliance Officer will maintain files relating to Alkeon's proxy
voting procedures in Alkeon's office at 350 Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York,
NY 10017. Records will be maintained and preserved for five years from the end
of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on a record, with
records for the first two years kept in the offices of Alkeon. Records of the
following will be included in the files:

         (a) Copies of these proxy voting policies and procedures, and any
amendments thereto.

         (b) A copy of each proxy statement that Alkeon receives, provided
however that Alkeon may rely on obtaining a copy of proxy statements from the
SEC's EDGAR system for those proxy statements that are so available.

         (c) A record of each vote that Alkeon casts on behalf of clients.

         (d) A copy of each written client request for information on how Alkeon
voted such client's proxies, and a copy of any written response to any (written
or oral) client request for information on how Alkeon voted its proxies.

         (e) A copy of any document Alkeon created that was material to making a
decision how to vote proxies, or that memorializes the basis for decision.

                                                                       July 2003

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO RULES
        PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (the "Code") of the registered investment companies
set forth in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to
each Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth
in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Fund;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or the Covered Officer's
service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts
<PAGE>

may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between a Fund
and its investment adviser or a third party service provider of which the
Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the applicable Fund or for its investment adviser or a
third party service provider, or for one or more of them), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser, third party service provider and Fund. The participation
of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationship between a Fund and its adviser or third party service provider and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. The foregoing activities, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company.

         Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o   not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
         influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
         whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
         of the Fund;

     o   not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Fund; and

     o   report at least annually his or her affiliations or other relationships
         that could potentially present a conflict of interest with the Fund.


III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each Covered Officer of a Fund shall become familiar with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     o   each Covered Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly misrepresent, or
         cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
         within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's management and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

     o   each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent appropriate within
         the Covered Officer's area of responsibility and to the extent deemed
         necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer, consult with
         other officers and employees of the Fund and its investment adviser
         with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
         understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
         the Fund; and

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

     o   each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
         Fund with applicable standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
         laws, rules and regulations.


IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the
         Fund that the Covered Officer has received, read and understands the
         Code;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that
         the Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

     o   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
         Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations of
         the Code that are made in good faith; and

     o   notify the Compliance Officer of the Fund promptly if the Covered
         Officer knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself
         a violation of this Code.

         The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code
to specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with counsel to
the Fund and counsel to the Managers of the Fund who are not "interested
persons," as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, of the
Fund (the "Independent Managers"), and is encouraged to do so. However, any
approvals or waivers 1 must be considered by the Independent Managers.

         Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o   the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any reported potential violations;

     o   if, after such investigation, the Compliance Officer believes that no
         violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
         any further action;

     o   any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
         reported to the Independent Managers;

     o   if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred, the
         Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
         which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of,
         and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment


- ----------
1    For this purpose, the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund of a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the Fund's
     failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics that has been
     made known to Fund management.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         adviser or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to
         dismiss the Covered Officer; and

     o   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.


V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's investment adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act of each Fund, its investment adviser and principal
underwriter is a separate requirement applying to the Covered Officers and
others, and is not part of this Code.


VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Amendments to this Code may be made from time to time, as deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance Officer. The Board of each Fund shall be
informed of any such amendment to the extent deemed material by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.


VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records relating to a Fund prepared or maintained
pursuant to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained
and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code,
such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.


VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
