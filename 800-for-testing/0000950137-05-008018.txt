ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

The Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based
statistical composite of Pennsylvania municipal bonds. The index is unmanaged
and does not include any sales charges or fees. Such costs would lower
performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 6-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2005

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust is managed by the Adviser's
Municipal Fixed Income team.(1) Current members include Dennis Pietrzak and John
Reynoldson, Executive Directors of the Adviser; and Robert Wimmel, Vice
President of the Adviser.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The six-month period ended April 30, 2005, was characterized by continued
short-term interest rate increases. As crude oil prices reached record highs,
the prospect of rising inflation also cast a shadow. The Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") raised the federal funds target rate 100 basis points
during the period through a series of four "measured" 0.25 percent tightenings
to 2.75 percent by the end of April. Although rates in the short and
intermediate areas of the yield curve shifted upward as the Fed tightened, long-
term interest rates fell as buyers did not seem deterred by the prospect of
rising inflation. As a result, the yield curve (the difference between short and
longer-term yields) flattened and the long end of the municipal market handily
outperformed the shorter end.

The municipal market in total posted positive returns during the period, though
it was not uniformly strong. In contrast to the strong showing by longer-term
bonds, shorter-term municipals were hampered by the Fed's tightening and turned
in a flat to slightly negative showing. Within the investment-grade segment of
the market, yield differentials between BBB-rated and AAA-rated municipal
securities were slightly wider, though BBB-rated securities still outperformed
high grades due to their higher coupons, while securities rated below investment
grade strongly outperformed as investors sought out their higher yields.

The Fed's interest rate hikes did not appear to dampen investors' appetites for
municipal bonds, as net inflows into municipal bond funds topped $290 million
during the period. The supply of new issues was modest during the closing months
of 2004 (the first two months of the period) before soaring in the opening
months of 2005 as long-term issuers rushed to bring securities to market in
anticipation of additional interest rate increases in the near term.

The most significant development in the Pennsylvania municipal market during the
period was the ongoing trend of refundings of municipal securities by issuers.
Municipal borrowers were able to take advantage of rising short-term rates and
relatively stable long-term rates, which in turn allowed them to refund
outstanding debt. As a result, the Pennsylvania market saw a wave of
refinancings, especially in education-related sectors.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ, as they did during the reporting period. On an NAV basis,
the trust outperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania
Municipal Bond Index. On a market price basis, the trust underperformed its
benchmark.

AND INDEX DEFINITION.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Fed's policy of
raising interest rates throughout the period made the trust's borrowing activity
more expensive. These expenses, however, were more than offset by the positive
performance of the bonds held by the trust.

One of our key strategies in managing the trust during the period was to
position it for rising interest rates. This approach was largely the result of
our analysis of interest rates, which remained relatively low by historical
standards even after rising from their multi-decade lows earlier. First, we kept
the trust's duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity) below that of its
benchmark. Second, to limit the trust's exposure to areas of the market that
would be most likely susceptible to rising rates, we trimmed the trust's
shorter-maturity bonds. We reinvested the proceeds from those sales into bonds
with premium coupons and maturities between 20 and 30 years. In addition to
offering relatively attractive income streams, these securities positioned the
trust to benefit from any future flattening of the yield curve.

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

We kept the trust's exposure well diversified across the major sectors of the
Pennsylvania municipal market. Much of our relative-value trading activity was
focused on selling issues that had been pre-refunded, many of which were in the
public education sector; and purchasing what we believed to be more attractive
securities in the public education sector. The trust remained focused on
investment-grade securities, with 100 percent of the portfolio rated BBB or
higher at the end of the period.

There is no guarantee the security sectors mentioned will continue to perform
well or be held by the trust in the future.

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered
as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is
to seek to provide a high level of current income exempt from federal and
Pennsylvania income taxes and, where possible under local law, local income and
personal property taxes, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust will
invest substantially all of its assets in Pennsylvania municipal securities
rated investment grade at the time of investment, but may invest up to 20% of
its assets in unrated securities which are believed to be of comparable quality
to those rated investment grade. The Trust commenced investment operations on
April 30, 1993.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. As of April 30, 2005, the Trust had $3,354,723 of when-issued
and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
of the Trust. Effective November 1, 2004, the investment advisory fee was
reduced from .60% to .55%.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $3,000 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the six months ended
April 30, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $18,300
representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van
Kampen") cost of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which are
reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, on the Statement
of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $13,744,039 and $13,578,754,
respectively.

5. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust has outstanding 1,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"). Dividends are
cumulative and the dividend rate is currently reset every seven days through an
auction process. The rate in effect on April 30, 2005 was 2.850%. During the six
months ended April 30, 2005, the rates ranged from 1.500% to 2.850%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may invest up to 15% of its net assets in "inverse floating rate
obligations." The inverse floating rate obligations in which the Trust may
invest are typically created through a division of a fixed-rate municipal
obligation into two separate instruments, a short-term obligation and a
long-term obligation. The interest rate on the short-term obligation is set at
periodic auctions. The interest rate on the long-term obligation which the

 18
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

Trust may purchase is the rate the issuer would have paid on the fixed-income
obligation, (i) plus the difference between such fixed rate and the rate on the
short-term obligation, if the short-term rate is lower than the fixed rate; or
(ii) minus such difference if the interest rate on the short-term obligation is
higher than the fixed rate. These securities have varying degrees of liquidity
and the market value of such securities generally will fluctuate in response to
changes in market rates of interest to a greater extent than the value of an
equal principal amount of a fixed rate security having similar credit quality,
redemption provisions and maturity. These securities tend to underperform the
market for fixed rate bonds in a rising interest rate environment, but tend to
outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates decline or remain
relatively stable. Although volatile, inverse floating rate obligations
typically offer the potential for yields exceeding the yields available on fixed
rate bonds with comparable credit quality, coupon, call provisions and maturity.
These securities usually permit the investor to convert the floating rate
security counterpart to a fixed rate (normally adjusted downward), and this
optional conversion feature may provide a partial hedge against rising rates if
exercised at an opportune time.

                                                                              19
