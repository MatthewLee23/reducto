THE CHINA FUND, INC.
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Stockholders:

During the six months ended April 30, 2004, your Fund's net asset value
decreased by -1.03% after taking into consideration the US$1.78 per share
distribution paid to shareholders in January 2004. Although the Chinese economy
continued to grow rapidly, it began to seem almost too rapid to some, most
notably the People's Bank of China (PBOC). Thus, as the PBOC introduced
tightening measures, China stocks were sold-off. This was despite continuing
strong results from Chinese corporations.

Worries that China's economy might not be able to achieve a 'soft landing' drove
the premium in the price of the Fund's Shares down from 29.00% to 5.03% as of
April 30, 2004, while the annualized expense ratio as of April 30, 2004, has
fallen to 1.36%.

China's economy made a rapid recovery from the SARS slow-down and some sectors
have started to overheat. The Central Government has taken steps to slow down
fixed investments in the steel, cement, and real estate industries. We believe
that this will lead to a mid-cycle correction and that the longer-term growth
trend will continue. Those sectors that have thrived on the successful
ingredients of low cost production, skilled labour and globalization of the
value chain should continue to maintain their impressive growth. Like the 1994
slowdown, we believe that this tightening of the economy should offer good
investment opportunities for the Direct Investment Portfolio. During the period
under review, the Direct Investment Manager added one investment, teco
Optronics, to the Direct Investment Portfolio. teco Optronics is a specialist
manufacturer of innovative organic light-emitting diode display ("OLED") panels.

The Board of Directors remains optimistic about the long-term growth prospects
for China. We believe that the Fund remains one of the best ways to access such
growth through investment in a selection of entrepreneurial Chinese companies.
The recent market sell-off means that there are now better values to be had. We
believe that China is making progress on some of its more pressing structural
problems, such as the reform of the state-owned sector, but more work needs to
be done, particularly on China's moribund financial system. Against this
background, investors should expect to see further volatility in Chinese
equities.

We thank you for your continuing support and for your interest in our Fund. If
you have any questions, comments or would like additional information on our
Fund's holdings, we invite you to visit the Fund's website at
www.chinafundinc.com or call (toll free) 1-888-CHN-CALL (246-2255).

Sincerely,

/s/ Alan Tremain

Chairman of the Board

THE CHINA FUND, INC.
INVESTMENT MANAGERS' STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVIEW OF LISTED INVESTMENTS
In the last few weeks there have been many media and broker reports about a
slowdown in China's economic growth, about the government's credit-tightening
measures and even an "austerity program". Your managers, based in Shanghai,
travel extensively in China, and we just do not see it. We do not believe that
there will be an appreciable slowdown in Chinese growth in the near term. We
also do not believe that this is what the government wants, given its desperate
need to create employment. What is happening is that the government is trying to
prevent the misallocation of capital to certain 'hot' industries - the four
so-called 'evil sectors' - steel, aluminium, cement and luxury property
development. This is a perennial problem in China caused by the combination of
an as yet unreformed, state-owned financial sector and, ironically for a
dictatorship, weak central control over the provinces. There are other sectors
where the government is keen to promote investment. In an interview with Reuters
last week, Premier Wen Jia Bao said, "We are now faced with very serious
shortages of coal, power, oil and transport."

It appears that investors in global equity and bond markets are now worrying
about the end of the cheap money era. China, having been a hot market in 2003,
has been affected the most. But, it is not clear if a modest rise in interest
rates in the United States and China (the two seem likely to move in parallel
given the current currency peg) will have as great an impact on the latter as
the former. China has a high savings rate and consumer finance and mortgage
lending are in their infancy here. Meanwhile, listed Chinese companies,
especially in the private sector, tend to have a low level of gearing. The more
developed cities, such as Shanghai, would be more affected by higher rates than
the rest of the country, but not as much as San Francisco, New York and London.

The recent sharp correction means that there are now many high growth companies
which can be bought for a price earnings multiple below 10x. We estimate that
the whole portfolio now trades on a price/earnings ratio of 12x, with earnings
growth of 21% and a yield of about 2.4%. Recent first quarter results from
portfolio companies, such as SOHU and CATHAY LIFE, have been strong; the few
disappointments, such as CHENG SHIN TYRE, have been caused by inflation in costs
offsetting top-line growth.

Over the past six months, we did more selling than buying, raising cash levels
and preparing money for new unlisted investments. We took profits on textile
stocks by selling long-term holdings FOUNTAIN SET, JINGWEI TEXTILE MACHINERY,
LUTHAI TEXTILE and TAINAN ENTERPRISES. This is an industry where we expect trade
conflict with the United States in early 2005. We also sold CHINA MOTOR and
BRILLIANCE CHINA because we are worried about plans for capacity expansion.
Towards the end of this quarter, we took decent profits from recovering foundry
maker VANGUARD, STN-LCD panel maker WINTEK as well as richly valued H-shares
such as ANHUI CONCH and YANZHOU COAL. We also sold TAIWAN HONCHUAN based on
disappointing first quarter results and BEIJING AIRPORT due to its expensive
valuation.

On the buy side, we added investments in some neglected technology stocks such
as COMBA, a well managed manufacturer of telecom infrastructure equipment,
foundry UMC, DVD maker CMC, China's leading electronics distributor, DIGITAL
CHINA, and 3C retailer TSANN KUENN. We added to our holding in CHINA RARE EARTH
as we expect rare earth and refractory prices to recover. We also bought YIEH
UNITED, the only integrated

REVIEW OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS
During the six months under review, market sentiment towards China investments
underwent a significant change. Investors' sentiment was initially buoyed by the
resilience of the Chinese economy in the wake of the SARS outbreak and the
launching of a number of successful China listings in Hong Kong and on the
NASDAQ. However, around March 2004, investors began to fret over the risks of
overheating. China has since announced a series of measures aimed at slowing
down the economy. The authorities acted relatively early in this cycle when
inflation was still at a modest level of around 4%. We believed that the secular
story for China is still intact and that this mid-cycle correction will present
good opportunities for direct investments.

The Fund added one new investment to its Direct Investment portfolio. We
invested in TECO OPTRONICS CORP., a Taiwanese company that designs and
manufactures organic light-emitting diode displays ("OLED").

As of April 30, 2004, the Fund's Direct Investment portfolio comprised the
following investments:

CAPTIVE FINANCE LIMITED ("CAPTIVE")
Captive is engaged in providing operating and financial leases for technology
products (PCs, servers, telecom equipment etc.). It has operations in Greater
China, Singapore, Malaysia and Europe. Apart from seeking leasing opportunities
within each of its national markets, Captive is also building cross-selling and
other synergies between the Asian and European operations.

TOMOIKE INDUSTRIAL (HK) LIMITED ("TOMOIKE")
Tomoike manufactures a wide range of sheet materials such as labels, speaker
cushions, and cushion materials for office equipment and household appliances.
Its fastest growing business is the assembly of backlight unit components for
the mobile phone industry. For more than a decade, Tomoike has been supplying
parts and accessories for office and consumer equipment of major Japanese
manufacturers. Its business is experiencing profit growth strongly above budget
as a result of robust demand for its products, especially the backlight units.

TECO OPTRONICS CORP. ("TECO")
teco designs and manufactures OLED displays and has a licensing agreement with
Kodak. OLED is a new flat screen display technology that is competing with
liquid crystal displays ("LCDs"). teco is a subsidiary of the TECO Group which
started out as an industrial motor manufacturer and has since diversified into
home appliances, information technology and many other business areas. Its
flagship company, TECO Electric and Machinery, has been listed on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange since 1973.

Notes to Schedule of Investments

  * Denotes non-income producing security

(1) Direct investments are generally restricted as to resale and do not have a
    readily available resale market. On the date of acquisition of each direct
    investment, there were no market quotations on similar securities, and such
    investments were therefore initially valued at acquisition cost. These
    direct investments are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of
    Directors as discussed in Note A and B to the Financial Statements.

THE CHINA FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The China Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated under the laws of the State
of Maryland on April 28, 1992, and is a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. The Fund's investment objective is long-term capital appreciation
through investments in the equity securities of companies engaged in a
substantial amount of business in the People's Republic of China. The following
is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements.

USE OF ESTIMATES:  The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
income and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. The significant estimates made as of, and for the six months ended,
April 30, 2004 relate to the valuation of the Fund's Direct Investments, as
further discussed below and in Note B.

SECURITY VALUATION:  Portfolio securities listed on recognized United States or
foreign securities exchanges are valued at the last quoted sales price in the
principal market where they are traded. Listed securities with no such sales
price and unlisted securities are valued at the mean between the current bid and
asked prices, if any, of two brokers. Short-term investments having maturities
of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost (original purchase cost as
adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount) which when
combined with accrued interest approximates market value. Securities for which
market quotations are readily available are valued at current market value.
Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued in
good faith at fair value using methods determined by the Board of Directors.
Direct Investments not traded on an exchange are valued at fair value as
determined by the Board of Directors based on advice from the Investment Manager
and Direct Investment Manager. The Direct Investment's original cost is
considered to be fair value unless the Board of Directors, based on such advice,
concludes there has been a material change of a long-term nature and sufficient
reliable information is available to revalue these investments.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:  In connection with transactions in repurchase
agreements, it is the Fund's policy that its custodian take possession of the
underlying collateral securities, the fair value of which exceeds the principal
amount of the repurchase transaction, including accrued interest, at all times.
If the seller defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS:  The records of the Fund are maintained in U.S.
dollars. Foreign currencies, investments and other assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates. Purchases and sales
of investment securities and income and expenses are translated on the
respective dates of such transactions. Net realized gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions represent net gains and losses from the disposition of
foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized between the trade dates
and settlement dates of security transactions, and the difference between the
amount of net investment income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually
received. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
investments in securities are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
the effects of changes in market prices of those securities, but are included in
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONS CONTRACTS:  The Fund may purchase and write (sell) call options and put
options provided the transactions are for hedging purposes and the initial
margin and premiums do not exceed 5% of total assets. Option contracts are
valued daily and unrealized gains or losses are recorded based upon the last
sales price on the principal exchange on which the options are traded. The Fund
will realize a gain or loss upon the expiration or closing of the option
contract. When an option is exercised, the proceeds on sales of the underlying
security for a written call option, the purchase cost of the security for a
written put option, or the cost of the security for a purchased put or call
option is adjusted by the amount of premium received or paid.

The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for
profit if the market price of the security increases and the option is
exercised. The risk in writing a put option is that the Fund may incur a loss if
the market price of the security decreases and the option is exercised. The risk
in buying an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is
exercised. Risks may also arise from an illiquid secondary market or from the
inability of counter parties to meet the terms of the contract.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:  Security transactions are recorded
as of the trade date. Realized gains and losses from securities sold are
recorded on the identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date, or, in the case of dividend income on foreign securities, on
the ex-dividend date or when the Fund becomes aware of its declaration. Interest
income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums and discounts are
amortized/accreted for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

Dividend and interest income generated in Taiwan is subject to a 20% withholding
tax. Stock dividends received (except those which have resulted from
Capitalization of capital surplus) are taxable at 20% of the par value of the
stock dividends received. The Fund records the taxes paid on stock dividends as
an operating expense.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS:  The Fund intends to distribute to its
shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its net investment income
and any net realized capital gains. Income and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from
generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of foreign currency transactions and losses deferred due to
wash sales.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:  The Fund has qualified and intends to qualify in the
future as a regulated investment company by complying with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code available to certain investment companies, including
making distributions of taxable income and capital gains sufficient to relieve
it from all, or substantially all, federal income and excise taxes.

NOTE B -- VALUATION OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS
At April 30, 2004, Direct Investments amounting to $5,848,467 (2.3% of net
assets) have been valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors
in the absence of readily ascertainable market values. The procedures applied by
the Board of Directors in arriving at its estimate of value of securities
without readily available market values comply with the Fund's policies for
valuing Direct Investments at original cost unless the Board of Directors, based
on advice from the Direct Investment Manager, concludes that there has been a

material change of a long-term nature and sufficient reliable information is
available to revalue these investments. Determination of fair values involves
subjective judgment and, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the
Board of Directors' estimated values may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the
differences could be material.

NOTE C -- ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Martin Currie Inc. is the investment manager for the Fund's listed assets (the
"Listed Assets") and was paid a fee, computed weekly and payable monthly, at the
following annual rates from November 1, 2003 through March 18, 2004: 1.00% of
the first US$25 million of the Fund's average weekly net assets invested in
Listed Assets; 0.90% of the next US$25 million of the Fund's average weekly net
assets invested in Listed Assets; 0.70% of the next US$25 million of the Fund's
average weekly net assets invested in Listed Assets; and 0.50% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets invested in Listed Assets in excess of US$75 million.
Effective March 19, 2004, Martin Currie Inc. is paid a fee, computed weekly and
payable monthly at the following annual rates: 0.70% of the first US$400 million
of the Fund's average weekly net assets invested in Listed Assets; and 0.50% of
the Fund's average weekly net assets invested in Listed Assets in excess of
US$400 million.

Asian Direct Capital Management ("ADCM") is the investment manager for the
Fund's assets allocated to Direct Investments. ADCM receives a fee, computed
weekly and payable monthly, at an annual rate equal to the greater of $300,000
or 2.2% of the average weekly value of the net assets of the Fund invested in
Direct Investments.

No director, officer or employee of the Investment Manager or Direct Investment
Manager or any affiliates of those entities will receive any compensation from
the Fund for serving as an officer or director of the Fund. The Fund pays the
Chairman of the Board and each of the directors (who is not a director, officer
or employee of the Investment Manager or Direct Investment Manager or any
affiliate thereof) an annual fee of $27,500 and $10,000, respectively, plus
$2,000 for each Board of Directors' meeting or Audit Committee meeting attended.
In addition, the Fund will reimburse each of the directors for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending Board of Directors'
meetings.

NOTE D -- CAPITAL STOCK
The Board of Directors of the Fund has approved a share repurchase plan. Under
the program, the Fund will repurchase shares at management's discretion at times
when it considers the repurchase to be consistent with the objectives of the
program. For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the Fund did not participate
in this program.

NOTE E -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the Fund's cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities, other than short-term securities,
were $49,665,367 and $74,599,787, respectively. At April 30, 2004, the cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes was $160,074,218. Gross unrealized
appreciation of investments was $89,463,502, while gross unrealized depreciation
of investments was $8,277,538, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of
investments of $81,185,964.

NOTE F -- INVESTMENTS IN CHINA
The Fund's investments in China companies involve certain risks not typically
associated with investments in securities of U.S. companies or the U.S.
Government, including risks relating to (1) social, economic and political
uncertainty; (2) price volatility, lesser liquidity and smaller market
capitalization of securities markets in which securities of China companies
trade; (3) currency exchange fluctuations, currency blockage and higher rates of
inflation; (4) controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of
invested capital and on the Fund's ability to exchange local currencies for U.S.
dollars; (5) governmental involvement in and control over the economy; (6) risk
of nationalization or expropriation of assets; (7) the nature of the smaller,
less seasoned and newly organized China companies, particularly in China; and
(8) the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting
standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision
and regulation.

shareholders from the following sources:

     [ ]  Information it receives from shareholders on applications or other

     [ ]  Information about shareholder transactions with the Fund.

THE FUND'S POLICY IS TO NOT DISCLOSE NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ITS

law).

The Fund restricts access to nonpublic personal information about its

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS;
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund will distribute to shareholders, at least annually, substantially all
of its net investment income from dividends and interest earnings and expects to
distribute any net realized capital gains annually. Pursuant to the Dividend
Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"), adopted by the Fund, each
shareholder will be deemed to have elected, unless Equiserve Trust Company,
N.A., the Plan Administrator, is otherwise instructed by the stockholder in
writing, to have all distributions automatically reinvested by the Plan
Administrator in Fund shares pursuant to the Plan. Shareholders who do not
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash paid by check in
U.S. dollars mailed directly to the stockholder by Equiserve Trust Company,
N.A., as paying agent. Shareholders who do not wish to have distributions
automatically reinvested should notify the Fund by contacting EquiServe c/o The
China Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3010. Phone:
1-800-426-5523.

Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. ("EquiServe") or the ("Plan Administrator"), a
federally chartered trust institution, acts as Plan Administrator. EquiServe,
Inc. an affiliate of EquiServe and a transfer agent registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, acts as Service Agent for EquiServe. If the
Directors of the Fund declare an income dividend or a capital gains distribution
payable either in the Fund's Common Stock or in cash, as shareholders may have
elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the
Plan will receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund. If the market price
per share on the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per share on
that date, the Fund will issue new shares to participants at net asset value or,
if the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price on the valuation
date, then at 95% of the market price. The valuation date will be the dividend
or distribution payment date or, if that date is not a trading day on the
exchange on which the Fund's shares are then listed, the next preceding trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time,
participants in the Plan will be deemed to have elected to receive shares of
stock from the Fund, valued at market price on the valuation date. If the Fund
should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable only in cash,
the Plan Administrator will, as administrator for the participants, buy Fund
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, with the
cash in respect of such dividend or distribution, for the participant's account
on, or shortly after, the payment date.

Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional payments to the
Plan Administrator, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000 for investment
in the Fund's Common Stock. The Plan Administrator will use all funds received
from participants (as well as any dividends and capital gains distributions
received in cash) to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about January
15 of each year. Any voluntary cash payments received more than thirty days
prior to such date will be returned by the Plan Administrator, and interest will
not be paid on any uninvested cash payments. To avoid unnecessary cash
accumulations, and also to allow ample time for receipt and processing by the
Plan Administrator, it is suggested that participants send in voluntary cash
payments to be received by the Plan Administrator approximately ten days before
January 15. A participant may withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written
notice, if the notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours
before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Administrator maintains all stockholder accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmations of all transactions in the account, including
information needed by shareholders for personal and tax records. Shares in

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS;
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the account of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator in
non-certificated form in the name of the participant, and each stockholder's
proxy will include those shares purchased pursuant to the Plan.

In the case of shareholders, such as banks, brokers or nominees, which hold
shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Administrator will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the stockholder as representing the total amount registered in the
stockholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are
participating in the Plan.

There is no charge to participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gains
distributions. The Plan Administrator's fees for the handling of the
reinvestment of dividends and distributions will be paid by the Fund. However,
each participant's account will be charged a pro rata share of brokerage
commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Administrator's open market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains
distributions. A participant will also pay brokerage commissions incurred in
purchases from voluntary cash payments made by the participant. Brokerage
charges for purchasing small amounts of stock for individual accounts through
the Plan are expected to be less than the usual brokerage charges for such
transactions, because the Plan Administrator will be purchasing stock for all
participants in blocks and prorating the lower commission thus attainable.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax which may be payable on such dividends and
distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payment made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
notice of the change sent to all shareholders at least 90 days before the record
date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Administrator by at least 90 days' written notice to all
shareholders. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe c/o The China Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, Rhode Island
02940-3010. Phone: 1-800-426-5523.

                                 CERTIFICATIONS

I, Gary L. French, certify that:

1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The China Fund, Inc.;

2.       Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
         such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
         information included in this report, fairly present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
         include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
         establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
         the registrant and have:

         (a)      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (c)      Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the
                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                  to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

         (b)      Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The China Fund, Inc.;

2.       Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
         such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
         information included in this report, fairly present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
         include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
         establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
         the registrant and have:

         (a)      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)      Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (c)      Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the
                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                  to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

         (b)      Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
