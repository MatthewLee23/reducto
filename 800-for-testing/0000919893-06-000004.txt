                             GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

<S>                          <C>
                             Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the
                             specialized expertise of three world-class investment management groups--
                             Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE        Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying
                             on its own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                             that underlie its success.

                             FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized leader in fixed income
                             investing and also brings expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                             investing.

                             TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing
                             and, in 1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                             Today, with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers investors a truly
                             global perspective.

                             MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style of
                             value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among what it believes
                             are undervalued stocks, as well as arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION         Because our management groups work independently and adhere to different
                             investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically
                             have distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be used to build truly
                             diversified allocation plans covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST    At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
                             with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the reliable,
                             accurate and personal service that has helped us become one of the most
                             trusted names in financial services.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS

CHANGE IN NON-FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT POLICY

On December 1, 2005, the Fund's Board of Directors approved a change in
non-fundamental investment policy to permit investment of up to 15% of the
Fund's assets in a single issuer. The Fund formerly had a non-fundamental
operating policy that permitted the Fund's Investment Manager to invest up to
10% of the Fund's assets in a single issuer.

Management believes that this change is in the best interests of the Fund and
its shareholders because it gives the Fund greater investment flexibility to
pursue its investment objective of capital appreciation in light of current
market conditions.

Enabling the Fund to invest a greater portion of its assets in a single issuer,
and thus potentially fewer issuers, involves potential risks, including the risk
that changes in the value of a single issuer's securities may have a greater
effect on the Fund's performance and share price.

REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program, which was
originally implemented in October 1997. The Fund's Board of Directors had
discontinued the open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection
with the Fund's previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund
may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's Investment Manager.

Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Templeton Dragon Fund covers the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Templeton Dragon Fund posted cumulative total returns of +14.08% in market price
terms and +21.20% in net asset value terms for the year under review. You can
find the Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance Summary beginning
on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Economic growth was strong in the region where the Fund invests. As a result of
a new and more detailed economic survey, the Chinese government raised its 2004
gross domestic product (GDP) estimate by US$284 billion to almost US$2 trillion
in November, an increase of about 17%.(1) Based on this revision, China moved
ahead of Italy to become the world's sixth largest economy. Despite China's
strong economic growth, inflation remained benign, averaging 1.8% for the
12-month period.(1) Although the yuan appreciated against the U.S. dollar by
2.5% since the beginning of the year, China's trade sector experienced robust
growth, with the trade surplus surging 333% to US$90.8 billion in the first 11
months of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004 (year-over-year).(2)
Foreign direct investment (FDI) into China totaled US$53.1

billion in the same period, down 1.9% year-over-year.(1) However, pledged FDI
was up 24.0% year-over-year to US$167 billion, indicating strong investment
flows into China from foreign investors.(1)

Hong Kong reported favorable economic data during the period. Third quarter
2005 GDP growth was 8.2% year-over-year, bringing growth for the first nine
months of the year to 7.2%.(3) Key drivers included strong exports and domestic
demand. The government expects the economy to expand 7% for the entire year.(3)
Unemployment was on a downward trend, ending November at 5.3%.(3) Inflation
remained relatively mild, increasing 1.7% year-over-year in November.(3) This
led the government to lower its 2005 inflation forecast to 1.2% from 1.5%,
ending nearly six years of deflation.(3) Property prices came under pressure as
investors remained cautious in view of rising interest rates. Politics came to
the forefront during the year with the resignation of Tung Chee-Hwa as chief
executive. He was replaced by Donald Tsang.

In Taiwan, a rebound in exports supported third quarter 2005 GDP expansion to
an annualized 4.4%, an acceleration from the revised annualized 3.0% recorded
in the second quarter.(4) Exports rose 7.1% year-over-year during the quarter,
compared to 6.1% in the preceding quarter.(5) Private consumption also
supported the economic recovery, increasing 3.7%, higher than the 3.0% recorded
in the second quarter.(4) Inflation remained under control as the central bank
maintained a tightening policy, gradually increasing interest rates to reverse
the island's negative real interest rates. The government forecast inflation to
increase 2.3% in 2005 and 1.3% in 2006.(4) Politically, the ruling democratic
progressive party lost significant support to the opposition party Kuomintang
(KMT) in local elections.

Although equity markets in the greater China region started 2005 on a weak
note, market sentiment turned positive in the latter part of the year with the
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) China Index returning +19.77% in
U.S. dollar terms.(6) China continued to attract new funds, making 2005 a
record year for new equity issuance. Although the Hong Kong stock market was
adversely affected by rising interest rates for most of the period, investors
seemed to react favorably to robust economic growth, falling unemployment and
news of a possible halt to interest rate hikes in the U.S.

The Taiwan market had a volatile year as poor political sentiment, slow economic
growth in the first half of the year and a scare in the credit card business
affected the banking sector. However, apparently attracted by cheap valuations
and conclusion of the local elections, investors returned in the last quarter of
the year, which allowed the Taiwan market to end the period in positive
territory.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

In the year under review, our stock selection generally helped the Fund's
performance relative to the MSCI China Index, as we held many stocks that were
not part of the index. The Fund's overweighted positions in the food and
staples retailing (not in the index) and technology hardware and equipment
industries were among the largest contributors to relative performance.(7)
Stock selection in the semiconductors and semiconductor equipment industry and
an underweighted allocation to the transportation sector further supported
performance.(8) Within the food and staples retailing and technology hardware
and equipment industries, our positions in Dairy Farm International Holdings
and Acer, which are not in the index, as well as no exposure to ZTE, had the
greatest positive impact. Dairy Farm operates supermarkets, drug stores,
convenience stores and restaurants in Asia. The stock performed extremely well
mainly due to greater private consumption in the region.

(7)   The technology hardware and equipment sector comprises communications
      equipment, computers and peripherals, electronic equipment and
      instruments, office electronics, and semiconductors and semiconductor
      equipment in the SOI.

(8)   The transportation sector comprises air freight and logistics, airlines,
      and transportation infrastructure in the SOI.


4 | Annual Report
<PAGE>

In the semiconductors and semiconductor equipment industry, the Fund's holdings
in Taiwanese semiconductor companies, Siliconware Precision Industries and
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, as well as Samsung Electronics in South
Korea, were significant performance contributors on an absolute basis, as well
as relative to the index. These stocks performed well and are not index
components. The Fund's lack of exposure to transportation sector stocks such as
Guangshen Railway, China Shipping Development and China Southern Airlines helped
Fund performance relative to the index since those stocks underperformed.

The largest negative impact on relative performance resulted from the Fund's
underweighted exposure to the energy and telecommunication services sectors as
well as an overweighted position in commercial banks.(9) Stocks that hurt
relative performance the most included underweighted positions in PetroChina,
China Mobile and no holding in CNOOC. We increased the Fund's investments in
PetroChina and China Mobile during the reporting period, but did not invest in
CNOOC. We sought to increase the Fund's energy sector allocation via what we
considered the better valued PetroChina. The Fund's position in HSBC Holdings,
which is not in the index, caused the greatest negative impact in the
commercial banks sector. HSBC has a large international presence, and we
believe it is in a position to benefit from the growing global demand for
banking services in the long term.

During the reporting period, the Fund's largest investments were in China H
shares (Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies). Key purchases included China
Construction Bank, one of the country's largest commercial banks; PetroChina, a
dominant player in the oil, gas and consumable fuels industry; and Air China,
the national flag carrier. Elsewhere, the Fund made selective investments in
South Korea and the U.K. These included LG, a prominent multi-holding company
with a broad product line that ranges from basic chemicals to LCD televisions.
The LG brand is fast becoming a household name in China. We also added shares of
HSBC Holdings, one of the largest banking and financial services organizations
in the world.

On the other hand, we reduced the Fund's exposure to selective Hong Kong and
Taiwanese companies. Major partial sales included Hang Lung Group, a Hong Kong
real estate company; Delta Electronics, a leading Taiwanese elec-

(9)   The energy sector comprises electric utilities; independent power
      producers and energy traders; and oil, gas and consumable fuels in the
      SOI. The telecommunication services sector comprises diversified
      telecommunication services and wireless telecommunication services.

tronic equipment manufacturer; and The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, the owner
and operator of seven hotels including the prestigious Peninsula Hotel in Hong
Kong. One of the Fund's largest sales was Henderson China Holdings as a result
of its privatization by the parent company, Henderson Land. The company is
involved in property development and property investment in China.

TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Directors.


                                                              Annual Report | 17

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income
and net realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Funds may be subject to foreign taxation. Foreign
taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax regulations and rates that exist in
the foreign markets in which the Fund invests.

TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from foreign
securities are recognized as soon as the Fund is notified of the ex-dividend
date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are
determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These differences may
be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital
accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no impact
on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program. Originally
implemented in October 1997, the Fund's Board of Directors had discontinued the
open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection with the Fund's
previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund may purchase,
from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market
transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.


                                                              Annual Report | 19

$857,852 from reinvested distributions. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
there were no share transactions; all reinvested distributions were satisfied
with previously issued shares purchased in the open market.

$2,565.

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31, 2005

                                   2005          2004

                               $28,973,456   $21,181,481
                               =========================

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions.

primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales and foreign currency
transactions.

(depreciation), undistributed ordinary income and undistributed long term
capital gains for income tax purposes were as follows:

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. PREVIOUS LITIGATION

Pursuant to a settlement agreement which was announced on March 20, 2003,
between the Fund and Harvard College, a former shareholder of the Fund, Harvard
Management Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor
to Harvard College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management at the
time (referred to collectively as "Harvard"), the Fund agreed to take, and the
Board approved, the following actions, among other actions, which have already
been carried out.

      o     IN-KIND TENDER OFFERS--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an
            exemptive order allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic
            tender offers, each for up to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares
            at a price equal to 95% of net asset value per share as of the date
            the offer expires, to be paid entirely in kind through a pro rata
            distribution of marketable port- folio securities and available
            cash. Subject to certain conditions, the settlement required the
            Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for 20% of the Fund's
            shares within three months after obtaining the SEC exemption. The
            Fund has also been required under the set- tlement to conduct, on
            substantially identical terms, up to two additional in-kind tender
            offers under certain circumstances. There is no assurance that the
            SEC will issue the exemptive order, nor is it possible to predict
            the date when an exemptive order might be granted.

      o     ADDITIONAL CASH TENDER OFFERS--If the SEC did not issue the
            exemptive order for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the
            settlement provided that the Fund could, but was not obligated to,
            conduct an additional cash tender offer, and possibly later
            follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15% of the Fund's
            outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per share
            as of the date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if
            the Fund did not conduct these tender offers, Harvard would be
            relieved of its obligation to refrain from making shareholder
            proposals and taking other actions with respect to the Fund. The
            exemptive application was not received by March 26, 2004 and the
            Fund did not conduct any tender offers for the period ended December
            31, 2005.

The settlement agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.

9. PREVIOUS LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, Inc., nor to encourage
others to do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any
time to acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or
similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, relating to certain practices in the
mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators.

Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning market timing (the "August 2, 2004 SEC
Order") and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund
shares (the "December 13, 2004 SEC Order") and with the California Attorney
General's Office ("CAGO") concerning marketing support payments to securities
dealers who sell fund shares (the "CAGO Settlement"). Under the terms of the
settlements with the SEC and the CAGO, the Company retained an Independent
Distribution Consultant ("IDC") to develop a plan for distribution of the
respective settlement monies. The CAGO approved the distribution plan under the
CAGO Settlement and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
settlement, the monies were disbursed to the relevant funds. The Fund did not
participate in the CAGO Settlement. The SEC has not yet approved the
distribution plan pertaining to the December 13, 2004 SEC Order. When approved,
disbursements of settlement monies will be made promptly to the relevant funds,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of that order. The IDC continues to
develop the plan of distribution under the August 2, 2004 SEC Order that
resolved the SEC's market timing investigation.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, directors, and/or
employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as shareholder class
actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or
Franklin Resources, Inc.) relating to the industry practices referenced above,
as well as to allegedly excessive advisory fees, commissions, and/or 12b-1 fees.
The lawsuits were filed in different courts throughout the country. Many of
those suits are now pending in a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intends to defend
against them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual
outcome of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact
on the Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for
any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2005, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attention:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares in the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.


                                                              Annual Report | 27

TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (CONTINUED)

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services LLC,
P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant
will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's
name for all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant
wishes, the Plan Administrator will sell the participant's shares and send the
proceeds, less a service charge and less trading fees. The fees for the sale of
shares through the Plan are $15.00 per transaction plus a $0.12 per share
trading fee.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

Under Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $18,688,502 as a
capital gain dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.

Under Section 854(b)(2) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $4,002,972 as qualified dividends for purposes of the
maximum rate under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005. In January 2006, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV
which will include their share of qualified dividends distributed during the
calendar year 2005. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors
for information on the treatment of these amounts on their individual income tax
returns.

Under Section 871(k)(1)(C) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $658,662 as interest-related dividends for purposes
of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of the Code for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2005.

Under Section 871(k)(2)(C) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $3,177,162 as a short-term capital gain dividend for
purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of the Code for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2005, more than 50% of the Fund's total assets were invested in
securities of foreign issuers. In most instances, foreign taxes were withheld
from dividends paid to the Fund on these investments. As shown in the table
below, the Fund designates to shareholders the foreign source income and foreign
taxes paid as allowed, pursuant to Section 853 of the Code. This designation
will allow shareholders of record on December 30, 2005, to treat their
proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid
directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes
paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by
the Fund to shareholders of record.

TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a minimum of 16
days during the 31-day period beginning 15 days before the ex-dividend date of
the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate), or as a tax
deduction.

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income.(1)

Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund.(1)

In January 2006, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2005. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2005 individual income
tax returns.

(1)   Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in
      the 10% and 15% income tax brackets). In determining the amount of foreign
      tax credit that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of
      individuals receiving foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may
      be required to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation to reflect
      the rate differential applicable to such dividend income. The rules
      however permit certain individuals to elect not to apply the rate
      differential adjustments for capital gains and/or dividends for any
      taxable year. Please consult your tax advisor and the instructions to Form
      1116 for more information.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has  delegated  the authority to vote proxies
related  to the  portfolio  securities  held by the Fund to the  Fund's  manager
Templeton Asset  Management Ltd in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in  analyzing  proxies,  the manager  subscribes  to  Institutional
Shareholder  Services (ISS), an  unaffiliated  third party corporate  governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote  recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third  party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses  and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  ISS'  and/or  Glass  Lewis'  analyses  are  thoroughly   reviewed  and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations   from  ISS,  Glass  Lewis  or  any  other  third  party  to  be
determinative  of the  manager's  ultimate  decision.  The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers,  directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose  interests  conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders.  All conflicts are resolved
in the  interests of the  manager's  clients.  In  situations  where the manager
perceives  a material  conflict  of  interest,  the manager  may:  disclose  the
conflict to the Fund's board of directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of directors,  ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services;  or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF  AUDITORS  OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  In light of several  high
profile  accounting  scandals,  the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance  of  auditors.  On a  case-by-case  basis,  the manager will examine
proposals  relating to non-audit  relationships  and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis,  proposals to rotate auditors,  and
will  vote  against  the  ratification  of  auditors  when  there is  clear  and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders'  long-term interests.  The manager
evaluates  plans on a  case-by-case  basis by  considering  several  factors  to
determine   whether  the  plan  is  fair  and  reasonable,   including  the  ISS
quantitative  model  utilized  to assess  such  plans  and/or  the  Glass  Lewis
evaluation of the plans.  The manager will generally  oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively  dilutive,  and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater  options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support  employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

</TABLE>

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual managers listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance-based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures helps to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
manager's focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. The separate management of the trade execution and
valuation functions from the portfolio management process also helps to reduce
potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected for funds or
accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected for the
Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics, which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         a Franklin Templeton fund which vest over a three-year period (17.5% to
         25%) and other mutual fund shares (17.5% to 25%). The deferred
         equity-based compensation is intended to build a vested interest of the
         portfolio manager in the financial performance of both Franklin
         Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The bonus plan is
         intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation
         that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving consistently strong
         investment performance, which aligns the financial incentives of the
         portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief Investment Officer
         of the manager and/or other officers of the manager, with
         responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of annual
         bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin Templeton
         guidelines. The following factors are generally used in determining
         bonuses under the plan:

         o    INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to
              the historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding
              years of all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The
              pre-tax performance of each fund managed is measured relative to a
              relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         o    NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative contributions
              of a portfolio manager to the manager's business and the
              investment management team, including business knowledge,
              contribution to team efforts, mentoring of junior staff, and
              contribution to the marketing of the Fund, are evaluated in
              determining the amount of any bonus award.

         o    RESEARCH. Where the portfolio management team also has research
              responsibilities, each portfolio manager is evaluated on
              the number and performance of recommendations over time.

         o    RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of funds
              managed by the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's
              appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds,
         and options to purchase common shares of a Franklin Templeton fund.
         Awards of such deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over
         time, so as to create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager as of December 31, 2005 (such amounts may change from
time to time):

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the

Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered

relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
