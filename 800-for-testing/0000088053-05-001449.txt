SUMMARY OF GENERAL INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FUND

The Central  Europe and Russia  Fund,  Inc.  (the  "Fund") is a  nondiversified,
actively-managed  Closed-End Fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the
symbol "CEE." The Fund seeks long term capital  appreciation  primarily  through

Central  Europe  and  Russia.   It  is  managed  and  advised  by   wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Deutsche Bank Group.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

Prices for the Fund's shares are published  daily in the New York Stock Exchange
Composite  Transactions section of newspapers.  Net asset value and market price
information  are  published  each Monday in The Wall Street  Journal and The New
York Times, and each Saturday in Barron's and other newspapers in a table called
"Closed End Funds." Daily information on the Fund's net asset value is available

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three  Closed-End  Funds  investing  in European  equities  managed by
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Deutsche Bank Group:

o    The  European   Equity  Fund,   Inc.--investing   primarily  in  equity  or
     equity-linked  securities of companies domiciled in European countries that
     utilize the Euro currency.

o    The New Germany Fund, Inc.--investing primarily in the middle market German
     companies and up to 20% elsewhere in Western  Europe (with no more than 10%
     in any single country).

o    The Central  Europe and Russia Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in Central
     European and Russian companies.

Please consult your broker for advice on any of the above or call 1-800-GERMANY
(in the U.S.) or 617-443-6918 (outside of the U.S.) for shareholder reports.

These  funds  are  not  diversified  and  focus  their  investments  in  certain
geographical regions,  thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in
those regions. Investing in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments,  such as currency  fluctuation,  political
and economic changes, and market risks such as increased share price volatility,
limited liquidity and lack of industry diversification.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               November 29, 2005

Dear Shareholder,

     We are pleased to report that for the fiscal year ended  October 31,  2005,
The Central  Europe and Russia Fund  increased  its net asset value per share by
48.74% in US dollar  terms,  while its share  price rose by  80.71%.  The Fund's
benchmark^1  rose 37.81% during the same period.  Overall,  the Central European
and Russian region outperformed  developed markets again this year: for the same
period,  the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index rose 6.8%, and the Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) Europe Index rose 21.5% in US dollar terms.

     Over the past  year,  The  Central  Europe and Russia  Fund  increased  its
exposure to Russian equities,  which had  underperformed in 2004. In part due to
its heavy weighting in the energy sector, the Russian market recovered this year
as oil prices  reached  an  all-time  high.  Within  the  energy  sector,  stock
selection  was a key factor in  performance.  In  particular,  the Fund's strong
overweight position in Transneft helped performance,  and its cautious stance on
underperforming   stocks   Mosenergo  and   Surgutneftegas   further   bolstered
performance.   One  of  the  sectors  in  which  performance  has  not  met  our
expectations is telecoms.  The Fund's position in MTS detracted from performance
this year.  The Fund  continues to diversify its holdings in Russia by adding to
its  positions  in  consumerrelated   stocks,   which  we  believe  will  be  an
increasingly important sector in Russia. We believe that the Russian market will
continue  to be driven by oil  prices,  but also  growing  consumer  demand  and
prospects  in the  banking  sector will be key themes.  Finally,  politics  will
continue to be an important factor ahead of the 2008 presidential elections.

     Throughout the year, one of the Fund's key themes was the banking sector in
Turkey.  Financial  companies  Finansbank,  Denizbank,  Garanti  Bank and Isbank
(along with several other banks) were among the top 10 performers in the Turkish
market during the period under review. The Fund's  significant  position in each
of these companies contributed positively to performance. However, as in Russia,
the Fund's  exposure to the telecom sector in Turkey did not pay off. The Fund's
position in Turkcell detracted from performance, as the share price was hindered
by  ownership  issues.  We  continue  to take a  positive  stance on  investment
opportunities  in Turkey,  based on our belief  that the  economic  outlook  and
earnings prospects appear favorable,  aided by falling finance costs and growing
consumer  demand.  With loans and mortgages  showing strong growth,  the banking
industry  continues  to be  the  prime  beneficiary  of the  improving  economic
environment.  Furthermore,  banks can benefit  from falling  interest  rates and
forthcoming legislation,  aimed at increasing access to mortgages for the middle
class.

     After its strong  performance last year, the Central Europe and Russia Fund
moved to a more cautious stance on the CE-3 region this year. In particular, the
Fund shifted  some focus away from the Polish  market  during the fiscal  fourth
quarter,  which  ended  October  31,  2005.  Nonetheless,  one of the  strongest
contributions  to  performance  during the year came from the Polish real estate
company Echo  Investments.  While the CE-3 markets  continued to perform well in
2005, we believe that the risk of profit taking  remains,  especially  given the
rich valuations in some markets.  (CE-3 refers to Czech Republic,  Hungary,  and
Poland).

     The Central  Europe and Russia Fund's  discount to net asset value averaged
7.5% during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005,  compared with 12.6% for the
same period last year.

Special Considerations

     The  observations  in this letter reflect our own opinions and are based on
our own  analysis,  and  others  may have  different  opinions.  Events  may not
transpire  as we or they  currently  expect.  Also,  while  economic  events can
influence  broad market trends,  political,  monetary and other factors are also
relevant to stock performance.  In any event,  investment results will depend on
our success in  identifying  individual  stocks,  which are  influenced  by many
factors beyond general economic matters. We cannot predict investment results or
whether they will be successful.

   Sincerely,

   /s/Christian Strenger              /s/Vincent J. Esposito

Index returns assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Fund returns, do not
reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Investments in funds involve risks including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified and may focus its investments in certain
geographical regions, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in
that region. Investing in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic changes and market risks. This may result in greater share price
volatility.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of
which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict
whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Closed-end
funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time
public offering, and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the
open market through a stock exchange.

The Fund will seek to comply with the German tax transparency rules for the
fiscal year that ends on October 31, 2005 and therefore qualify as a transparent
fund within the meaning of the German fund tax law (InvStG 2004).

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  Over the past  three  years the Fund and its  benchmark  have  posted
annual NAV returns in excess of 30%. What factors have contributed to the recent
strong performance of the Fund and emerging markets in general?

Answer: We are obviously pleased that the Fund has provided  investors with such
positive  returns.  Our stock  selection  process was a key factor in the Fund's
performance.  Emerging  market  equities have performed well in the past several
years,  despite  challenges  along  the way,  indicative  of the  volatility  of
emerging  markets.  The generally  strong  performance  has been the result of a
variety of factors,  including the global growth  environment,  global  emerging
markets sentiment,  equity valuations and, more recently,  commodity prices. For
many  Eastern  European  countries,  EU  membership  also  played  a part in the
performance  of the equity  markets.  With growth rates  exceeding the developed
markets,   emerging  markets  became  an  increasingly   attractive   investment
destination.  It should be noted that the higher  returns in these  markets also
reflect the higher risk associated with them, such as those involving political,
economic,  currency and regulatory  matters.  Other factors supported  continued
investment in emerging markets: For example, structural improvements in emerging
markets led to upgrades from the major ratings agencies for the region. In 2005,
the Fund's emphasis (50.5% at 10/31/05) on Russian  investments was also timely,
because Russia  benefited from increases in commodity  prices,  particularly for
energy.  While mindful of the continuing risks, we remain cautiously  optimistic
about the markets in Eastern Europe and Russia.

Question: One of the Fund's holdings is Gazprom.  Recently, there has been a lot
of speculation  regarding the removal of Gazprom's  so-called  ring fence.  What
does this mean, and what is its significance for investors?

Answer:  The Gazprom "ring fence" refers to restrictions on foreign ownership of
the  company.  The Russian  Duma,  or lower house of  parliament,  is  currently
reviewing  legislation to remove this so-called ring fence.  It is expected that
this process  will be  completed  by the end of 2005 or early 2006.  The primary
significance  of this  action is that it will  increase  Gazprom's  free  float,
thereby  increasing  its  weighting in the MSCI Emerging  Markets Free Index,  a
major  benchmark for  institutional  investors.  This should generate demand for
shares of Gazprom (or substitute  Russian  equities) as investors seek to reduce
the  underweight  positions  caused by the  changes  to the  index,  in order to
neutralize their exposure to Russian equities.

Question:   Poland  recently  elected  a  new  government.   What  are  the  new
government's  priorities?  Will the  investment  climate  change  under  the new
government?

Answer:  Ahead of this fall's parliamentary and presidential  elections,  Polish
equities  rallied on hopes that the elections  would bring a new government with
an  aggressive  reform  program.  The  elections  turned  out to be closer  than
expected, with the more market-friendly Civic Platform party coming in second to
the Law and Justice party. In addition, hopes for a coalition government between
the two  parties  failed  to  materialize.  Although  the final  outcome  of the
elections is less  positive  than  investors  had hoped,  we expect that the new
government may undertake  more-aggressive  reforms than the outgoing government.
The new  government has stated its intention to contain the budget deficit to 3%
of gross  domestic  product (GDP) and increase  economic  growth by 5% next year
through  increased  investment  and better  use of  European  Union (EU)  funds.
However, the new government plans to delay the euro adoption,  and privatization
of several key  companies is less likely to occur under the Law and  Justice-led
government  than  would  have  occurred  under  a  Civic  Platform   government.
Nonetheless,  Prime Minister  Marcinkiewicz has stated that the new government's
priorities  include   implementation  of   businessfriendly   measures  such  as
simplifying  procedures for starting new  businesses,  targeting  corruption and
improving efficiency in the courts.

Question:  Now that Turkey has begun  negotiations  with the EU, will the equity
market in Turkey be driven by external  factors such as  developments in the EU,
or are internal factors more important?

Answer:  Negotiations  between  Turkey and the EU are expected to continue for a
decade,  and it is  likely  that  there  will be some  areas of  dispute  as the
negotiations progress.  Given that support in Turkey for EU membership has waned
recently  and  that  there  has been  some  discussion  of the  EU's  ultimately
extending an offer for a "privileged partnership" in lieu of full membership, we
believe  there is some scope for  continued  volatility  in the  Turkish  market
related to the EU  accession  process.  However,  we also  believe  that  recent
reforms have  enhanced  Turkey's  fundamental  attractiveness  as an  investment
destination.  In addition to macroeconomic  reforms,  the Turkish government has
progressed with its privatization  program, and foreign direct investment nearly
doubled in the first  three  quarters of 2005  compared  with the same period in
2004.  The  Turkish  banking  sector,  in  particular,  has  benefited  from the
improving  economic  environment,  falling interest rates and a budding mortgage
market. As a result, we expect consumer demand,  foreign  investment and further
development  of the  financial  sector to be key drivers of the  Turkish  equity
market.

THE CENTRAL EUROPE AND RUSSIA FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--OCTOBER 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The  Central  Europe and Russia  Fund,  Inc.  is a  non-diversified,  closed-end
management  investment  company  incorporated  in Maryland.  The Fund  commenced
investment operations on March 6, 1990.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Security  Valuation:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

Securities  Transactions  and Investment  Income:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

Securities Lending: The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions.  The
Fund retains beneficial  ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues
to receive  interest and dividends  paid by the securities and to participate in
any changes in their  market  value.  The Fund  requires  the  borrowers  of the
securities  to  maintain   collateral   with  the  Fund  consisting  of  liquid,
unencumbered assets having a value at least equal to or greater than the "Margin
Percentage" of the value of the securities  loaned.  "Margin  Percentage"  shall
mean (i) for collateral  which is denominated in the same currency as the loaned
securities,  102%,  and (ii) for  collateral  which is denominated in a currency
different from that of the loaned securities, 105%. The Fund may invest the cash
collateral  into a joint  trading  account in an  affiliated  money  market fund
pursuant to Exemptive  Orders issued by the SEC. The Fund receives  compensation
for lending its securities  either in the form of fees or by earning interest on
invested cash collateral net of fees paid to a lending agent. Either the Fund or
the borrower may terminate the loan. The Fund is subject to all investment risks
associated with the value of any cash collateral  received,  including,  but not
limited to,  interest  rate,  credit and  liquidity  risk  associated  with such
investments.

Foreign Currency  Translation:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and  liabilities  denominated  in euros and other  foreign  currency  are
translated into United States dollars at the 11:00 A.M.  mid-point of the buying
and selling spot rates quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Purchases
and sales of investment securities, income and expenses are reported at the rate
of  exchange  prevailing  on the  respective  dates  of such  transactions.  The
resultant  gains  and  losses  arising  from  exchange  rate   fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable to  investments,  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Contingencies:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts with service providers that contain general  indemnification  clauses.
The Fund's maximum  exposure under these  arrangements  is unknown as this would
involve  future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund  that  have not yet
occurred.  However, based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be
remote.

Taxes:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code   applicable   to  regulated   investment   companies   and  to  distribute
substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders.

Dividends and  Distributions  to  Shareholders:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America. These

differences,  which could be temporary  or  permanent  in nature,  may result in
reclassification of distributions;  however, net investment income, net realized
gains and net assets are not affected.

At  October  31,  2005,  the  Fund's   components  of   distributable   earnings
(accumulated losses) on a tax-basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income* ................$  5,533,934

tax differences as follows:

Inc.  (the  "Manager.")  The  Fund has an  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  with
Deutsche Asset Management  International  GmbH (the  "Investment  Adviser.") The
Manager and the Investment Adviser are affiliated companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $100  million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $100  million.
The Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides the Investment Adviser with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100 million.  Accordingly,  for the period ended  October 31, 2005,  the fee
pursuant to the Management and Investment  Advisory Agreements was equivalent to
an annual effective rate of .86% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser,  in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objective,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders to select brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf
of the Fund.

NOTE 3.TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investment securities,  other than shortterm investments,
for the  year  ended  October  31,  2005  were  $106,076,536  and  $105,706,792,
respectively.

The Fund utilized $3,492,000 of prior year capital loss carryforwards.

NOTE 5. INVESTING IN FOREIGN MARKETS

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the

      at the closing  market  price per share on the last day of the year.  The  computation  does not reflect any

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc.

     In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  statement  of assets and  liabilities,
including the schedule of investments,  and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Central Europe and Russia Fund,
Inc.  (the "Fund") at October 31, 2005,  the results of its  operations  for the
year then ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the
period then ended, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and  financial
highlights   (hereafter   referred  to  as  "financial   statements")   are  the
responsibility  of the Fund's  management;  our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  financial  statements in  accordance  with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at October  31,  2005 by  correspondence  with the
custodian provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Fund offers shareholders a Voluntary Cash Purchase Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  A more complete  description of the Plan is provided in
the Plan brochure available from Investors Bank & Trust Company,  the plan agent
(the "Plan Agent"),  Shareholder Services, P. O. Box 9130, Boston, Massachusetts
02117 (telephone  1-800-437-6269).  A shareholder  should read the Plan brochure
carefully before enrolling in the Plan.

     Under the Plan,  participating  shareholders ("Plan Participants")  appoint
the Plan Agent to receive or invest Fund  distributions as described below under
"Reinvestment of Fund Shares." In addition,  Plan Participants may make optional
cash  purchases  through  the Plan  Agent as often as once a month as  described
below under "Voluntary Cash Purchases."  There is no charge to Plan Participants
for participating in the Plan, although when shares are purchased under the Plan
by the Plan  Agent on the New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  otherwise  on the open
market, each Plan Participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred  in  connection   with  such   purchases,   as  described  below  under
"Reinvestment of Fund Shares" and "Voluntary Cash Purchases."

Reinvestment of Fund Shares. Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains
distribution, an income dividend or a return of capital distribution payable, at
the election of shareholders, either in cash or in Fund shares, or payable only
in cash, the Plan Agent shall automatically elect to receive Fund shares for the
account of each Plan Participant.

     Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains distribution, an income dividend
or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value
per share of the Fund's common stock equals or is less than the market price per
share on the valuation  date (the "Market  Parity or  Premium"),  the Plan Agent
shall  apply the  amount of such  dividend  or  distribution  payable  to a Plan
Participant   to  the  purchase  from  the  Fund  of  Fund  Shares  for  a  Plan
Participant's  account,  except that if the Fund does not offer  shares for such
purpose because it concludes  Securities Act registration  would be required and
such registration cannot be timely effected or is not otherwise a cost-effective
alternative  for the  Fund,  then the Plan  Agent  shall  follow  the  procedure
described in the next paragraph.  The number of additional shares to be credited
to a Plan  Participant's  account  shall be  determined  by dividing  the dollar
amount of the distribution  payable to a Plan Participant by the net asset value
per share of the Fund's common stock on the valuation  date, or if the net asset
value  per share is less than 95% of the  market  price per share on such  date,
then by 95% of the  market  price  per  share.  The  valuation  date will be the
payable date for such dividend or distribution.

     Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains distribution, an income dividend
or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value
per share of the Fund's  common stock  exceeds the market price per share on the
valuation date (the "Market Discount"), the Plan Agent shall apply the amount of
such  dividend  or  distribution  payable  to a Plan  Participant  (less  a Plan
Participant's pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred with respect to
open-market  purchases in connection  with the  reinvestment of such dividend or
distribution)  to the  purchase  on the open  market of Fund  shares  for a Plan
Participant's  account.  The  valuation  date will be the payable  date for such
dividend or  distribution.  Such  purchases will be made on or shortly after the
valuation  date and in no event more than 30 days after such date  except  where
temporary  curtailment  or  suspension  of purchase is  necessary to comply with
applicable provisions of federal securities laws.

     The Plan  Agent  may  aggregate  a Plan  Participant's  purchases  with the
purchases of other Plan Participants, and the average price (including brokerage
commissions)  of all shares  purchased  by the Plan Agent shall be the price per
share allocable to each Plan Participant.

     For all purposes of the Plan,  the market price of the Fund's  common stock
on a payable  date shall be the last sales price on the New York Stock  Exchange
on that date,  or, if there is no sale on such Exchange  (or, if different,  the
principal  exchange  for Fund  shares) on that date,  then the mean  between the
closing bid and asked  quotations  for such stock on such Exchange on such date.
The net asset value per share of the Fund's  common  stock on a  valuation  date
shall be as determined by or on behalf of the Fund.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(unaudited)(continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Plan Agent may hold a Plan  Participant's  shares acquired  pursuant to
the Plan, together with the shares of other Plan Participants  acquired pursuant
to this Plan, in non-certificated  form in the name of the Plan Agent or that of
a  nominee.  The Plan  Agent will  forward  to each Plan  Participant  any proxy
solicitation  material  and will vote any shares so held for a Plan  Participant
only in accordance  with the proxy  returned by a Plan  Participant to the Fund.
Upon a Plan Participant's written request, the Plan Agent will deliver to a Plan
Participant,  without charge,  a certificate or certificates for the full shares
held by the Plan Agent.

Voluntary  Cash  Purchases.   Plan   Participants  have  the  option  of  making
investments in Fund shares through the Plan Agent as often as once a month. Plan
Participants  may  invest as  little  as $100 in any month and may  invest up to
$36,000 annually through the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan.

     The Plan Agent shall apply such funds (less a Plan  Participant's  pro rata
share of brokerage  commissions  or other costs,  if any) to the purchase on the
New York Stock  Exchange (or, if different,  on the principal  exchange for Fund
shares)  or  otherwise  on  the  open  market  of  Fund  shares  for  such  Plan
Participant's account, regardless of whether there is a Market Parity or Premium
or a Market Discount.  The Plan Agent will purchase shares for Plan Participants
on or about the 15th of each  month.  Cash  payments  received by the Plan Agent
less than five business days prior to a cash  purchase  investment  date will be
held by the Plan Agent until the next month's investment date.  Uninvested funds
will not bear  interest.  Plan  Participants  may  withdraw any  voluntary  cash
payment  by  written  notice  received  by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours
before such payment is to be invested.

Enrollment and Withdrawal. Both current shareholders and first-time investors in
the Fund are eligible to participate in the Plan.  Current  shareholders my join
the Plan by either  enrolling  their  shares with the Plan Agent or by making an
initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Plan Agent.  First-time investors
in the Fund may join the Plan by making an initial cash deposit of at least $250
with the Plan Agent. In order to become a Plan  Participant,  shareholders  must
complete and sign the  enrollment  form included in the Plan brochure and return
it, and, if applicable, an initial cash deposit of at least $250 directly to the
Plan Agent if shares are  registered in their name.  Shareholders  who hold Fund
shares in the name of a brokerage  firm,  bank or other nominee  should  contact
such nominee to arrange for it to participate in the Plan on such  shareholder's
behalf.

     If the Plan  Participant  elects to  participate  in the Plan by  enrolling
current shares owned by the Plan Participant with the Plan Agent,  participation
in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan begins with the next dividend
or capital gains  distribution  payable  after the Plan Agent  receives the Plan
Participant's written authorization,  provided such authorization is received by
the Plan Agent prior to the record date for such  dividend or  distribution.  If
such  authorization  is received after such record date, the Plan  Participant's
participation in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan begins with the
following dividend or distribution.

     If the Plan  Participant  elects  to  participate  in the Plan by making an
initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Plan Agent,  participation in the
dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan  begins  with the next  dividend  or
capital  gains  distribution  payable  after the Plan  Agent  receives  the Plan
Participant's  authorization  and  deposit,  and after the Plan Agent  purchases
shares  for the  Plan  Participant  on the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  (or,  if
different,  on the principal  exchange for Fund shares) or otherwise on the open
market,  provided  that the  authorization  and  deposit are  received,  and the
purchases  are  made  by the  Plan  Agent  prior  to the  record  date.  If such
authorization  and deposit are received  after the record  date,  or if the Plan
Agent purchases shares for the Plan Participant  after the record date, the Plan
Participant's  participation  in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan
begins with the following dividend or distribution.

     A shareholder's  written authorization and cash payment must be received by
the Plan Agent at least five  business days in advance of the next cash purchase
investment  date  (normally  the 15th of  every  month)  in  order  for the Plan
Participant to participate in the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan in
that month.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(unaudited)(continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Plan  Participants  may withdraw  from the Plan  without  charge by written
notice to the Plan Agent.  Plan Participants who choose to withdraw may elect to
receive stock certificates  representing all of the full shares held by the Plan
Agent on their  behalf,  or to instruct  the Plan Agent to sell such full shares
and distribute the proceeds, net of brokerage  commissions,  to such withdrawing
Plan  Participant.  Withdrawing Plan Participants will receive a cash adjustment
for the market value of any  fractional  shares held on their behalf at the time
of  termination.  Withdrawal  will be  effective  immediately  with  respect  to
distributions  with a record  date not less than 10 days later  than  receipt of
such written notice by the Plan Agent.

Amendment and  Termination of Plan. The Plan may only be amended or supplemented
by the Fund or by the Plan Agent by giving each Plan Participant  written notice
at least 90 days prior to the effective  date of such  amendment or  supplement,
except that such notice period may be shortened when necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with  applicable  law or the rules or policies of the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory body.

     The Plan may be  terminated  by the  Fund or by the Plan  Agent by  written
notice mailed to each Plan Participant.  Such termination will be effective with
respect  to all  distributions  with a record  date at least 90 days  after  the
mailing of such written notice to the Plan Participants.

     Federal  Income  Tax   Implications   of   Reinvestment   of  Fund  Shares.
Reinvestment of Fund shares does not relieve Plan  Participants  from any income
tax which may be payable on dividends or distributions.  For U.S. federal income
tax purposes,  when the Fund issues shares  representing an income dividend or a
capital gains  dividend,  a  Participant  will include in income the fair market
value of the shares  received  as of the  payment  date,  which will be ordinary
dividend income or capital gains, as the case may be. The shares will have a tax
basis equal to such fair  market  value,  and the holding  period for the shares
will begin on the day after the date of distribution. If shares are purchased on
the open market by the Plan Agent, a Plan Participant will include in income the
amount of the cash payment  made.  The basis of such shares will be the purchase
price of the shares, and the holding period for the shares will begin on the day

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
APPROVAL
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund's  directors  unanimously  approved the  continuance  of the management
agreement between the Fund and Deutsche  Investment  Management  Americas,  Inc.
("DIMA") and the  investment  advisory  agreement  between the Fund and Deutsche
Asset Management International GmbH ("DeAMI") (together called the "agreements")
at a meeting held on July 17, 2005.

In  preparation  for the meeting,  the  directors  had  requested  and evaluated
extensive  materials  from DIMA and DeAMI,  including  performance  and  expense
information for other investment  companies with similar  investment  objectives
derived  from data  compiled by Lipper  Inc.  ("Lipper").  Prior to voting,  the
directors  reviewed the proposed  continuance of the agreements  with management
and with experienced  counsel who are independent of DIMA and DeAMI and received
a  memorandum  from  such  counsel  discussing  the  legal  standards  for their
consideration  of the proposed  continuance.  The directors  also  discussed the
proposed   continuance   in  a  private   session   with  counsel  at  which  no
representatives of DIMA or DeAMI were present.  In reaching their  determination
relating to continuance of the agreements,  the directors considered all factors
they believed relevant, including the following:

1. information  comparing the Fund's  performance to other investment  companies
with similar investment objectives and to an index;

2. the nature,  extent and quality of  investment  and  administrative  services
rendered  by DIMA and DeAMI;

3.  payments  received by DIMA and DeAMI from all sources in respect to the Fund
and all investment companies in the Deutsche/Scudder family of funds;

4. the costs borne by, and  profitability  of, DIMA and  Investment  Adviser and
their  affiliates  in  providing  services  to the  Fund  and to all  investment
companies in the Deutsche/Scudder family of funds;

5. comparative fee and expense data for the Fund and other investment  companies
with similar investment objectives;

6. the extent to which  economies  of scale  would be realized as the Fund grows
and  whether  fee levels  reflect  these  economies  of scale for the benefit of
investors;

7. DIMA's and DeAMI's policies and practices regarding  allocation of the Fund's
portfolio  transactions,  including the extent,  if any, to which DIMA and DeAMI
benefit from soft dollar arrangements;

8. the Fund's  portfolio  turnover rates  compared to those of other  investment
companies with similar investment objectives;

9. fall-out  benefits which DIMA, DeAMI and their affiliates  receive from their
relationships with the Fund;

10. the  professional  experience  and  qualifications  of the Fund's  portfolio
management team and other senior  personnel of DIMA and DeAMI; and

11. the terms of the agreements.

The directors also  considered  their knowledge of the nature and quality of the
services  provided by DIMA and DeAMI to the Fund gained from their experience as
directors of The European Equity Fund and, where relevant,  The New Germany Fund
and  other  Deutsche/Scudder  funds,  their  confidence  in DIMA's  and  DeAMI's
integrity  and  competence  gained from that  experience  and DIMA's and DeAMI's
responsiveness  to  concerns  raised by them in the past,  including  DIMA's and
DeAMI's  willingness to consider and implement  organizational  and  operational
changes designed to improve  investment results and the services provided to the
Fund.

In  their   deliberations,   the  directors  did  not  identify  any  particular
information that was all-important or controlling,  and each director attributed
different weights to the various factors.

The  directors  determined  that the overall  arrangements  between the Fund and
DIMA, as provided in the management  agreement,  and between the Fund and DeAMI,
as provided in the investment  advisory  agreement,  were fair and reasonable in
light of the services performed, expenses incurred and such other matters as the
directors considered relevant in the exercise of their reasonable judgment.

The material  factors and  conclusions  that formed the basis for the directors'
reaching  their  determination  to approve  the  continuance  of the  agreements
(including  their  determinations  that DIMA and DeAMI should  continue in those
roles for the Fund,  and that the fees payable to DIMA and DeAMI pursuant to the
agreements are appropriate) were separately discussed by the directors.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by DIMA and DeAMI

The  directors  noted that,  under the  management  agreement,  DIMA acts as our
corporate manager and administrator and, subject to the supervision of our board
of directors and pursuant to recommendations made by DeAMI,  determines suitable
securities for investment by the Fund. Under the investment  advisory agreement,
DeAMI,  in  accordance  with the  Fund's  investment  objectives,  policies  and
limitations,  makes  recommendations with respect to the Fund's investments and,
upon instructions given by DIMA as to



                                       26

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
APPROVAL (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders and selects brokers and dealers to execute portfolio  transactions on the
Fund's  behalf.  Under the  management  agreement,  DIMA also handles the Fund's
relationships with  shareholders,  is responsible for compliance with regulatory
and NYSE listing requirements,  negotiates arrangements with third party service
providers,  provides Fund directors with relevant  reports,  prepares the Fund's
tax returns and SEC and shareholder reports,  calculates dividends and net asset
value,  oversees payment of the Fund's expenses and maintains books and records.
DIMA also provides the Fund with such office  facilities and executive and other
personnel adequate to perform its services. DIMA pays all of the compensation of
our directors and officers who are interested persons of DIMA.

The directors  considered the scope and quality of services provided by DIMA and
DeAMI under the  agreements  and noted that the scope of services  provided  had
expanded  over  time as a result  of  regulatory  and  other  developments.  The
directors  noted that, for example,  DIMA is  responsible  for  maintaining  and
monitoring  its own and the Fund's  compliance  programs,  and these  compliance
programs  have  recently  been refined and  enhanced in light of new  regulatory
requirements.  The directors  considered the quality of the investment  research
capabilities  of DIMA and DeAMI and the other  resources  they have dedicated to
performing  services  for the Fund.  The  quality  of  administrative  and other
services,  including  DIMA's role in  coordinating  the activities of the Fund's
other service  providers,  also were considered.  The directors  concluded that,
overall,  they were  satisfied  with the nature,  extent and quality of services
provided (and expected to be provided) to the Fund under the agreements.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability to DIMA and
DeAMI

At  the  request  of  the  directors,   DIMA  provided  information   concerning
profitability  of  DIMA's  and  DeAMI's  respective   investment   advisory  and
investment company activities and their financial  condition based on historical
information for 2003 and 2004. The directors  reviewed with DIMA assumptions and
methods  of  allocation  used by DIMA  and  DeAMI  in  preparing  Fund  specific
profitability  data.  DIMA stated its belief that the methods of allocation used
were reasonable,  but it noted that there are limitations inherent in allocating
costs to multiple  individual advisory clients served by an organization such as
DIMA and DeAMI where each of the advisory  clients draws on, and benefits  from,
the  research  and  other  resources  of the  Deutsche  Bank  organization.  The
directors  recognized that it is difficult to make  comparisons of profitability
from fund management contracts because comparative  information is not generally
publicly available and is affected by numerous factors,  including the structure
of the  particular  adviser,  the types of funds it manages,  its business  mix,
numerous assumptions  regarding  allocations and the adviser's capital structure
and cost of capital.  In considering  profitability  information,  the directors
considered  the effect of  possible  fall-out  benefits,  on DIMA's and  DeAMI's
expenses, including any affiliated brokerage commissions.

The  directors  noted that during 2003 DIMA and DeAMI  revised their soft dollar
practices to discontinue using soft dollars to receive third party research from
brokers that execute  purchases and sales of securities  for us, and  formalized
this change in their  policies in 2004.  DIMA and DeAMI may continue to allocate
brokerage to receive  research  generated  by  executing  brokers and to receive
other information services. The directors also noted that in 2004 DIMA and DeAMI
revised  their  policies  to  prohibit  consideration  of the sale of  shares of
Deutsche/Scudder  funds when  selecting  broker  dealers  to  execute  portfolio
transactions for the Fund or other Deutsche/Scudder funds.

The directors  recognized that DIMA and DeAMI should,  in the abstract,  each be
entitled to earn a  reasonable  level of profits for the services it provides to
us and,  based on their  review,  concluded  that DIMA's and  DeAMI's  levels of
profitability from its relationship with the Fund were not excessive.

Investment Results

In addition to the  information  received by the directors for the meeting,  the
directors receive detailed performance  information for the Fund at each regular
board meeting during the year. The directors  reviewed  information  showing the
Fund's performance  compared to that of other European Closed End Funds compiled
by Lipper,  plus three other equity oriented closed end country funds managed by
affiliates of DIMA and DeAMI (a total of 12 funds,  including us). The directors
also reviewed  information  showing  performance of the Fund's  benchmark index,
currently a blend of 45% CECE index of 26 Central European stocks, 45% RTX index
of 8 Russian stocks and 10% ISE 30 index of 30 Turkish stocks.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT APPROVAL

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The comparative  information showed that the Fund ranked in the top half for the
one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended March 31, 2005. The Fund's results
were  significantly  positive in absolute  terms,  and exceeded our benchmark in
2003 and  2004.  The  Fund  exceeded  its  benchmark  in two of the  five  years
1998-2002.  (Comparisons prior to 1998 are not meaningful because until then the
Fund had a purely German focus.) The Fund also exceeded its benchmark in each of
the first two quarters of 2005.  Taking into account these  comparisons  and the
other factors  considered,  including the excellent  performance  since the Fund
increased emphasis on Russian investments that began in mid-2003,  the directors
concluded that the Fund's investment results over time were satisfactory.

Management and Investment Advisory Fees and Other
Expenses

The directors  considered the management and investment  advisory fee rates paid
by us to DIMA and DeAMI.  The directors  recognized that it is difficult to make
comparisons  of management and advisory fees because there are variations in the
services  that are  included  in the fees paid by other  funds.  The Fund's peer
group  consisted  of  the  12  closed  end  country  funds  described  above  in
"Investment  Results." The information  showed that the Fund's current effective
management fee rate of 0.884% was the lowest in the peer group and significantly
below the average and the median for the peer group.  The  directors  noted that
the Fund's effective fee rate reflects the effect of breakpoints.

The directors  also  considered  the Fund's total expense ratio in comparison to
the fees and expenses of funds within its peer group.  The directors  recognized
that the expense ratio information for the Fund potentially  reflected on DIMA's
provision of services, as DIMA is responsible for coordinating services provided
to the Fund by others.

The directors  also noted that the Fund's  expense ratio was the third lowest of
the peer group.  DIMA explained that this  difference was principally the result
of our relatively  low  management  and  investment  advisory fee and the Fund's
relatively  large asset base.  The directors  concluded  that the Fund's expense
ratio was highly satisfactory.

Economies of Scale

The  directors  noted that the Fund's  management  fee and  investment  advisory
schedules  do  contain  breakpoints  that  reduce  the fee rate on assets  above
specified  levels.   The  directors   recognized  that  breakpoints  may  be  an
appropriate  way for DIMA and DeAMI to share their  economies of scale with some
funds that have  substantial  assets or that may grow  materially  over the next
year. However, they also recognized that there is no direct relationship between
the economies of scale realized by funds and those realized by DIMA and DeAMI as
assets increase,  largely because economies of scale are realized (if at all) by
DIMA and DeAMI  across a  variety  of  products  and  services,  and not only in
respect of a single fund. Having taken these factors into account, the directors
concluded that the Fund's  breakpoint  arrangements  were  acceptable  under the
Fund's circumstances.

The Fund offers  shareholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend

additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the

ITEM 2.         CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period, October 31, 2005, Central Europe and Russia Fund,
Inc. has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR, that
applies to its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer.

There have been no amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of the code of
ethics during the period covered by this report that would require disclosure
under Item 2.

A copy of the code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-CSR.


ITEM 3.         AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.


The Fund's Board of Directors has determined that the Fund has at least one
"audit committee financial expert" serving on its audit committee: Mr. Robert H
Wadsworth and John H. Cannon. Each of these audit committee members is
"independent," meaning that he is not an "interested person" of the Fund (as
that term is defined in Section 2(a) (19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940)
and he does not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from
the Fund (except in the capacity as a Board or committee member).

An "audit committee financial expert" is not an "expert" for any purpose,
including for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result
of being designated as an "audit committee financial expert." Further, the
designation of a person as an "audit committee financial expert" does not mean
that the person has any greater duties, obligations, or liability that those
imposed on the person without the "audit committee financial expert"
designation. Similarly, the designation of a person as an "audit committee
financial expert" does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any
other member of the audit committee of board of directors.

ITEM 4.         PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

The following table shows the amount of fees that PWC billed during the Fund's
last two fiscal years for non-audit services. For engagements entered into on or
after May 6, 2003, the Audit Committee pre-approved all non-audit services that
PWC provided to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider that
related directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting. The Audit
Committee requested and received information from PWC about any non-audit
services that PWC rendered during the Fund's last fiscal year to the Adviser and
any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The Committee considered this information
in evaluating PWC's independence.

ITEM 6.         SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

                Not Applicable

ITEM 7.         DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
                CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

The Fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to its investment advisor,
subject to the Board's general oversight. The Fund has delegated proxy voting to
the advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted consistent with the


<PAGE>


Fund's best economic interests. The advisor has adopted its own Proxy Voting
Policies and Procedures ("Policies"), and Proxy Voting Guidelines ("Guidelines")
for this purpose. The Policies address, among other things, conflicts of
interest that may arise between the interests of the Fund, and the interests of
the advisor and its affiliates, including the Fund's principal underwriter. The
Guidelines set forth the advisor's general position on various proposals, such
as:

         o  Shareholder Rights -- The advisor generally votes against proposals
            that restrict shareholder rights.

         o  Corporate Governance -- The advisor generally votes for confidential
            and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements
            for charter and bylaw amendments.

         o  Anti-Takeover Matters -- The advisor generally votes for proposals
            that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that
            request boards to redeem poison pills, and votes "against" the
            adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder
            ratification. The advisor generally votes for fair price proposals.

         o  Routine Matters -- The advisor generally votes for the ratification
            of auditors, procedural matters related to the annual meeting, and
            changes in company name, and against bundled proposals and
            adjournment.

The general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies. The
advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance
with the recommendations of an independent third-party, except for proxies
solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an
affiliate serves as investment advisor or principal underwriter ("affiliated
investment companies"). The advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies
in the same proportion as the vote of the investment company's other
shareholders (sometimes called "mirror" or "echo" voting). Master fund proxies
solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Although the Guidelines set forth the advisor's general voting positions on
various proposals, the advisor may, consistent with the Fund's best interests,
determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions.

The Guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of
individual members of the board, or of a majority of the board. In addition, the
Guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices
of the public companies within the Deutsche Bank organization or of the
investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment
advisor or sponsor.

The advisor may consider the views of a portfolio company's management in
deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the
Guidelines, but management's views are not determinative.

As mentioned above, the Policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves
conflicts of interest. To resolve conflicts, the advisor, under normal
circumstances, votes proxies in accordance with its Guidelines. If the advisor
departs from the Guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the
Guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal, a proxy voting
committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy. Before voting any such
proxy, however, the advisor's conflicts review committee will conduct an
investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in
connection with the particular proxy proposal. If the conflicts review committee
determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest, or certain
individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating
in a particular proxy vote, it will inform the proxy voting committee. If
notified that the advisor has a material conflict, or fewer than three voting
members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote, typically the advisor
will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy
voting recommendations of an independent third party. Under certain
circumstances, the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may
find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits
associated with voting. For example, the advisor may not vote


<PAGE>


proxies on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs. The
advisor generally does not vote proxies on securities subject to share blocking
restrictions.

I.       Overview

This Principal  Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Code of Ethics
("Officer Code") sets forth the policies,  practices,  and values expected to be
exhibited  in the conduct of the  Principal  Executive  Officers  and  Principal
Financial  Officers of the investment  companies  ("Funds") they serve ("Covered
Officers"). A list of Covered Officers and Funds is included on Appendix A.

The Boards of the Funds  listed on  Appendix A have  elected  to  implement  the
Officer Code,  pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
SEC's rules thereunder, to promote and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct in
their Covered Officers.

Deutsche  Asset  Management,  Inc.  or its  affiliates  ("DeAM")  serves  as the
investment adviser to each Fund. All Covered Officers are also employees of DeAM
or an  affiliate.  Thus,  in addition to  adhering  to the Officer  Code,  these
individuals must comply with DeAM policies and procedures, such as the DeAM Code
of Ethics  governing  personal trading  activities,  as adopted pursuant to Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.(1) In addition, such individuals
also must comply with other applicable Fund policies and procedures.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer,  who shall not be a Covered Officer and who shall
serve  as such  subject  to the  approval  of the  Fund's  Board  (or  committee
thereof), is primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing this Code. The
Compliance  Officer has the  authority  to  interpret  this Officer Code and its
applicability to particular circumstances.  Any questions about the Officer Code
should be directed to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

The DeAM Compliance  Officer and his or her contact  information can be found in
Appendix A.

II.      Purposes of the Officer Code

The purposes of the Officer Code are to deter wrongdoing and to:

o        promote honest and ethical  conduct among Covered  Officers,  including
         the  ethical  handling  of actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest
         between personal and professional relationships;

o        promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable  disclosures in
         reports  and  documents  that the Funds  file with or submit to the SEC
         (and in other public communications from the Funds) and that are within
         the Covered Officer's responsibilities;

o        promote compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;

o        encourage  the prompt  internal  reporting of violations of the Officer
         Code to the DeAM Compliance Officer; and

o        establish accountability for adherence to the Officer Code.

Any  questions  about the Officer  Code should be referred to DeAM's  Compliance
Officer.


- --------

(1) The  obligations  imposed by the  Officer  Code are  separate  from,  and in
addition to, any obligations  imposed under codes of ethics adopted  pursuant to
Rule  17j-1  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  and any other code of
conduct  applicable to Covered  Officers in whatever  capacity  they serve.  The
Officer  Code does not  incorporate  any of those other codes and,  accordingly,
violations of those codes will not  necessarily be considered  violations of the
Officer Code and waivers granted under those codes would not necessarily require
a waiver to be granted under this Code.  Sanctions imposed under those codes may
be considered  in  determining  appropriate  sanctions for any violation of this
Code.

III.     Responsibilities of Covered Officers

A.       Honest and Ethical Conduct

It is the duty of every Covered Officer to encourage and demonstrate  honest and
ethical conduct,  as well as adhere to and require adherence to the Officer Code
and any other  applicable  policies  and  procedures  designed  to promote  this
behavior.  Covered Officers must at all times conduct  themselves with integrity
and distinction,  putting first the interests of the Fund(s) they serve. Covered
Officers  must  be  honest  and  candid  while  maintaining  confidentiality  of
information where required by law, DeAM policy or Fund policy.

Covered  Officers also must, at all times,  act in good faith,  responsibly  and
with due  care,  competence  and  diligence,  without  misrepresenting  or being
misleading  about material facts or allowing  their  independent  judgment to be
subordinated.  Covered  Officers also should  maintain  skills  appropriate  and
necessary for the performance of their duties for the Fund(s).  Covered Officers
also must responsibly use and control all Fund assets and resources entrusted to
them.

Covered Officers may not retaliate  against others for, or otherwise  discourage
the  reporting  of,  actual  or  apparent  violations  of the  Officer  Code  or
applicable  laws or regulations.  Covered  Officers should create an environment
that encourages the exchange of information, including concerns of the type that
this Code is designed to address.

B.       Conflicts of Interest

A "conflict  of interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's  personal  interests
interfere  with  the  interests  of the Fund for  which he or she  serves  as an
officer.  Covered Officers may not improperly use their position with a Fund for
personal or private  gain to  themselves,  their  family,  or any other  person.
Similarly,  Covered  Officers may not use their  personal  influence or personal
relationships  to  influence  decisions  or other Fund  business or  operational
matters  where they would  benefit  personally  at the Fund's  expense or to the
Fund's  detriment.  Covered  Officers may not cause the Fund to take action,  or
refrain from taking action,  for their personal benefit at the Fund's expense or
to the Fund's detriment.  Some examples of conflicts of interest follow (this is
not an all-inclusive  list): being in the position of supervising,  reviewing or
having any  influence  on the job  evaluation,  pay or benefit of any  immediate
family  member who is an employee  of a Fund  service  provider or is  otherwise
associated  with the Fund;  or having an  ownership  interest  in, or having any
consulting or employment relationship with, any Fund service provider other than
DeAM or its affiliates.

Certain   conflicts  of  interest   covered  by  this  Code  arise  out  of  the
relationships  between Covered Officers and the Fund that already are subject to
conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers  Act. For example,  Covered  Officers  may not  individually  engage in
certain  transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other
property) with the Fund because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" of the
Fund.  Covered  Officers  must  comply  with  applicable  laws and  regulations.
Therefore,  any violations of existing statutory and regulatory  prohibitions on
individual behavior could be considered a violation of this Code.

As to conflicts  arising from, or as a result of the advisory  relationship  (or
any  other  relationships)  between  the Fund and  DeAM,  of which  the  Covered
Officers are also  officers or  employees,  it is  recognized by the Board that,
subject to DeAM's fiduciary duties to the Fund, the Covered Officers will in the
normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for DeAM, or for
both) be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will
have different effects on


                                       4
<PAGE>

DeAM and the Fund. The Board  recognizes that the  participation  of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contract relationship between the
Fund and  DeAM,  and is  consistent  with the  expectation  of the  Board of the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund.

Covered Officers should avoid actual  conflicts of interest,  and appearances of
conflicts of interest,  between the Covered Officer's duties to the Fund and his
or her personal interests beyond those contemplated or anticipated by applicable
regulatory  schemes.  If a Covered Officer suspects or knows of a conflict or an
appearance of one, the Covered Officer must immediately report the matter to the
DeAM  Compliance  Officer.  If a Covered  Officer,  in lieu of reporting  such a
matter to the DeAM  Compliance  Officer,  may report the matter  directly to the
Fund's Board (or  committee  thereof),  as  appropriate  (e.g.,  if the conflict
involves the DeAM Compliance Officer or the Covered Officer reasonably  believes
it would be futile to report the matter to the DeAM Compliance Officer).

When actual,  apparent or suspected  conflicts of interest  arise in  connection
with a Covered  Officer,  DeAM  personnel  aware of the matter  should  promptly
contact the DeAM  Compliance  Officer.  There will be no reprisal or retaliation
against the person reporting the matter.

Upon receipt of a report of a possible  conflict,  the DeAM  Compliance  Officer
will take steps to determine  whether a conflict  exists.  In so doing, the DeAM
Compliance  Officer may take any actions he or she  determines to be appropriate
in his or her sole  discretion and may use all reasonable  resources,  including
retaining or engaging  legal  counsel,  accounting  firms or other  consultants,
subject to  applicable  law.(2) The costs  associated  with such  actions may be
borne by the Fund, if appropriate,  after consultation with the Fund's Board (or
committee  thereof).  Otherwise,  such  costs  will be  borne  by DeAM or  other
appropriate Fund service provider.

After  full  review of a report of a possible  conflict  of  interest,  the DeAM
Compliance Officer may determine that no conflict or reasonable  appearance of a
conflict exists.  If, however,  the DeAM Compliance  Officer  determines that an
actual conflict exists,  the Compliance Officer will resolve the conflict solely
in the interests of the Fund, and will report the conflict and its resolution to
the  Fund's  Board  (or  committee  thereof).  If the  DeAM  Compliance  Officer
determines that the appearance of a conflict exists, the DeAM Compliance Officer
will take appropriate  steps to remedy such  appearance.  In lieu of determining
whether a conflict  exists  and/or  resolving  a conflict,  the DeAM  Compliance
Officer instead may refer the matter to the Fund's Board (or committee thereof),
as appropriate.  However,  the DeAM Compliance  Officer must refer the matter to
the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof)  if the DeAM  Compliance  Officer is
directly involved in the conflict or under similar appropriate circumstances.

After  responding  to a report of a  possible  conflict  of  interest,  the DeAM
Compliance  Officer  will  discuss the matter with the person  reporting it (and
with the Covered Officer at issue, if different) for purposes of educating those
involved on conflicts of interests  (including  how to detect and avoid them, if
appropriate).

Appropriate  resolution of conflicts may restrict the personal activities of the
Covered Officer and/or his family, friends or other persons.

Solely because a conflict is disclosed to the DeAM  Compliance  Officer  (and/or
the Board or Committee  thereof) and/or resolved by the DeAM Compliance  Officer
does not mean that the conflict or its resolution  constitutes a waiver from the
Code's requirements.

(2) For  example,  retaining a Fund's  independent  accounting  firm may require
pre-approval by the Fund's audit committee.


                                       5
<PAGE>

Any  questions  about  conflicts of  interests,  including  whether a particular
situation might be a conflict or an appearance of one, should be directed to the
DeAM Compliance Officer.

C.       Use of Personal Fund Shareholder Information

A Covered  Officer  may not use or  disclose  personal  information  about  Fund
shareholders,  except in the performance of his or her duties for the Fund. Each
Covered Officer also must abide by the Funds' and DeAM's privacy  policies under
SEC Regulation S-P.

D.       Public Communications

In connection with his or her  responsibilities for or involvement with a Fund's
public  communications  and disclosure  documents  (e.g.,  shareholder  reports,
registration  statements,  press  releases),  each Covered  Officer must provide
information  to  Fund  service   providers  (within  the  DeAM  organization  or
otherwise)  and to the Fund's Board (and any  committees  thereof),  independent
auditors,  government regulators and self-regulatory organizations that is fair,
accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable.

Further,  within the scope of their duties,  Covered  Officers  having direct or
supervisory  authority  over Fund  disclosure  documents  or other  public  Fund
communications   will,   to  the  extent   appropriate   within  their  area  of
responsibility,   endeavor  to  ensure   full,   fair,   timely,   accurate  and
understandable  disclosure in Fund disclosure  documents.  Such Covered Officers
will  oversee,  or  appoint  others to  oversee,  processes  for the  timely and
accurate  creation  and review of all public  reports  and  regulatory  filings.
Within  the  scope of his or her  responsibilities  as a Covered  Officer,  each
Covered  Officer also will  familiarize  himself or herself with the  disclosure
requirements  applicable  to the Fund,  as well as the  business  and  financial
operations  of the Fund.  Each  Covered  Officer  also will  adhere to, and will
promote adherence to, applicable disclosure controls,  processes and procedures,
including DeAM's Disclosure Controls and Procedures, which govern the process by
which Fund disclosure documents are created and reviewed.

To the extent that  Covered  Officers  participate  in the  creation of a Fund's
books or records, they must do so in a way that promotes the accuracy,  fairness
and timeliness of those records.

E.       Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations

In  connection  with  his or her  duties  and  within  the  scope  of his or her
responsibilities  as a Covered  Officer,  each Covered  Officer must comply with
governmental  laws,  rules  and  regulations,  accounting  standards,  and  Fund
policies/procedures  that apply to his or her role,  responsibilities and duties
with respect to the Funds ("Applicable  Laws"). These requirements do not impose
on Covered Officers any additional  substantive  duties.  Additionally,  Covered
Officers should promote compliance with Applicable Laws.

If a Covered  Officer knows of any material  violations  of  Applicable  Laws or
suspects  that such a  violation  may have  occurred,  the  Covered  Officer  is
expected to promptly report the matter to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

IV.      Violation Reporting

A.       Overview

Each Covered Officer must promptly report to the DeAM  Compliance  Officer,  and
promote the reporting of, any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code.
Failure to report a violation may be a violation of the Officer Code.

Examples of violations of the Officer Code include,  but are not limited to, the
following:

o        Unethical or dishonest behavior
o        Obvious lack of adherence to policies  surrounding  review and approval
         of public communications and regulatory filings
o        Failure to report violations of the Officer Code
o        Known or obvious deviations from Applicable Laws
o        Failure to  acknowledge  and certify  adherence to the Officer Code

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer has the authority to take any and all action he or
she considers  appropriate in his or her sole discretion to investigate known or
suspected  Code  violations,  including  consulting  with the Fund's Board,  the
independent  Board members,  a Board committee,  the Fund's legal counsel and/or
counsel to the independent  Board members.  The Compliance  Officer also has the
authority to use all reasonable resources to investigate  violations,  including
retaining or engaging  legal  counsel,  accounting  firms or other  consultants,
subject to  applicable  law.(3) The costs  associated  with such  actions may be
borne by the Fund, if appropriate,  after consultation with the Fund's Board (or
committee thereof). Otherwise, such costs will be borne by DeAM.

B.       How to Report

Any known or suspected  violations of the Officer Code must be promptly reported
to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

C.       Process for Violation Reporting to the Fund Board

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will promptly report any violations of the Code to
the Fund's Board (or committee thereof).

D.       Sanctions for Code Violations

Violations  of the Code will be taken  seriously.  In  response  to  reported or
otherwise  known  violations,  DeAM and the  relevant  Fund's  Board may  impose
sanctions  within  the  scope of their  respective  authority  over the  Covered
Officer  at issue.  Sanctions  imposed  by DeAM  could  include  termination  of
employment.  Sanctions  imposed by a Fund's Board could include  termination  of
association with the Fund.

V.       Waivers from the Officer Code

A Covered  Officer may request a waiver from the Officer Code by  transmitting a
written request for a waiver to the DeAM Compliance Officer.(4) The request must
include the  rationale  for the request and must explain how the waiver would be
in furtherance of the standards of conduct described in and underlying  purposes
of the Officer Code. The DeAM Compliance Officer will present this information

- --------

(3) For  example,  retaining a Fund's  independent  accounting  firm may require
pre-approval by the Fund's audit committee.

(4) Of course,  it is not a waiver of the Officer  Code if the Fund's  Board (or
committee thereof)  determines that a matter is not a deviation from the Officer
Code's requirements or is otherwise not covered by the Code.


                                       7
<PAGE>

to the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof).  The Board (or  committee)  will
determine  whether to grant the requested  waiver.  If the Board (or  committee)
grants the requested waiver, the DeAM Compliance Officer thereafter will monitor
the activities  subject to the waiver, as appropriate,  and will promptly report
to the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof)  regarding  such  activities,  as
appropriate.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public
disclosures of any waivers granted or any implicit waivers.

VI.      Amendments to the Code

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will review the Officer Code from time to time for
its  continued  appropriateness  and will propose any  amendments  to the Fund's
Board (or  committee  thereof) on a timely  basis.  In  addition,  the Board (or
committee  thereof)  will  review the  Officer  Code at least  annually  for its
continued appropriateness and may amend the Code as necessary or appropriate.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public
disclosures of Code amendments.

VII.     Acknowledgement and Certification of Adherence to the Officer Code

Each Covered Officer must sign a statement upon appointment as a Covered Officer
and annually  thereafter  acknowledging that he or she has received and read the
Officer Code, as amended or updated,  and confirming that he or she has complied
with it (see Appendix B:  Acknowledgement and Certification of Obligations Under
the Officer Code).

Understanding and complying with the Officer Code and truthfully  completing the
Acknowledgement and Certification Form is each Covered Officer's obligation.

The DeAM Compliance  Officer will maintain such  Acknowledgements  in the Fund's
books and records.

VIII.    Scope of Responsibilities

A Covered Officer's responsibilities under the Officer Code are limited to:

         (1)      Fund matters over which the Officer has direct  responsibility
                  or   control,   matters   in  which  the   Officer   routinely
                  participates,  and matters with which the Officer is otherwise
                  involved  (i.e.,  matters  within  the  scope  of the  Covered
                  Officer's responsibilities as a Fund officer); and

         (2)      Fund matters of which the Officer has actual knowledge.


IX.      Recordkeeping

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer  will  create  and  maintain  appropriate  records
regarding  the  implementation  and  operation  of the Officer  Code,  including
records relating to conflicts of interest  determinations  and investigations of
possible Code violations.



                                       8

X.       Confidentiality

All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this  Officer Code
shall  be  considered   confidential  and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Officer  Code,  such
matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the DeAM Compliance Officer,
the Fund's Board (or committee thereof),  legal counsel,  independent  auditors,
and any consultants engaged by the Compliance Officer.

President
Form N-CSR Certification under Sarbanes Oxley Act






I, Vincent J. Esposito, certify that:

1.                I have reviewed this report, filed on behalf of The Central
                  Europe and Russia Fund, a series of Central Europe & Russia
                  Fund, Inc., on Form N-CSR;

2.                Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
                  necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
                  circumstances under which such statements were made, not
                  misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.                Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
                  financial information included in this report, fairly present
                  in all material respects the financial condition, results of
                  operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows (if the
                  financial statements are required to include a statement of
                  cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
                  presented in this report;

4.                The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
                  responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
                  controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
                  Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal control over
                  financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
                  Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

                  (a)      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
                           caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be
                           designed under our supervision, to ensure that
                           material information relating to the registrant,
                           including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
                           known to us by others within those entities,
                           particularly during the period in which this report
                           is being prepared;

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Designed such internal control over financial
                           reporting, or caused such internal control over
                           financial reporting to be designed under our
                           supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
                           regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
                           the preparation of financial statements for external
                           purposes in accordance with generally accepted
                           accounting principles;

                  (c)      Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's

                           this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
                           of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
                           date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this
                           report based on such evaluation; and

                  (d)      Disclosed in this report any change in the
                           registrant's internal control over financial
                           reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
                           recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
                           fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report)
                           that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                           to materially affect, the registrant's internal
                           control over financial reporting; and

5.                The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
                  disclosed to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
                  of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
                  the equivalent functions):

                  (a)      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
                           in the design or operation of internal control over
                           financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
                           adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
                           process, summarize, and report financial information;
                           and

2.                Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
                  necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
                  circumstances under which such statements were made, not
                  misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
         information included in this report, fairly present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net

         include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as

                  (a)      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
                           caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be

                           particularly during the period in which this report
                           is being prepared;

         (b)      Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                  caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
                  designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable
                  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
                  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
                  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

                  (c)      Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's

                           of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
                           date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this
                           report based on such evaluation; and

                  (d)      Disclosed in this report any change in the
                           registrant's internal control over financial
                           reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
                           recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second

                           that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                           to materially affect, the registrant's internal
                           control over financial reporting; and

                           management or other employees who have a significant
                           role in the registrant's internal control over
