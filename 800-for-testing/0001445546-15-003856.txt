                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment in
the Fund. It includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that
provide insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The material risks of investing in the
Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information,
this report and other Fund regulatory filings.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                    ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
                                  MAY 31, 2015


Dear Shareholders:

Thank you for your investment in First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
(the "Fund").

First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") is pleased to provide you with this
annual report, which contains detailed information about your investment for the
12 months ended May 31, 2015, including a portfolio commentary from the Fund's
management team, a performance analysis and a market and Fund outlook.
Additionally, First Trust has compiled the Fund's financial statements for you
to review. We encourage you to read this report and discuss it with your
financial advisor.

U.S. markets, fueled by accelerating growth and an accommodating Federal
Reserve, enjoyed a prosperous year in 2014, though the year was not as
prosperous for senior loan funds. Volatility in the U.S. and global markets,
particularly over the last six months, was created by a combination of economic
and global factors, including the continued conflict in the Middle East and a
sharp decline in oil prices. Another factor that has impacted markets is the
fact that many economists are predicting the Federal Reserve will begin to raise
interest rates this year. This volatility impacted senior loans over the
reporting period, and senior loans which retracted over the past several months
remain in positive territory (though past performance is no guarantee of future
performance).

As I have written previously, First Trust believes investors should maintain
perspective about the markets and have realistic expectations about their
investments. Markets will always go up and down, but we believe that having a
long-term investment horizon and being invested in quality products can help you
reach your goals.

Thank you for giving First Trust the opportunity to be a part of your investment
plan. We value the relationship and will continue to focus on our disciplined
investment approach and long-term perspective to help investors reach their
financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

James A. Bowen
Chairman of the Board of Trustees
Chief Executive Officer of First Trust Advisors L.P.

SCOTT D. FRIES, CFA
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PORTFOLIO MANAGER

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
The primary investment objective of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior floating-rate loan interests
("senior loans"). There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment
objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP
The last 12 months were generally positive for the senior loan market despite
the volatility towards the middle of the period in October and December. The
start of 2015 has been driven by oil showing signs of stability (at least for
now) after a nearly 50% decline in the second half of 2014, a market much more
willing to tolerate the current geopolitical climate, and strength in returns
across credit markets. Moreover, an incredibly strong undercurrent created by
some form of quantitative easing by central banks around the world is driving a
global search for yield. With low and negative yields becoming commonplace in
many countries and central banks furiously weakening currencies to stimulate
demand for their countries' goods and services, the U.S. finds itself standing
alone, with interest rate increases, not decreases, on the horizon and a strong
currency. The net result is that investors around the world are buying U.S.
fixed-income instruments at an extraordinary pace. We believe the combination of
this powerful technical demand for U.S. fixed-income securities, a healthy,
albeit slow growing, U.S. economy, and sound fundamentals (modest corporate
defaults) within corporate America should continue to support the performance of
fixed-income markets, including senior loans and high-yield bonds.

SENIOR LOAN MARKET
The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index returned 2.84% for the 12-month period ending
May 31, 2015. From a credit quality perspective, the returns were mixed. Lower
quality CCC rated issues returned 3.77% in the period, outperforming the returns
of higher quality B rated issues at 3.14% and nearly matching BB rated issues at
3.79%. The average price of loans in the market began the period at $99.01 and,
after bottoming at $95.92 at the end of December, loan prices ended the period
at $97.39. (Source: S&P/LCD)

CREDIT QUALITY/DEFAULT RATES
Default rates continue to remain low, as compared to long-term averages in
senior loans. We believe this is because corporate fundamentals remain healthy,
as evidenced by the fact that senior loan issuers that file their financial
results publicly grew cash flows by approximately 6% year-over-year in the first
quarter of 2015, which represents 23 straight quarters of cash flow growth.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The Fund outperformed the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index on a net asset value
("NAV") basis for the 12-month period. The Fund generated an NAV return of 4.68%
and a market price return of 4.64%. The Fund's discount to NAV ended the period
nearly unchanged from one year ago. At the start of the period, the Fund's
market price was at a 6.35% discount to NAV, and moved to a 6.39% discount to
NAV by the end of the period.

PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY (CONTINUED)

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                 ANNUAL REPORT
                                  MAY 31, 2015


From an income perspective, the monthly announced distribution rate began the
period at $0.07125 per share and ended at $0.075 per share. For some time now,
the consequence of robust demand for senior loans has been declining yields.
However, the volatility experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulted in
senior loan spreads widening, creating opportunities to increase the income
generated by the Fund's holdings. At the $0.075 per share monthly distribution
rate, the annualized distribution rate at the end of May 2015 was 6.12% at NAV
and 6.54% at market price.

Contributing to the Fund's outperformance relative to the S&P/LSTA Leveraged
Loan Index over the period was the Fund's use of leverage and its issuer
selection. The use of leverage contributed positively to the Fund's performance
as the total return of senior loans exceeded the borrowing cost. Leverage at the
end of May was approximately 28.8% of managed assets. Performance across credit
quality was closely mixed and not a meaningful driver of performance; however,
we continue to remain underweight in issues rated CCC+ and below. At the end of
the period, the Fund held 4.7% of assets in issues rated CCC+ or below compared
to 7.0% for the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK
Credit markets appear well positioned for the intermediate term, in our opinion.
We believe the combination of strong technical tailwinds created by global
central bank policy, attractive valuations within the credit markets, a
below-average default rate environment, modest but healthy economic growth and
sound corporate fundamentals provides a firm backdrop for returns in the periods
ahead. We continue to believe that steadily improving economic data (GDP growth
of approximately 2.5%-3% and improving unemployment) will provide the Fed the
motivation it requires to begin the process of raising interest rates later this
year, likely driving greater demand for senior loans.

Based on current valuations, we believe senior loans, given their senior-secured
position in the capital structure and floating interest rate, are well
positioned as we move through 2015. While headline risk, ranging from oil price
volatility to geopolitical turmoil, may continue to influence risk sentiment,
and is important to monitor, we believe investors will be well served to stay
the course given that these concerns are not likely to result in derailing the
U.S. economy from its current trajectory. Moreover, while lower interest rates
proved to be a rather substantial tailwind to fixed-income securities in 2014,
the risk of raising rates on traditional fixed-income securities has only
increased, in our opinion. We believe there remains a substantial asymmetry in
the risk vs. reward equation for long-duration fixed-income securities (those
with the most rate sensitivity). As a result, even modestly increasing interest
rates can present challenges for traditional fixed-income investors.

In summary, we believe that credit markets offer compelling opportunities today,
principally within an actively managed framework where risk can be appropriately
managed. As we evaluate new investment opportunities, decisions will continue to
be rooted in our rigorous bottom-up credit analysis and focus on the
opportunities that we believe offer the best risk and reward balance. Despite
the many distractions that ebb and flow every quarter, we remain firmly focused
on finding value in the senior loan market.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS (a) (CONTINUED)
MAY 31, 2015


-----------------------------

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest at rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime
      rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the certificate
      of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR floor that
      establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown reflects the
      rate in effect at May 31, 2015. When a range of rates is disclosed the
      Fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche at varying
      rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   This issuer has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(e)   This issuer is in default but interest is still being accrued by the Fund
      and paid by the issuer.

(f)   This security is fair valued by the Pricing Committee of First Trust
      Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") in accordance with procedures adopted by the
      Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the
      Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. At May 31, 2015, securities
      noted as such are valued at $3,414,225 or 0.87% of net assets.

(g)   This security, sold within the terms of a private placement memorandum, is
      exempt from registration upon resale under Rule 144A under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended, and may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. Pursuant to
      procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this security has been
      determined to be liquid by the Advisor. Although market instability can
      result in periods of increased overall market illiquidity, liquidity for
      each security is determined based on security-specific factors and
      assumptions, which require subjective judgment. At May 31, 2015,securities
      noted as such amounted to $12,675,722 or 3.23% of net assets.

(h)   These notes are Payment-in-Kind ("PIK") Toggle Notes ("Notes") whereby the
      issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on the Notes (1) entirely
      in cash or (2) entirely in PIK interest. Interest paid in cash will accrue
      at the rate of 10% per annum ("Cash Interest Rate") and PIK interest will
      accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum equal to the Cash Interest Rate
      plus 2%. For the year ended May 31, 2015, the Fund received $26,100 in PIK
      interest.

(i)   Floating rate security. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in
      effect at May 31, 2015.

(j)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Prior
      to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions
      exempt from registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes
      to Financial Statements).

(k)   Non-income producing security.

(l)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $548,680,487. As of May
      31, 2015, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities
      in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $2,308,588 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $8,950,168.

All transfers in and out of the levels during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. There were no
transfers between levels at May 31, 2015.

Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests are valued by the Advisor's Pricing
Committee. Level 3 securities are valued using a recent transaction price. The
values are based on unobservable and non-quantitative inputs. The Fund's Board
of Trustees has adopted valuation procedures that are utilized by the Pricing
Committee to oversee the day-to-day valuation of the Fund's investments. The
Advisor's Pricing Committee, through the Fund's accounting agent, monitors daily
pricing via tolerance checks and stale and unchanged price reviews. The
Advisor's Pricing Committee also reviews monthly back testing of pricing service
prices by comparing sales prices of Fund investments to prior day pricing
service prices. Additionally, the Advisor's Pricing Committee reviews periodic
information from the Fund's third-party pricing service that compares secondary
market trade prices to their daily valuations.

The following table presents the Fund's investments measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the period
presented:

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2015


                                1. ORGANIZATION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior
floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans").(1) There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Fund, which is an investment company within the scope of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update 2013-08, follows
accounting and reporting guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 946, "Financial Services-Investment Companies."

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The Fund's NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value. Market
value prices represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or
foreign exchange (i.e., a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from
third-party pricing services. Fair value prices represent any prices not
considered market value prices and are either obtained from a third-party
pricing service or are determined by the Pricing Committee of the Fund's
investment advisor, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust" or the "Advisor"),
in accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
and in accordance with provisions of the 1940 Act. Investments valued by the
Advisor's Pricing Committee, if any, are footnoted as such in the footnotes to
the Portfolio of Investments. The Fund's investments are valued as follows:

      The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
      securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought
      and sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private
      transactions that function in many respects like an over-the-counter
      secondary market, although typically no formal market-makers exist. This
      market, while having grown substantially since its inception, generally
      has fewer trades and less liquidity than the secondary market for other
      types of securities. Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade
      infrequently, and information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be
      widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the
      fair market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent and dated
      information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
      elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans
      than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are fair
      valued using information provided by a third-party pricing service. The
      third-party pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from
      dealer runs and broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior
      Loans.

      Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or
      foreign exchange (excluding The NASDAQ(R) Stock Market, LLC ("NASDAQ") and
      the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are
      valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which they are
      principally traded or, for NASDAQ and AIM securities, the official closing
      price. Securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued
      at the last sale price or official closing price, as applicable, at the
      close of the securities exchange representing the principal market for
      such securities.

(1)   The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2015

      Corporate bonds, corporate notes and other debt securities are valued on
      the basis of valuations provided by dealers who make markets in such
      securities or by an independent pricing service approved by the Fund's
      Board of Trustees, which may use the following valuation inputs when
      available:

      1)    benchmark yields;
      2)    reported trades;
      3)    broker/dealer quotes;
      4)    issuer spreads;
      5)    benchmark securities;
      6)    bids and offers; and
      7)    reference data including market research publications.

      Fixed-income and other debt securities having a remaining maturity of 60
      days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost adjusted for
      amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts (amortized cost),
      provided the Advisor's Pricing Committee has determined that the use of
      amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value given market and
      issuer-specific conditions existing at the time of the determination.
      Factors that may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the
      use of amortized cost include, but are not limited to, the following:

      1)    the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      2)    the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      3)    the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and changes
            thereto (such as significant changes in interest rates);
      4)    issuer-specific conditions (such as significant credit
            deterioration); and
      5)    any other market-based data the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            considers relevant. In this regard, the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            may use last-obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing
            portfolio securities using amortized cost.

Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate, the Advisor's Pricing Committee, at fair value. These securities
generally include, but are not limited to, restricted securities (securities
which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")) for which a pricing service is unable to
provide a market price; securities whose trading has been formally suspended; a
security whose market or fair value price is not available from a
pre-established pricing source; a security with respect to which an event has
occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the security after the
market has closed but before the calculation of the Fund's NAV or make it
difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation; and a security
whose price, as provided by the pricing service, does not reflect the security's
fair value. As a general principle, the current fair value of a security would
appear to be the amount which the owner might reasonably expect to receive for
the security upon its current sale. When fair value prices are used, generally
they will differ from market quotations or official closing prices on the
applicable exchanges. A variety of factors may be considered in determining the
fair value of such securities, including, but not limited to, the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;
      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;
      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;
      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;
      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;
      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;
      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;
      8)    the coupon payments;
      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;
      10)   the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;
      11)   the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;
      12)   borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;
      13)   borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and
      14)   other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.


                                                                         Page 23

                                  MAY 31, 2015


      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of May 31, 2015, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward purchase commitments as of May
31, 2015.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had no unfunded delayed draw loan commitments as
of May 31, 2015.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior
to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt
from registration under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified
institutional buyers. As of May 31, 2015, the Fund held restricted securities as
shown in the following table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that
such securities be registered. These securities are valued according to the
valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and
are not expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable
unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted investments with the same
maturity date and yield for this issuer.

</TABLE>

* Amount is less than 0.01%.


E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2015


at some time in the future. Permanent differences incurred during the fiscal
year ended May 31, 2015, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have
been reclassified at year end to reflect an increase in accumulated net
investment income (loss) of $291,896, a decrease in accumulated net realized
gain (loss) on investments of $344,881, and an increase to paid-in capital of
$52,985. Net assets were not affected by these reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2015 and 2014 is as follows:

Distributions paid from:                               2015            2014
                                                   -------------   -------------
Ordinary income................................    $  22,405,442   $  25,186,591

As of May 31, 2015, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income..................    $   1,091,262
Undistributed capital gains....................               --
                                                   -------------
Total undistributed earnings...................        1,091,262
Accumulated capital and other losses...........     (103,181,356)
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation).....       (6,641,580)
                                                   -------------
Total accumulated earnings (losses)............     (108,731,674)
Other..........................................               --
Paid-in capital................................      501,431,132
                                                   -------------
Net assets.....................................    $ 392,699,458
                                                   =============

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal and state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years after December 31, 2010, may be
carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term
and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for
up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the
Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment
net capital losses. At May 31, 2015, for federal income tax purposes, the Fund
had capital loss carryforwards available that are shown in the following table,
to the extent provided by regulation, to offset future capital gains through the
years indicated. To the extent that these loss carryforwards are used to offset
future capital gains, it is probable that the capital gains offset will not be
distributed to the Fund shareholders.

    $  422,155    $  25,585,953    $  68,278,827    $   4,665,052    $     3,397,798    $  102,349,785
</TABLE>


The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

Certain losses realized during the current fiscal year may be deferred and
treated as occurring the first day of the following fiscal year for federal
income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015, the Fund incurred
and elected to defer net ordinary and capital losses as follows:

Qualified Late Year Losses:

Ordinary Losses     $         --
Capital Losses           831,571

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2012, 2013,
2014 and 2015 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2015,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.


                                                                         Page 25

3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. The Charger Corporation is an Illinois corporation
controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First Trust. First
Trust is responsible for the selection and ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee
calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets (the average
daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's liabilities
other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also provides fund
reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNYM IS") serves as the Fund's
administrator, fund accountant and transfer agent in accordance with certain fee
arrangements. As administrator and fund accountant, BNYM IS is responsible for
providing certain administrative and accounting services to the Fund, including
maintaining the Fund's books of account, records of the Fund's securities
transactions, and certain other books and records. As transfer agent, BNYM IS is
responsible for maintaining shareholder records for the Fund. The Bank of New
York Mellon ("BNYM") serves as the Fund's custodian in accordance with certain
fee arrangements. As custodian, BNYM is responsible for custody of the Fund's
assets.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer that is allocated pro rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund
Complex based on net assets. Each Independent Trustee is also paid an annual per
fund fee that varies based on whether the fund is a closed-end or other actively
managed fund, or is an index fund.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee and the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee are paid
annual fees to serve in such capacities, with such compensation allocated pro
rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.
Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and Committee Chairmen rotate every
three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no compensation from
the Fund for acting in such capacities.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the year ended May 31, 2015, were $355,473,820 and
$373,069,853, respectively.

                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Facility")
with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as
secondary lender and agent for the secured parties under the agreement. The
Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the terms of the
Credit Facility, the loans under the Credit Facility bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
conduit lender. Effective July 11, 2014, the Credit Facility was amended,
whereby the expiration date of the Credit Facility was extended until July 10,
2015 and the total commitment was reduced from $190,000,000 to $185,000,000. The
Credit Facility may be renewed annually. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act,
the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of
at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The Fund
pays a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.3625% (prior to July 11, 2014,
the per annum rate was 0.35%) of the daily average of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the advances during the prior calendar month, and a
commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i) 0.3625% (prior to July
11, 2014, the per annum rate was 0.35%) of the daily average of the total
commitment in effect (or if terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the advances funded or maintained) during the preceding calendar month
and (ii) 1.02.

For the year ended May 31, 2015, the average amount outstanding under the Credit
Facility was $168,772,603. The high and low annual interest rates for the loan
under the Credit Facility funded by the conduit lender during the year ended May
31, 2015, were 0.232% and 0.199%, respectively, with a weighted average interest
rate of 0.210%. The annual interest rate in effect for the loan at May 31, 2015,
was 0.232%.

                           6. COMMON SHARE OFFERINGS

On November 21, 2012, the Fund and the Advisor entered into a sales agreement
with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC ("JonesTrading") whereby the Fund
may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 Common Shares from time to time through
JonesTrading as agent for the offer and sale of the Common Shares. Effective
August 22, 2013, the sales agreement with JonesTrading was amended and as a
result, the Fund may offer and sell up to 4,225,967 Common Shares. Sales of
Common Shares pursuant to the sales agreement may be made in negotiated
transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" as defined in
Rule 415 under the 1933 Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales
made through a market maker other than on an exchange, at an offering price
equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share of the Fund's Common
Shares at the time such Common Shares are initially sold. The Fund used the net
proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares in accordance with its investment
objectives and policies. Sales of Common Shares made under the sales agreement
will be made pursuant to a "shelf" registration statement on Form N-2 (the
"Registration Statement") that will require the Fund to obtain effectiveness

from the SEC on an annual basis. The Registration Statement has not been
effective since September 2014, and therefore Common Shares have not been
offered under the sales agreement since that time. Any future sales of Common
Shares under the sales agreement will be made pursuant to an effective
Registration Statement. Transactions related to offerings under such sales

Estimated offering costs of $235,169 related to the November 21, 2012 offering
were recorded as a prepaid asset and were amortized to expense by the Fund on a
straight line basis over a one year period. Additionally, on August 23, 2013,
estimated offering costs of $175,000 related to the offering were recorded as a
prepaid asset and were amortized to expense by the Fund on a straight line basis
over a one year period. During the year ended May 31, 2015, it was determined
that actual offering costs were less than the estimated offering costs by
$92,925. Therefore, offering costs were reduced by that amount in the year ended
May 31, 2015, as reflected in the "At the market offering costs" line item on
the Statement of Operations.

                               7. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

Effective July 10, 2015, the Credit Facility was amended whereby the expiration
date was extended until July 8, 2016 and the total commitment was reduced from
$185,000,000 to $180,000,000.

On June 22, 2015, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.075 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on July 6, 2015, payable July 15, 2015.

On July 20, 2015, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.075 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on August 5, 2015, payable August 17, 2015.



                                                                         Page 27

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2015 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and agent banks; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2015, the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1) If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
      the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal to
      the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii) 95% of the
      market price on that date.

      (2) If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
      Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
      purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for
      the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for the
      Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
      purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the
      Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
      in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had
      been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all
      dividends and distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in
      the open market within 30 days of the valuation date except where
      temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply
      with federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
      cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend

                                TAX INFORMATION

Of the ordinary income (including short-term capital gain) distributions made by
the Fund during the year ended May 31, 2015, none qualify for the corporate
dividends received deduction available to corporate shareholders or as qualified
dividend income.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree. High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and
risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an
issuer's creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the
default by an issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for
high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade
securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and

                            MAY 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)


distributions with respect to Common Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use
of leverage by the Fund increases the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV
and market price of the Common Shares. Leverage also increases the risk that
fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund
may pay will reduce the return to the Common Shareholders or will result in
fluctuations in the dividends paid on the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security h--eld by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK: Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK: The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. If the economy
experiences a sudden downturn, or if the debt markets for such companies become
distressed, the Fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in
sufficient amounts, at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner -
to raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by
Fund shareholders.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

(a)   The registrant, as of the end of the period covered by this report, has
      adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
      executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
      officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless
      of whether these individuals are employed by the registrant or a third

      description.

(d)   The registrant has not granted any waivers, including an implicit waiver,
      from a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
      principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
      accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
      regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the registrant or
      a third party, that relates to one or more of the items set forth in
      paragraph (b) of this item's instructions.

(e)   Not applicable.


ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

As of the end of the period covered by the report, the registrant's Board of
Trustees has determined that Thomas R. Kadlec and Robert F. Keith are qualified
to serve as audit committee financial experts serving on its audit committee and
that each of them is "independent," as defined by Item 3 of Form N-CSR.


ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

(a)   AUDIT FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed for each of the last
      two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal
      accountant for the audit of the registrant's annual financial statements
      or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection
      with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $89,000 for 2014
      and $70,000 for 2015.

(b)   AUDIT-RELATED FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of
      the last two fiscal years, for assurance and related services by the
      principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the
      audit of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported under
      paragraph (a) of this Item were $0 for 2014 and $0 for 2015.

      AUDIT-RELATED FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
      each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for assurance and
      related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related
      to the performance of the audit of the Registrant's financial statements
      and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this Item were $0 for 2014 and
      $0 for 2015.

(c)   TAX FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two
      fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal
      accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the
      registrant were $5,200 for 2014 and $5,200 for 2015. These fees were for

      by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax
      planning to the registrant's adviser were $0 for 2014 and $0 for 2015.

(d)   ALL OTHER FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the
      last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
      accountant to the registrant, other than the services reported in
      paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2014 and $0 for 2015.

      ALL OTHER FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
      of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the
      principal accountant to the Registrant's investment adviser, other than
      services reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for
      2014 and $0 for 2015.

(e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
       described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

      Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

      The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
       (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser of this
       Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the
       pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph
       (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                          (b)  0%
                          (c)  0%
                          (d)  0%

(f)   The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's engagement
      to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most recent fiscal
      year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the
      principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees was less than fifty
      percent.

(g)   The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
      services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
      investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
      portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
      investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under
      common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the
      Registrant for 2014 were $5,200 and $36,800 for the Registrant and the
      Registrant's investment adviser, respectively, and for 2015 were $5,200
      and $12,700 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser,
      respectively.

(h)   The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined that
      the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Registrant's
      investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
      portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
      investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under
      common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services
      to the Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph
      (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining
      the principal accountant's independence.


ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

(a)   The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee
      consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The members
      of the audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B. Nielson, Richard E.
      Erickson and Robert F. Keith.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. The First Trust Leveraged Finance Team
adheres to its trade allocation policy utilizing a pro-rata methodology to
address this conflict.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations.

In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the Code of Ethics
and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the Leveraged Finance
Team currently are prohibited from buying or selling equity securities
(including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and futures) and
corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over which they
exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Team are also prohibited
from engaging in any personal transaction while in possession of material
non-public information regarding the security or the issuer of the security.
First Trust and FTP also maintain a restricted list of all issuers for which the
First Trust Advisors L.P. Leveraged Finance Team has material non-public
information in its possession and all transactions executed for a product
advised or supervised by First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the
restricted list.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.

II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
