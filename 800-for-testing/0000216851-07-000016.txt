2006 saw the fifth consecutive year of the cyclical upturn of oil and natural
gas prices and strong share price performance in the energy sector. While the
performance of commodity prices and energy equities in general has been
outstanding during the period, disparities began to show up during the year, as
might be expected in the latter part of a cycle. The total return on net assets
of Petroleum & Resources Corporation in 2006, after reinvestment of dividends
and capital gain distributions, was 15.7% and the return on market value was
15.3%. The Dow Jones Oil & Gas Index (DJOGI) rose 21% during the year, while
the broader S&P 500 Index returned 15.8%. The Fund's diversification within the
energy industry and its non-energy investments are the main reasons its
performance lagged that of the DJOGI while approximating the S&P 500. In this
annual report, we will summarize market events and our performance for the
year. We will also discuss how we see energy markets unfolding in 2007 and
factors which may affect them.

A REVIEW OF 2006
What seemed to be a likely crisis for petroleum markets in the aftermath of
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita did not materialize in 2006 as generally mild
temperatures helped to
keep oil prices from reaching even higher levels during the 2005-2006 heating
season. The reduced demand domestically served to calm the markets early in the
year. Though a great deal transpired in the intervening months, the end of 2006
was marked by mild temperatures again, resulting in the spot price of West
Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) closing the year at $61.05, just 1 cent
higher than it began the year.

During the year, commodity prices were marked by great volatility, with WTI
ranging from a high of $77 in July to a low of $56 in November. Strong
worldwide demand coupled with actual or perceived capacity shortages and
geopolitical unrest pushed prices higher in the first half of the year. Renewed
attacks in Iraq, Iran's nuclear ambitions, terrorist attacks in Nigeria, and
the brief war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon all served to heighten
anxiety among oil traders. Expectations of another damaging hurricane season
and the slow recovery of operations subsequent to the 2005 hurricane season led
market participants to buy additional contracts early in the year, pushing the
price up. As the hurricane season wound down and little damage was incurred,
traders liquidated their positions and a massive sell-off took place,
concluding in November.

In fact, the growth in worldwide demand for oil declined modestly in 2006, from
the 1.5% rate of the past to a 1.1% rate as higher prices began to affect the
world's economies. China still accounted for 41% of the increase, followed by
India at 6%, according to the International Energy Agency. Worldwide production
grew by roughly 1.2%, resulting in the tight supply/demand balance in existence
much of the year. OPEC maintained its production quota of 28 million barrels
per day (excluding Iraq). Toward the end of the year, demand began to reflect
the higher prices and inventories started building around the world. OPEC
responded by announcing the first production cut, of 1.2 million barrels per
day, since April 2004. With prices drifting to the low end of its desired
range, OPEC announced another, smaller cut in production to take effect in
February 2007. Further strengthening its influence on oil prices was the
announcement that Angola, a 2 million barrel per day producer, would join OPEC
in January of 2007.

The domestic market for gasoline was also quite volatile during the year as
refining bottlenecks were experienced and supplies fell short at critical
times. The aftereffects of the hurricanes of 2005 were partly responsible as
refinery restarts were slow in coming and functioning refineries had to be
taken down for maintenance after operating at high utilization levels for
extended periods. In addition, MTBE was effectively banned as an additive,
resulting in the need to reformulate some products. Downstream (product)
margins were strong the first half of the year as a result. During the summer
driving season, with robust demand, the average retail price of regular
gasoline exceeded $3 per gallon for four consecutive weeks.

The high oil prices realized during 2006 funded heavy exploration for
conventional oil and also provided an opportunity for non-conventional
hydrocarbons to come into the market. The demand for oil rigs, equipment, and
services drove up prices for those items considerably; oil service stocks rose
as well. The higher prices of services and equipment were also reflected in the
cost to find and produce new reserves. Development of oil sands, mostly in
Canada, continued at high levels and biofuels attracted interest, driven by
both federal mandates and profitability. In the U. S., corn-based ethanol
refineries sprang up throughout the Midwest and built market share in the
gasoline

sector. Thus far, all of the non-conventional fuels are more costly to produce
than oil and gas and rely on subsidies, but they have helped sustain the higher
price of the traditional fuels.

The volatility of natural gas prices in 2006 was even greater than that of oil,
largely due to the extremes of weather experienced. These are generally
temporary in nature, but highly unpredictable, as evidenced by the hurricanes
in 2005 and the lack thereof in 2006. There has also been a fundamental change
in the demand for natural gas, in the form of demand destruction due to
efficiencies and industrial demand lost to lower-cost producers. Low gas usage
in the warm winter of 2005-2006 was partially offset by power generation needs
during the hot summer months. The lack of supply interruptions and record
natural gas drilling and well completions resulted in a high level of supply.
Strong cash flows and good drilling opportunities enabled producing companies
to maintain active drilling programs. The result has been a significant
increase in the level of domestic natural gas storage and depressed natural gas
prices. Prices for the front month contract started the year at $11.225 per
million BTU, the peak for the year, and closed the year at $6.299 per million
BTU. At the same time, production and reserve growth objectives forced
exploration and production (E&P) companies to compete for equipment and
services. Costs rose, commodity prices declined, and margins were squeezed.

Prices for our other principal source of energy, coal, were also volatile
during 2006. After several years of strong price increases and rising
utilization rates at coal-fired power plants, the coal industry responded with
higher levels of production early in 2006. A mild end to the winter and ample
supplies of natural gas resulted in a build-up in inventories through the year
and weaker prices toward the end of the year.

ENERGY SECTOR PERFORMANCE
Energy stocks performed very well during most of 2006, as the price of oil rose
steadily through July and remained in the $60-$65 range for the bulk of the
rest of the year. By the end of November, the Dow Jones Oil & Gas Index (DJOGI)
had risen 23.8%. It was only in the final weeks of 2006 that commodity prices
dropped precipitously and the energy stocks followed them down. For the year as
a whole, the DJOGI rose 21%. The DJOGI is weighted by market capitalization,
resulting in great emphasis on large, integrated energy companies such as Exxon
Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. Those three companies comprise over 50% of
the DJOGI. With high oil prices, strong margins in refining and marketing, and
capital discipline, the major integrated companies generated large amounts of
cash in the first half of 2006 and used it for exploration, expanded
production, dividend increases, and large share repurchases. As the year
progressed, industry dynamics changed, especially for companies focused on
natural gas. Drilling and well completion success combined with the absence of
major hurricanes resulted in a build-up of inventory, which in turn dimmed the
prospects of smaller exploration and production companies. The stocks of many
of these companies fell by more than 10% in the final weeks of the year. The
"majors," with their more diversified operations, held up considerably better,
with returns of 21% (ConocoPhillips) to 35% (Exxon Mobil). While the Fund has
large positions in the "majors" (23.2% in the three mentioned above), its
diversification, which is done primarily to reduce risk and is normally
beneficial for the Fund's performance, worked against it. In addition, holdings
in chemicals, materials, and utilities did not perform as well as the large
energy companies.

INVESTMENT RESULTS
Net assets of the Corporation on December 31, 2006 were $812,047,239 or $36.61
per share on 22,180,867 shares outstanding. This compares with $761,913,652 or
$35.24 per share on 21,621,072 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2006 was $9,844,108 compared to $11,391,783 for 2005.
These earnings are equivalent to $0.47 and $0.53 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. Our 0.60%
expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) was once again at a low level
compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $69,700,053 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $428,811,345 at December
31, 2005 to $462,398,019 at year end.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Total dividends and distributions paid in 2006 were $3.80 per share compared to
$1.78 in 2005. The table on page 22 shows the history of our dividends and
distributions over the past fifteen years, including the annual rate of
distribution as a percentage of the average daily market price of the
Corporation's Common Stock. In 2006, the annual rate of distribution was 11.26%
compared to 5.90% in 2005. As announced on November 9, 2006, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.18 and capital gains of
$3.23 was made on December 27, 2006, both realized and taxable in 2006. On
January 11, 2007, an additional distribution of $0.13 per share was declared to
shareholders of record February 15, 2007, payable March 1, 2007, representing
undistributed net investment income and capital gains earned in 2006, taxable
to shareholders in 2007.

OUTLOOK FOR 2007
The price of oil has fallen 14% in the first several weeks of 2007 in response
to the growing inventories of crude and refined products. OPEC has cut
production once and has announced a second, albeit smaller, cut to take effect
in February. These actions have had no impact on the price of the commodity.
Demand for gasoline and other refined products is not growing at its historic
rate as world economies are experiencing slower growth. Worldwide supply and
demand are not likely to come back into balance in the near future without more
production cuts by OPEC members. The increased levels of exploration activity
in recent years will result in higher non-OPEC production in 2007 and 2008.
Still, there is very little excess productive capacity in the world today and
that is why prices remain relatively high. Any significant disruption in the
oil fields, due to natural forces, terrorism, or other geopolitical activity,
would drive prices back up to their recent highs and perhaps beyond in short
order. It is for this reason that prices are not considerably lower today.

Our view of the world economy in 2007 is that it is likely to experience slower
growth, on the order of 3.5%, down from about 4% in 2006. The U. S. economy,
the largest user of oil, is expected to grow only 2-2 1/2% this year as the
effects of higher commodity prices (including energy, industrial, and
agricultural) and short-term interest rates are felt. While an inverted yield
curve (higher short-term than long-term rates), such as that experienced in the
last 18 months, has historically presaged recession in this country, we do not
expect that to occur. Corporate balance sheets are generally in good condition,
with many companies carrying large amounts of cash. The weakness in the housing
and auto industries does not appear to be spilling over into the rest of the
economy. Of course, further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to fight
perceived inflation risks could drive the economy into recession, as could
spikes in commodity prices. Barring these, we are comfortable that the economy
will continue to grow, although at a reduced pace from 2006 and previously.
Many of the other economies of the world are in similar situations to the U.S.
Central banks have raised rates to slow growth and all economies are being hit
by higher commodity prices.

Given this economic outlook, we expect that the price of oil will gradually
decline as non-OPEC oil production picks up, a worldwide emphasis on
alternative fuels begins to have an effect on demand, and OPEC is shown to have
only partial success in controlling supply. Most industry participants have
benefited greatly from the increasing prices of the past several years, but the
opportunities to put the cash generated to work in the oilfields have been
limited. A number of countries have moved to take control of their energy
resources (Russia, Venezuela, Bolivia), while others have tried to lock up
foreign supplies through their national oil companies (China, India). This has
further limited the opportunities available to the industry. Therefore, we are
not looking for oil stocks to outperform the rest of the equity market again in
2007. Earnings comparisons are likely to be unfavorable as the cycle passes its
peak. Valuations, on the other hand, may be driven up as a result of continued
consolidation activity. With large amounts of cash on hand, companies may be
tempted to purchase reserves rather than drill for them. We do expect continued
heavy exploration activity, though, to bring new oil reserves on stream several
years from now. This will benefit the offshore drilling and oil service
companies, whose stocks should perform relatively well.

The natural gas market is also likely to be a difficult one in 2007 unless the
large inventories are worked off in an extended period of cold weather. Without
such a weather change, prices are expected to decline through the spring and
into the summer cooling season. Any firming of prices is unlikely to occur
before the second half of the year. This would be precipitated by lower
production as drilling activity slows in response to the lower prices of the
spring and summer. Companies predominantly involved in natural gas production
are not expected to perform well in the short term, nor are drilling and
service companies in that sector.

While our outlook for 2007 at this point is rather pessimistic, the longer term
outlook remains solid. Worldwide supplies of oil and natural gas are not
growing much and the substitution of alternatives is minimal to date. The
economic slowdown discussed above will temporarily slow the growth in demand,
but we expect economic growth to pick up in 2008 and beyond, stimulating the
demand for energy.

In anticipation of the short-term weakness, we have sold or reduced positions
in a number of gas-oriented companies and increased our holdings of integrated
producers. These companies are in the best position to act as consolidators in
the industry and gain market share, which will benefit them when the cycle
turns up again.

SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING
We were gratified with the strong support shown by our shareholders at the
special meeting held on November 7, 2006. All eight of the proposals of the
Board of Directors were overwhelmingly approved, with no proposal

                                                                             5

receiving less than 83% of the votes cast. A full report of the meeting can be
found on page 24. The approval of these important changes to the corporate
charter provides the Corporation with additional tools to protect the interests
of our long-term shareholders. You have clearly expressed your interest in
seeing the Corporation continue as a closed-end fund, and your action has
strengthened our ability to do so.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On December 14, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation
over the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the restriction
that shares can only be repurchased when the discount of the market price of
the shares from the net asset value is 6.5% or greater.

From the beginning of 2007 through January 25, 2007, 51,425 shares have been
repurchased at a total cost of $1,627,011 and a weighted average discount from
net asset value of 9.2%.

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Baltimore on March 27, 2007, is expected to be mailed on or about February 16,
2007.

By order of the Board of Directors,


             /s/ Douglas G. Ober

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation is an internally-managed fund emphasizing petroleum and other
natural resource investments. The investment objectives of the Corporation are
preservation of capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments,
and an opportunity for capital appreciation.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on national securities
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2006 was $395,384,038, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $462,235,183, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $466,819,816 and $4,584,633, respectively.
As of December 31, 2006, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $1,378,831
of undistributed ordinary income and $1,527,213 of undistributed long-term
capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2006
were classified as ordinary income of $17,053,276 and capital gain of
$62,529,943. In comparison, distributions paid by the Corporation during the
year ended December 31, 2005 were classified as ordinary income of $15,437,432
and capital gain of $22,517,289. The distributions are determined in accordance
with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within the
Corporation's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under income tax regulations.

5. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation applied the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Statement No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans, at December 31, 2006. This accounting standard
requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined
benefit plan in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, and recognition of
changes in the funded status in the years in which the changes occur through
the capital accounts. The transition rules for implementing the standard
require applying the provisions as of the end of the year of initial
implementation with no retrospective application. The incremental effects on
the line items in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities at December 31, 2006,
are as follows:

The assumption for the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on the
actual long-term historical returns realized by the plan assets, weighted
according to the current asset mix.

The asset allocations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, by asset category, are as
follows:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

Equity securities include common stock of The Adams Express Company, the
Corporation's non-controlled affiliate, in the amount of $236,906 (5% of total
plan assets) and $203,280 (5% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

The primary objective of the Corporation's pension plan is to provide capital
appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital through a portfolio
of stocks and fixed income securities. The equity portion of the portfolio may
range from 50% to 75% of total portfolio assets. The fixed income portion of
the portfolio may range from 25% to 50% of total portfolio assets and cash may
range from 0% to 25% of total portfolio assets. Subject to these allocation
ranges, the portfolio may be invested in any of the following securities:
common stocks, preferred stocks, American Depository Receipts, foreign
securities, mutual funds, convertible securities, municipal bonds, corporate
bonds, U.S. government securities and U.S. government agency securities.

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Corporation anticipates
making contributions of approximately $430,000 to the plans in 2007.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. The Corporation expensed contributions to this
plan of $97,787 and $85,570 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December
31, 2005, respectively. The Corporation does not provide postretirement medical
benefits.

6. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this Plan although unexercised awards
granted in 2004 and prior years remain outstanding. The 1985 Plan permitted the
issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up
to 895,522 shares of the Corporation's Common Stock at the fair market value on
the date of grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by
the Corporation during subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not
less than one year after the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant. The
stock appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to
exercise their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the
difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the
Common Stock at the date of surrender. All options terminate 10 years from the
date of grant if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2006, and
changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based
restricted stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of
a specified three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned
contingent on achieving certain performance targets. If performance targets are
not achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based restricted shares are
forfeited and become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based
restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three year period and
nonperformance-based restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors)
vest over a one year period. It is the current intention that employee grants
will be performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in
the event of death or retirement. Non-employee directors also may elect to
defer a portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be
paid by delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards were granted at
fair market value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which
remain available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2006 is
845,044 shares.

The Corporation pays dividends and dividend equivalent on outstanding awards,
which are charged to net assets when paid. Dividends and dividend equivalents
paid on restricted awards that are later forfeited are reclassified to
compensation expense.

A summary of the status of the Corporations's awards granted under the 2005
Plan as of December 31, 2006, and changes during the period then ended is
presented below:

        Balance at December 31, 2006 (includes
         13,025 performance-based awards and

        ---------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $194,555.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $157,778. As of December
31, 2006, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $387,049, a
component of additional capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based
compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.76 years. The total fair
value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
$196,956 and $12,500.

7. EXPENSES

The aggregate remuneration paid during the year ended December 31, 2006 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,208,421, of which $376,911 was paid as
fees to directors who were not officers. These amounts represent the taxable
income to the Corporation's officers and directors and therefore differ from
the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of Operations that are
recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

8. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues to receive interest
or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had securities on loan
of $42,198,831, and held collateral of $43,181,867, consisting of an investment
trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

9. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how
uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed
in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns
to determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being
sustained

                                                                             13

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in
the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is required to be implemented no later
than the Corporation's June 29, 2007 net asset value. The application of FIN 48
is not expected to materially impact the Corporation's financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("FAS 157"), which provides enhanced guidance
for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard requires
companies to provide expanded information about the assets and liabilities
measured at fair value and the potential effect of these fair valuations on an
entity's financial performance. The standard does not expand the use of fair
value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification on acceptable fair
valuation methods and applications. Adoption of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. Application of the standard is not
expected to materially impact the Corporation's financial statements.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at December 31, 2006, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2006 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

                     SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Petroleum & Resources?

Petroleum & Resources Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock's ticker symbol is "PEO" and may be bought and sold through
registered investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to assist you
in this regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan (see page 26).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.peteres.com. The daily NAV is also available
on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XPEOX. The
week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers.

Petroleum's daily trading is shown in the stock tables of many daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "PetRs." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Corporation at
(800) 638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Petroleum stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept in
a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 26.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Petroleum
& Resources?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc., as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Petroleum is simple and is handled through our transfer agent.
The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of transfer. They
will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the transfer agent
stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer agent will send
you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your transfer.

How do I transfer shares held at American Stock Transfer (AST)?

There are many circumstances that require the transfer of shares to new
registrations, e.g., marriage, death, a child reaching the age of maturity, or
giving shares as a gift. Each situation requires different forms of
documentation to support the transfer. You may obtain transfer instructions and
download the necessary forms from our transfer agent's website:
www.amstock.com. Click on Shareholder Services, then General Shareholder
Information and Transfer Instructions.

                                                                             25

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Corporation presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a)
three interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1 and
(b) a "year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the
estimated balance of the net investment income for the year and the net
realized capital gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to
receive the year-end distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this
distribution, all stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement
notice and an election card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
elections by notifying their brokerage house representative.

INVESTORS CHOICE

dividend reinvestment plan, sponsored and administered by our transfer agent,

Item 2. Code of Ethics.

On  June 12, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a code  of

amendments  to  it  nor  have  any  waivers  from  any   its
provisions been granted.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The  board of directors has determined that at least one  of
the  members  of  registrant's  audit  committee  meets  the
definition of audit committee financial expert as that  term

director on the registrant's audit committee whom the  board
of   directors  has  determined  meets  such  definition  is
Kathleen  T.  McGahran,  who  is  independent  pursuant   to
paragraph (a)(2) of this Item.

Item 4.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

     (a)   Audit  Fees.  The aggregate fees for professional
services    rendered    by    its   independent    auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,   for   the   audits   of   the
Corporation's  annual  and semi-annual financial  statements
for 2006 and 2005 were $64,160 and $55,310, respectively.

     (b)   Audit  Related Fees. There were no  audit-related

     (d)   All Other Fees.  The aggregate fees to registrant
by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP other than for  the  services
referenced  above  for 2006 and 2005 were $6,156  and  $800,

Item  6. Schedule of Investments - This schedule is included
as  part of the report to shareholders filed under Item 1 of
this form.

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (Petroleum) follows  long-
standing  general  guidelines for the  voting  of  portfolio
company  proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility
to  vote all such proxies. The portfolio company proxies are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Petroleum uses
its  own  staff of research analysts and portfolio managers.
In  making  the  decision to invest in  a  company  for  the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyses  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options

Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a  staggered  board of directors. In conformance  with  that
policy,  we  will  generally vote in  favor  of  shareholder
proposals to eliminate the staggered election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter  that  can be characterized as blatant anti-takeover
provisions.

With  respect  to  so-called  golden  parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within  the authority of the company's management, under the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually  are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance   with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

(a)  (1) Douglas G. Ober, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer,
     and  President,  and  Joseph M. Truta,  Executive  Vice
     President, comprise  the 2 person  portfolio management
     team for the registrant. Mr.  Ober  and Mr.  Truta have
     served as  portfolio managers for the registrant  since
     1991.  This information is as of February 15, 2007. Mr.
     Ober  is  the lead member of  the  portfolio management
     team.  Mr.  Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  receive   investment
     recommendations  from  a  team of research analysts and
     make decisions jointly about any equity transactions in
     the portfolio. Concurrence of both portfolio   managers
     is  required  for  an  investment  recommendation to be
     approved.

     (2)   Mr.   Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  also  comprise   the
     portfolio   management  team  for   registrant's   non-
     controlled   affiliate,  The  Adams   Express   Company
     (Adams),  a  registered investment company  with  total
     net  assets of $1,377,418,310 as of December 31,  2006.
     Mr.  Ober  is Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  of
     Adams  and Mr. Truta is President. This information  is
     as  of February 15, 2007. The Petroleum fund is a  non-
     diversified  fund  focusing on the energy  and  natural
     resources sectors and Adams is a diversified fund  with
     a   different   focus,  and  there  are  few   material
     conflicts  of  interest that may  arise  in  connection
     with  the portfolio managers' management of both funds.
     The  funds  do  not  buy or sell  securities  or  other
     portfolio   holdings  to  or  from   the   other,   and
     procedures  and  policies are  in  place  covering  the
     sharing  of  expenses and the allocation of  investment
     opportunities,    including    bunched    orders    and
     investments  in initial public offerings,  between  the
     funds.

     (3)   The portfolio managers are compensated through  a
     three-component plan, consisting of salary, annual cash
     incentive    compensation,   and    equity    incentive
     compensation.  The value of each component in any  year
     is  determined by the Compensation Committee, comprised
     solely of independent director members of the Board  of
     Directors.    Salaries   are   determined   by    using
     appropriate industry surveys and information about  the
     local  market as well as general inflation  statistics.
     Cash  incentive compensation is based on a  combination
     of  absolute and relative fund performance over one and
     three  year  periods as well as individual  success  at
     meeting  goals  and  objectives set  by  the  Board  of
     Directors  at  the  beginning  of  each  year.   Target
     incentives are set based on 80% of salary for the Chief
     Executive  Officer and 60% of salary for the  Executive
     Vice President.  Two-thirds of each individual's annual
     cash  incentive  is based on fund performance  and  one
     third  on  individual success.  The  portion  based  on
     performance  is determined using a scale in  which  the
     target   can   be  earned  by  absolute  fund   pre-tax
     performance of 10%.  The scale ranges from zero to 125%
     of  target.  The result is then modified by an  average
     of  the  one  and three year performance  of  the  fund
     relative  to  that of the Dow Jones Oil and  Gas  Index
     (DJOGI) and the S&P 500 Index, with 70% based upon  the
     relative performance of the fund compared to the  DJOGI
     and  30% based on the relative performance compared  to
     the  S&P  500.   Each  one  percent  outperformance  or
     underperformance by the fund adds or  deducts  5%  from
     the  percentage of target earned based  on  the  scale.
     The maximum percentage of target which may be earned is
     200%   and  the  minimum  is  zero.   Equity  incentive
     compensation, based on a plan approved by  shareholders
     in 2005, can take several forms.  Following approval of
     the  plan, grants of restricted stock were made to  the
     portfolio  managers in January 2006,  with  vesting  in
     equal  proportions over a three year period.  The  size
     of  the  grants  was  determined  by  the  Compensation
     Committee   with   the   assistance   of   an   outside
     compensation  consultant.  Grants of  restricted  stock
     were  also made on January 12, 2006, that will vest  at
     the  end  of three years, but only upon the achievement
     of  specified performance criteria; certain percentages
     of  the target number of shares will be deemed to  have
     been  earned based on achieving performance goals  over
     specified intervening time periods.  The benchmark used
     to  measure  performance  is a  hypothetical  portfolio
     comprised of a 80/20 blend of the Dow Jones Oil and Gas
     Index and the S&P 500 Index ("Hypothetical Portfolio").
     The  first one-sixth of the target number of restricted
     shares  would have been earned if, on January 1,  2007,
     the  Corporation's  one year total NAV  return  met  or
     exceeded  the  one  year  total  NAV  return   of   the
     Hypothetical Portfolio.  Because the Corporation's  NAV
     return  trailed that of the Hypothetical  Portfolio  on
     that  date,  only 52.1% of the first one-sixth  of  the
     target  number was earned.  For the next  one-third  of
     the  target  number  of shares, those  shares  will  be
     deemed to have been earned if, on January 1, 2008,  the
     Corporation's  two  year  total  NAV  return  meets  or
     exceeds  that  of  the Hypothetical Portfolio,  with  a
     lesser  percentage  or no shares being  earned  if  the
     Corporation's  total  NAV return  trails  that  of  the
     Hypothetical  Portfolio,  depending  on  the  level  of
     underperformance  on that date.  The remaining  50%  of
     the  target  shares will be deemed to have been  earned
     if,  on  January 1, 2009, the Corporation's three  year
     total   NAV  return  meets  or  exceeds  that  of   the
     Hypothetical Portfolio, with a lesser percentage or  no
     shares  being  earned  if the Corporation's  total  NAV
     return  trails  that  of  the  Hypothetical  Portfolio,
     depending  on  the  level of underperformance  on  that
     date.   In  addition,  if,  on  January  1,  2009,  the
     Corporation's three year total NAV return exceeds  that
     of  the Hypothetical Portfolio, an additional number of
     shares up to 50% of the target number of shares will be
     earned   and   vest   depending   on   the   level   of
     outperformance.  Dividends and capital  gains  paid  on
     the  Corporation's shares of Common Stock ("dividends")
     will  be paid on all of the target number of shares  of
     restricted stock, when such dividends are paid  on  the
     Common Stock, except that no dividends or capital gains
     will  be paid on any shares that are forfeited  due  to
     the   failure  to  achieve  the  performance   criteria
     described above.  The basis for the cash incentive  and
     equity incentive compensation determinations for  Adams
     is  the  same as for Petroleum, except that the portion
     of  the cash incentive based upon fund performance uses
     the  S&P  500 Index as the benchmark, over  a  one  and
     three  year  period, and the benchmark used to  measure
     fund performance for equity incentive compensation is a
     hypothetical  portfolio comprised of a 50/50  blend  of
     the  S&P 500 Index and the Lipper Large Cap Core Mutual
     Fund  Index.   All of the above information  is  as  of
     December 31, 2006, except as noted.

     (4)  Using  a valuation date of December 31, 2006,  Mr.
     Ober  beneficially owns equity securities in registrant
     of over $1,000,000.  Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity
     securities in registrant of over $1,000,000.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 15, 2007, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  13, 2006, the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.
