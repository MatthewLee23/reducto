Comment
..	During the period from November 2004 to April 2005,
the equity portfolio value of the Fund increased by
2.37%.  Over the same period, the TOPIX advanced by
3.93% in USD terms.
..	Japanese Yen ("JPY") terms, the performance of the
Fund, excluding expenses and the Fund's cash
position, was a positive 3.15%, whereas the TOPIX
was up 4.10%.
..	Relative to the TOPIX, the effect of sector
selection was negligible, while stock selection
contributed negatively to the relative performance
(see Table 3).
..	As shown on Table 4, sizable positive contributions
were made by stock selection in the Information &
Communication and Retail sectors, but gains were
more than cancelled out by negative contributions
in the Wholesale Trade, Electric Appliance and Food
sectors.
..	It appears, however, the size effect was the
dominant factor affecting the performance.  The
TOPIX Core 30 Index (index of 30 largest market
capitalization stocks in TOPIX) returned -0.58%
over the six months, while TOPIX Small Index (index
of about 1200 stocks in Tokyo Stock Exchange
("TSE") First Section, excluding the top 500 market
capitalization stocks) returned 14.39%.  The Fund
had a significantly lighter weight in smaller
stocks, as compared to the TOPIX.

Market Review (November 2004 - April 2005)
From the beginning of November 2004 to early April 2005,
the TSE was on a rising trend, gaining roughly 10%, but a
sudden decline in the middle of April wiped out a large part
of the gain over the six months.  The TSE First Section Index
returned 4.75% in U.S. Dollar terms over the six months
(4.71% in Yen terms).  Over a longer-term view, the TSE was
on an up-trend over the year to April 2004, rising from the
800 level to the 1200 level, then mostly stayed in a rather
narrow range between 1100 and 1200.  Over the period, oil
prices remained high.  Oil prices weakened from the $50 per
barrel level at the end of October 2004 to the $40 level in
December, but regained strength to come close to the $60
level at the end of March 2005.  As macro-economic statistics
weakened from strong numbers in early 2004, the government
bond yield declined over the six months from the 1.50% level
to the 1.30% level.  Investors appeared to be cautious about
the U.S. interest rate trend over the period.  Major stock
markets of the world saw a sizable dip in the middle of April
2005.  Nervousness held by investors in the TSE seemed to be
shared by investors in other markets.  In Japan, there was
growing pressure from the investment community on listed
companies to improve shareholder satisfaction.  A rare
attempt at a hostile acquisition supported the trend.
Profitability of listed companies is generally improving, but
the general view is that the pace of improvement from here
will not be as fast as six to twelve months ago.
..	November 04:  The TOPIX was moving in a quite
narrow range over the month, between 1075 and 1130.
The market advanced in the beginning of the month,
as if it welcomed the result of the U.S.
Presidential election.  As the Yen accelerated the
pace of strengthening against the U.S. Dollar, the
market turned weak from the middle of the month.
The TOPIX was at 1085.43 at the end of October,
advanced to 1127.45 on November 16th then declined
and finished the month at 1098.79.  Macro-economic
numbers were not very encouraging.  A quick report
of Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") for the July-
September quarter was +0.3% quarter-on quarter
("QoQ")Retail sales continued to be weak.
Corporate earnings announcements were mixed-some
were as good as expected, but some were
disappointing.  Toyota announced record profit for
the six months to September.  Profits of three
major shipping companies and four large steel
makers over the six months to September doubled
year-on-year ("YoY")Seibu Railway, a railway
operator, was reported to have been making false
reports about its major shareholders' holdings and
in mid-November the TSE de-listed the stock.
Seibu's share price collapsed from Yen1,100+ level to
Yen400 level.
..	December 2004:  The TOPIX started the month from
the 1100 level and had a strong advance in the
latter half of the month, to finish the month with
a 4.63% return.  Selling pressure from individuals,
encouraged by the new tax system, was more than
offset by the unusually high level of foreign
purchases over the holiday season.  The trading
range of the TOPIX has shifted up from the range
between 1070 and 1130 to a range between 1080 and
1150.  The news of the restructuring of Misawa
Homes, the last major company facing financial
difficulties with large bad debt at major banks,
was favorably accepted by the market, helping the
banking sector to push up the whole market.  The
banking sector was the second best performing
sector, after rubber (tire) makers.  Following
Nissan's announcement that it would stop automobile
production because of a steel shortage, other
carmakers made similar announcements.  Sanyo
Electric announced that the damage from the Niigata
earthquake in October would amount to approximately
U.S. $800 million.
..	January 2005:  The TOPIX started the month at the
1150 level and stayed around that level throughout
the month, with monthly a return of -0.30%.  The
TOPIX continued to have low volatility, moving in a
narrow range, roughly between 1130 and 1160.  In
January, smaller stocks fared well.  The TOPIX Core
30 Index, composed of the largest market
capitalization 30 stocks in the TOPIX, returned -
3.22%.  The TOPIX Small Index, composed of stocks
in the TSE First Section excluding the top 500
market capitalization stocks, returned 3.97%.
Other smaller stocks in the TOPIX Second Section
returned 7.97% and the JASDAQ OTC Index returned
5.93%.  Individual investors, who showed a
preference for smaller stocks in the recent past,
appear to have come back to the market as active
participants.  Short-term return-reversal was at
work in January.  Many of the top-performing
sectors in January were bottom-performers in the
previous month.  The Bank of Japan's Tankan
business confidence survey showed a worsened view
by large manufacturing companies.  Companies
started to announce October to December quarterly
results.  Some companies like Canon and Advantest
met expectations.  Pioneer's profit declined 90%
YoY, due to tough market conditions in digital
audio-video products.
..	February 2005:  The TOPIX started the month at the
1150 level and drew an up-trend line to finish the
month at 1177.  The return in February was 2.73% in
Yen terms.  Among TOPIX stocks, the largest
capitalization stocks performed relatively poorly.
The Energy and Materials related sectors continued
to perform well in February.  Top-performing
sectors in February were Mining, Oil & Coal, Steel
and Shipping sectors.  Trading activity was quite
heavy in February.  Oil prices were back on the up-
trend, exceeding the $50 per barrel level.
Dominant news in the month was the attempt by
Livedoor, a small, growing internet service
provider, to take a majority stake in Nippon
Broadcasting System, a radio station that holds a
more than 22% stake in Fuji Television Network, one
of the five major private television stations in
Japan.  The fight for control in Nippon
Broadcasting System and Fuji Television went to the
legal system.  Some companies disappointed
investors in their quarterly earnings announcements
for the October to December period.  Sumitomo Real
Estate decreased its net profit forecast for the
year to March 2005 by half, taking extraordinary
losses in its property holdings.
..	March 2005:  The TOPIX continued its up-trend in
March.  It started the month at 1177.41 and
finished the month at 1182.18.  The return in March
was 0.41% in Yen terms.  Large capitalization
stocks continued to lag.  The TOPIX 100 Index,
composed of the largest 100 market capitalization
stocks in the TOPIX, returned -0.63%.  The TOPIX
Small Index, composed of some 1200 stocks in the
TOPIX excluding the top 500 market capitalization
stocks, performed 2.83%.  The TSE was quite active
in March with heavy volume.  Performances of
individual stocks were rather event-driven.  Top
performers of the month among major stocks included
Fuji Television, involved in the take-over battle
of Nippon Broadcasting, and Sony, which appointed a
new Chairman and President.  Oil prices stayed high
at more than U.S. $50 per barrel level.  GDP growth
for the October to December period were revised
upward to 0.50%.  Some market participants seemed
to expect quite bullish results in national land
price statistics announced in late March.  Land
prices were still falling in Japan, in general, but
the pace of the decline decelerated.
..	April 2005:  The TOPIX corrected by 4.4% in April.
It edged up in the beginning, corrected sharply in
the middle of the month in line with the trend in
other major stock markets in the world, then
stabilized at the end of the month.  After almost a
year-long period with quite limited volatility,
market volatility emerged with downside direction,
as markets in major economies seemed to have shown
nervousness over the economic state of the world in
the near future.  In April 2004, the TOPIX was a
little over 1200 and experienced a sharp correction
of some 150 points.  The TOPIX experienced another
correction in April 2005, from a similar level of
some 100 points.  Among the TOPIX stocks, the
relative weakness of the largest capitalization
stocks continued in April.  The TOPIX 100 Index
returned -4.88%, while the TOPIX Small Index
returned -3.21%.  Return-reversal among sectors
remained effective-Oil & Coal, Rubber Products and
Glass/Cement sectors performed well in April after
poor performance in the previous month.  The
Warehousing, Securities Brokerage and Land
Transportation sectors performed poorly after a
strong performance in the previous month.
Industrial production statistics for March were
disappointing, a decline of 0.30% month-on-month
("MoM"), against a positive consensus estimate.
Retail sales remained weak in March.  The battle
between Livedoor and Fuji Television over the
controlling stake in Nippon Broadcasting came to an
end.  They agreed that Fuji Television will acquire
Nippon Broadcasting shares held by Livedoor with
profits for Livedoor and, that Fuji Television will
buy newly-issued shares of Livedoor Ito-Yokado
announced a merger establishing "Seven and I
Holdings" with Seven-11 and Denny's-the share price
of Seven-11 rose, while that of Ito-Yokado plunged,
because the merger ratio was set preferable to
Seven-11.  Recently announced corporate results
were mixed.  Commodity-related companies, such as
bulk-chemical producers, steel producers and
trading houses, announced good results and made up-
beat indications for the near future.  Most of
retailers continued to suffer.  Results of auto
makers were generally good, while those from
technology companies were not encouraging.
Outlook
The state of the Japanese economy improved significantly
over the past two years.  The worries surrounded the shape of
Japanese economy and Japanese companies disappeared or
lessened significantly in the recent past.  It appears that
investor worries about major bank failure in Japan have
vanished.  Large troubled companies like Daiei and Kanebo
were assisted by a government-aided organization.
Bankruptcies have been declining.  GDP recorded growth.
Blue-chip companies are reporting record profits.  Looking at
Japanese companies, there has been significant improvement in
the fundamentals because many of them have gone through tough
restructurings.  Blue-chip players like Toyota, Canon and
ShinEstu Chemical are steadily expanding and have reported
record profits.  Natural resource-related companies, such as
oil distributors, steel makers and trading houses active in
metals and commodities, enjoyed price hikes and improved
profitability significantly.  Deflation pressure remains,
with still-declining land prices (though much decelerated)
and weak retail sales statistics, but it is not regarded as a
major threat to the economy and companies in general.
The Japanese economy has returned to a normal state and
companies listed here are operating in a normal environment.
On this background, we expect fundamentals of individual
companies to more favorably influence share price
performance, compared with the recent past.  The market trend
seems to be changing from favoring certain sectors as a whole
(like steel, shipping and wholesale trade, over the recent
past) to being selective in individual sectors.  We will keep
a careful eye on the developments at the companies held in
the portfolio and at investment candidates.  Our focus on the

Notes to Financial Statements
Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
The Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was
incorporated in Maryland on July 12, 1990 under its former
name "The Japan Emerging Equity Fund, Inc." and commenced
operations on July 24, 1992It is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as a closed-end,
diversified management investment company.
The following significant accounting policies are in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States of America for investment companies.  Such
policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements.  The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Actual
reporting results could differ from those estimates.
Valuation of Investments-Securities which are listed on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange or listed on the over-the-counter
market in Japan or listed on other exchanges in Japan and for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at
the last reported sales price available to the Fund at the
close of business on the day the securities are being valued
or, lacking any such sales, at the last available bid price
In instances where quotations are not readily available or
where the price as determined by the above procedures is
deemed not to represent fair market value, fair value will be
determined in such manner as the Board of Directors (the
"Board") may prescribe Short-term investments having a
maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost,
except where the Board determines that such valuation does
not represent the fair value of the investment.  All other
securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined
in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board.
Foreign Currency Translation-The books and records of
the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1) the
foreign currency market value of investment securities and
other assets and liabilities stated in Japanese yen are
translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the
period; and (2) purchases, sales, income and expenses are
translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
respective dates of such transactions.  The resulting
exchange gains and losses are included in the Statement of
Operations.  The Fund does not isolate the effect of
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from the effect of
fluctuations in the market price of securities.
Tax Status-The Fund intends to continue to distribute
substantially all of its taxable income and to comply with
the minimum distribution and other requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies  Accordingly, no provision for federal income or
excise taxes is required.
The Fund is not subject to any Japanese income, capital
gains or other taxes except for withholding taxes on certain
income, generally imposed at rates of 10% on interest and
dividends, paid to the Fund by Japanese corporations.
Investment Transactions and Investment Income-Investment
transactions are recorded on the trade date (the date upon
which the order to buy or sell is executed)Realized and
unrealized gains and losses from security and foreign
currency transactions are calculated on the identified cost
basis.  Dividend income and corporate actions are recorded
generally on the ex-date, except for certain dividends and
corporate actions from Japanese securities which may be
recorded after the ex-date, as soon as the Fund acquires
information regarding such dividends or corporate actions.
Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders-The Fund
records dividends and distributions payable to its
shareholders on the ex-dividend date.  The amount of
dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with
federal income tax regulations, which may differ from
generally accepted accounting principles.  These book
basis/tax basis differences are either considered temporary
or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the
capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require reclassifications.
Dividends and distributions which exceed net investment
income and net realized capital gains for tax purposes are
reported as distributions of paid-in-capital.
Investment Manager and Investment Adviser
The Fund has an Investment Management Agreement with
Daiwa SB Investments (U.S..A.) Ltd.(the "Manager")Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd.("DSBI" or the "Adviser"), an affiliate of
the Manager, acts as the Fund's investment adviser pursuant
to an Investment Advisory Agreement between the Manager and
DSBIF.  For such investment services, the Fund is obligated
to pay the Manager a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.60%
of the first $20 million, 0.40% of the next $30 million and
0.20% of the excess over $50 million of the Fund's average
weekly net assets, of which fee 60% is paid by the Manager to
DSBI.  In addition, the Fund has agreed to reimburse the
Manager and the Adviser for all out-of-pocket expenses
related to the Fund.  For the six months ended April 30,
2005, there were no out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Manager or the Adviser.
At April 30, 2005, the Fund owed $26,774 to the Manager.
Brokerage commissions of $13,896 were paid by the Fund
to Daiwa Securities America, Inc., an affiliate of both the
Manager and DSBI, in connection with portfolio transactions
during the six months ended April 30, 2005.
Administrator and Custodian and Other Related Parties
Daiwa Securities Trust Company ("DSTC"), an affiliate of
the Adviser, provides certain administrative services to the
Fund, for which the Fund pays to DSTC a monthly fee at an
annual rate of 0.20% of the first $60 million of the Fund's
average weekly net assets, 0.15% of the next $40 million and
0.10% of the excess over $100 million, with a minimum annual
fee of $120,000.  In addition, as permitted by the
Administration Agreement, the Fund reimburses the
Administrator for its out-of-pocket expenses related to the
Fund.  For the six months ended April 30, 2005, expenses of
$4,500 were paid or accrued to the Administrator,
representing reimbursement to the Administrator of costs
relating to the attendance by its employees at meetings of
the Fund's Board.
DSTC also acts as custodian for the Fund's assets and
has appointed Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the "Sub-
Custodian"), an affiliate of the Manager, to act as the sub-
custodian for all of the cash and securities of the Fund held
in Japan.  As compensation for its services as custodian,
DSTC receives a monthly fee and reimbursement of out-of-
pocket expenses.  Such expenses include fees and out-of-
