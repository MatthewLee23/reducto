R. JAY GERKEN, CFA

Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Shareholder,

The performance of the high-yield bond market(i) over the six months ending
March 31, 2004, was spurred by an improving economy, which benefited from a
mid-year cut in interest rates. Strong inflows into high-yield bond funds
throughout much of the period drove demand for high-yield bonds, propelling the
market higher through the end of December. Better-than-expected quarterly
earnings and lower default rates also contributed to this strong demand, while
increased capital market transactions fortified the balance sheets of corporate
bond issuers. Although the market's tone was more tempered in 2004 than it had
been in the final quarter of 2003, as of the period's close, corporate
fundamentals have remained strong and yields on high-yield issues finished
significantly above those on higher-rated bonds.

During the six months ended March 31, 2004 the High Income Opportunity Fund
Inc., returned 5.28% based on its New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") market price,
and 7.49% based on its net asset value ("NAV")(ii) per share. In comparison, the
Citigroup High Yield Market Index ("High Yield Index")(iii) returned 8.33% over
the same period. The fund's Lipper high current yield closed-end funds category
average returned 8.83% over the same time frame.(iv) Please note that Lipper
performance returns are based on each fund's NAV.

During this six-month period, the fund made distributions to shareholders
totaling $0.30 per share. The performance table shows the fund's 30-day SEC
yields as well as its six-month total return based on its NAV and market price
as of March 31, 2004. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The
fund's yields will vary. Please note that high-yield bonds are subject to
additional risks, such as the increased risk of default and greater volatility
because of the lower credit quality of these issues.

All figures represent past performance and are not a guarantee of future
results. The fund's yields will vary.

Total returns are based on changes in NAV or market price, respectively. Total
returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional shares. The "SEC yield" is a return figure
often quoted by bond and other fixed income mutual funds. This quotation is
based on the most recent 30-day (or one month) period covered by the fund's
filings with the SEC. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest
earned during the period after deduction of the fund's expenses for the period.
These yields are as of March 31, 2004 and are subject to change.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests and
investigations.

available in most newspapers under the NYSE listings. The daily NAV is available

In addition, the fund issues a quarterly press release that can be found on most
major financial web sites as well as www.citigroupassetmanagement.com.

The information provided is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a
guarantee of future results or investment advice. Views expressed may differ
from those of the firm as a whole.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of March 31, 2004 and are subject to
change. Please refer to pages 5 through 19 for a list and percentage breakdown
of the fund's holdings.

All index performance reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes. Please
note that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.

(i)   RISKS: The fund invests in high yield bonds, which are subject to
      additional risks such as the increased risk of default and greater
      volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. The fund may
      use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may
      disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on
      fund performance. In addition, it may invest in foreign securities, which
      are subject to certain risks of overseas investing including currency
      fluctuations and changes in political and economic conditions, which could
      result in significant market fluctuations.
(ii)  NAV is a price that reflects the value of the fund's underlying portfolio
      plus other assets, less the fund's liabilities. However, the price at
      which an investor may buy or sell shares of the fund is at the fund's
      market price as determined by supply of and demand for the fund's common
      shares, which may be more or less than the fund's NAV.
(iii) The Citigroup High Yield Market Index is a broad-based unmanaged index of
      high yield securities.
(iv)  Lipper, Inc. is a major independent mutual-fund tracking organization.
      Returns are based on the six-month period ended March 31, 2004 calculated
      among the eight funds in the fund's Lipper category including the
      reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!

As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your dividends
and capital gains distributions, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below
is a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary

If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of common stock shares in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a cash
dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value ("NAV") per share on the
determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a price reflecting
the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than the NAV at the time of valuation (the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC Inc. ("Plan Agent") will buy common
stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the NAV previously
determined before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt to
terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95% of
the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will be
based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open
market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in the section of this
report beginning on page 31. To find out more detailed information about the
Plan and about how you can participate, please call the Plan Agent at
1-800-331-1710.

Bond Ratings (unaudited)
================================================================================

The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

AAA      -- Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
            Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
            strong.
AA       -- Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
            repay principal and differ from the highest rated issue only in a
            small degree.
A        -- Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
            principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
            effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
            bonds in higher rated categories.
BBB      -- Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
            interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate
            protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing
            circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay
            interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for
            bonds in higher rated categories.
BB, B,   -- Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC", "CC" and "C" are regarded, on balance,
CCC, CC     as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay
and C       interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the
            obligation. "BB" represents the lowest degree of speculation and "C"
            the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds will likely have
            some quality and protective characteristics, these are outweighed by
            large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions.
D        -- Bonds rated "D" are in default, and payment of interest and/or
            repayment of principal is in arrears.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 may be
applied to each generic rating from "Aa" to "Caa", where 1 is the highest and 3
the lowest rating within its generic category.

Aa       -- Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
            Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are generally known
            as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds
            because margins of protection may not be as large in "Aaa"
            securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater
            amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the
            long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa" securities.
A        -- Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and are
            to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving
            security to principal and interest are considered adequate but
            elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment
            some time in the future.
Baa      -- Bonds rated "Baa" are considered to be medium grade obligations;
            that is, they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
            Interest payment and principal security appear adequate for the
            present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
            characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. These
            bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
            speculative characteristics as well.
Ba       -- Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
            future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of
            interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby
            not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future.
            Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.
B        -- Bonds rated "B" generally lack characteristics of desirable
            investments. Assurance of interest and principal payments or
            maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of
            time may be small.
Caa      -- Bonds rated "Caa" are of poor standing. These issues may be in
            default, or there may be present elements of danger with respect to
            principal or interest.
Ca       -- Bonds rated "Ca" represent obligations which are speculative in a
            high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked
            shortcomings.
C        -- Bonds rated "C" are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
            rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever
            attaining any real investment standing.
NR       -- Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's or
            Moody's.

1.    Significant Accounting Policies

The High Income Opportunity Fund Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company.

The following are significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund and are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"): (a) security transactions are accounted for on trade date; (b)
securities are valued at the mean between the quoted bid and asked prices
provided by an independent pricing service that are based on transactions in
corporate obligations, quotations from corporate bond dealers, market
transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between
securities; securities listed on the NASDAQ National Market System for which
market quotations are available are valued at the official closing price or, if
there is no official closing price on that day, at the last sale price; (c)
securities for which market quotations are not available will be valued in good
faith at fair value by or under the direction of the Board of Directors; (d)
securities maturing within 60 days are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or
minus amortized premium, which approximates value; (e) gains or losses on the
sale of securities are calculated by using the specific identification method;
(f) dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date; foreign dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date or as soon as practical after the Fund
determines the existence of a dividend declaration after exercising reasonable
due diligence; (g) interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and
accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis; (h) dividends and
distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date; the Fund
distributes dividends monthly and capital gains, if any, at least annually; (i)
the accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars. All assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars
based on the rate of exchange of such currencies against U.S. dollars on the
date of valuation. Purchases and sales of securities, and income and expenses
are translated at the rate of exchange quoted on the respective date that such
transactions are recorded. Differences between income or expense amounts
recorded and collected or paid are adjusted when reported by the custodian bank;
(j) the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in
accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America; (k) the Fund
intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make
distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all
Federal income and excise taxes; and (l) estimates and assumptions are

<PAGE>

================================================================================
Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
================================================================================

required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets
resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the
economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in
determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

The Fund may also enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to
hedge against foreign currency risk. These contracts are marked-to-market daily
by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current
market rate as an unrealized gain or loss. Realized gains or losses are
recognized when contracts are settled or offset by entering into another forward
foreign exchange contract.

In addition, the Fund invests in high-yield instruments that are subject to
certain credit and market risks. The yields of high-yield debt obligations
reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's investment in
securities rated below investment grade typically involve risks not associated
with higher rated securities including, among others, greater risk of timely and
ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater market price volatility and
less liquid secondary market trading.

2.    Management Agreement

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager of the Fund. The
Fund pays SBFM a management fee calculated at an annual rate of 1.15% of the
Fund's average daily net assets. This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

3.    Investments

During the six months ended March 31, 2004, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

================================================================================
Purchases                                                            $78,885,376

At March 31, 2004, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation

Gross unrealized appreciation                                      $ 57,911,325

Net unrealized appreciation                                        $ 29,938,164
================================================================================

4.    Repurchase Agreements

When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the Fund's policy that a
custodian takes possession of the underlying collateral securities, the value of
which at least equals the principal amount of the repurchase transaction,
including accrued interest. To the extent that any repurchase transaction
exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is marked-to-market to
ensure the adequacy of the collateral. If the seller defaults and the value of
the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect
to the seller of the security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be
delayed or limited.

5.    Capital Shares

Capital stock transactions were as follows:

6.    Additional Information

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue guarantee
agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor would
guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue Guarantee
Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the sub-contractor's
business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent (PFPC Inc.) used by

Agreement was amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements
that included a one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards informed of
the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when that occurred.

CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
approximately $17 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received
from the Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. CAM also plans an
independent review to verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were
fairly priced as compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new
procedures and making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are
entered into in the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

(1)   For the six months ended March 31, 2004 (unaudited).
(2)   Per share amounts have been calculated using the monthly average shares
      method.
(3)   Effective October 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in the accounting
      method that requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all
      discounts. Without the adoption of this change, for the year ended
      September 30, 2002, the net investment income, net realized and unrealized
      loss and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets would
      have been $0.68, $(0.98) and 10.13%, respectively. Per share information,
      ratios and supplemental data for the periods prior to October 1, 2001 have
      not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

================================================================================
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited)
================================================================================

Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose shares
of Common Stock are registered in his own name will have all distributions from
the Fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), as purchasing agent
under the Plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. Distributions
with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer or other
nominee (that is, in "street name") will be reinvested by the broker or nominee
in additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the
broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash.
Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult their
broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of PFPC as dividend
paying agent.

The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the Plan in
lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the market
price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value ("NAV") per
share of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the record date
for the distribution), the Plan participants will be issued shares of common
stock by the Fund at a price equal to the greater of NAV determined as described
below or 95% of the market price of the common stock.

If the market price of the common stock is less than the NAV of the common stock
at the time of valuation (which is the close of business on the determination
date) PFPC will buy common stock in the open market, on the stock exchange or
elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following the commencement of the
purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds
the NAV of the common stock as of the valuation time, PFPC will attempt to
terminate purchases in the open market and cause the Fund to issue the remaining
portion of the dividend or distribution in shares at a price equal to the
greater of (a) NAV as of the valuation time or (b) 95% of the then current
market price. In this case, the number of shares received by a Plan participant
will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the
open market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares. To the
extent PFPC is unable to stop open market purchases and cause the Fund to issue
the remaining shares, the average per share purchase price paid by PFPC may
exceed the NAV of the common stock as of the valuation time, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or capital gains distribution
had been paid in common stock issued by the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC
will begin to purchase common stock on the open market as soon as practicable
after the determination date for the dividend or capital gains distribution, but
in no event shall such purchases continue later than 30 days after the payment
date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for a succeeding
dividend or distribution, except when necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of the federal securities laws.

================================================================================
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)
================================================================================

PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmation of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve Plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each Plan participant will be held
by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of each Plan participant.

Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and capital
gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the Fund. No brokerage
charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the Fund
under the Plan. Each Plan participant will, however, bear a proportionate share
of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with respect to any open market
purchases made under the Plan.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to Plan participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence, RI
02940-3027 or by telephone at 1-800-331-1710.

                        --------------------------------

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, that from time to time the Fund may purchase,
at market price, shares of its common stock in the open market.

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available without charge,
upon request, by telephoning the Fund (toll-free) at 1-800-451-2010 and by

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to
         develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the
         Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM"), a
         group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup, Inc.
         ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers that comprise
         CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and
         procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the Manager votes proxies
         relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients.

         In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
         principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest
         of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could
         affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner
         that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
         shareholder values. The Manager may utilize an external service
         provider to provide it with information and/or a recommendation with
         regard to proxy votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
         Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

         In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in
         the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated
         position. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
         principles set forth above and considering such enumerated factors. In
         the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated position or list
         of factors that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a
         case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles set forth
         above. Issues for which there is a stated position set forth in the
         Policies or for which there is a list of factors set forth in the
         Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall into a
         variety of categories, including election of directors, ratification of
         auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses, capital structure issues,
         executive and director

<PAGE>

         compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings, and social and
         environmental issues. The stated position on an issue set forth in the
         Policies can always be superseded, subject to the duty to act solely in
         the best interest of the beneficial owners of accounts, by the
         investment management professionals responsible for the account whose
         shares are being voted. Issues applicable to a particular industry may
         cause CAM to abandon a policy that would have otherwise applied to
         issuers generally. As a result of the independent investment advisory
         services provided by distinct CAM business units, there may be
         occasions when different business units or different portfolio managers
         within the same business unit vote differently on the same issue.

         In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
         interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
         identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the
         Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on
         behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
         periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the
         Manager) in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware
         of the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting
         proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
         relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise during
         the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring
         conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
         compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a list
         of significant relationships that could present a conflict of interest
         for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the
         fact that a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and
         a non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner
         in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such
         issuer. Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized
         non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for prudential
         reasons treats as a potential conflict of interest because such
         relationship might appear to the public to influence the manner in
         which the Manager decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes
         the position that non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and an issuer
         (e.g. investment banking or banking) do not present a conflict of
         interest for the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer.
         Such position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
         independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as well
         as on the existence of information barriers between the Manager and
         certain other Citigroup business units.

         CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
         are members, to review and address conflicts of interest brought to its
         attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that will be voted in
         accordance with a stated position on an issue or in accordance with the
         recommendation of an independent third party is not brought to the
         attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of interest
         review because the Manager's position is that to the extent a conflict
         of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in accordance with a
         pre-determined policy or in accordance with the recommendation of an
         independent third party. With respect to a conflict of interest brought
         to its attention, the

<PAGE>

         Proxy Voting Committee first determines whether such conflict of
         interest is material. A conflict of interest is considered material to
         the extent that it is determined that such conflict is likely to
         influence, or appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making in
         voting proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that
         a conflict of interest is not material, the Manager may vote proxies
         notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
         determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
         before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
         determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
         including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
         conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
         interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict
         to clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
         clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
         behalf.

ITEM 9.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

         (a)      The registrant's principal executive officer and principal
                  financial officer have concluded that the registrant's
                  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-
                  3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
                  "1940 Act")) are effective as of a date within 90 days of the
                  filing date of this report that includes the disclosure
                  required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of the
                  disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b)
                  under the 1940 Act and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange
                  Act of 1934.

         (b)      There were no changes in the registrant's internal control
                  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under
                  the 1940 Act) that occurred during the registrant's last
                  fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in
                  the case of an annual report) that have materially affected,
                  or are likely to materially affect the registrant's internal
                  control over financial reporting.
