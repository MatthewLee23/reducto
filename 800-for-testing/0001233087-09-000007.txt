                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management
                            groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

Annual Report

Franklin Templeton
Limited Duration Income Trust

YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent it is possible and consistent with the
Fund's primary objective, through a portfolio consisting primarily of high yield
corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans and mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities.

Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust covers
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the year under review, Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust had
cumulative total returns of -14.17% based on net asset value and -9.97% based on
market price. Net asset value decreased from $12.85 per share on March 31, 2008,
to $10.15 at period-end, and the market price fell from $10.94 to $8.92 over the
same time. You can find the Fund's performance data in the Performance Summary
on page 8.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2009, economic conditions deteriorated. The
Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to an all-time low since

it began in 1967 as the U.S. economy faltered and as stock markets declined. The
government's abrupt conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the
failure of several blue-chip banks and financial institutions roiled equity
markets. Despite far-reaching government interventions, the nation's economic
troubles worsened as manufacturing activity weakened at its fastest pace in
nearly 30 years and as home prices fell at an accelerated rate. Jobless claims
mounted and the unemployment rate rose to 8.5% by period-end.(1) Economic
growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), rose at a 2.8% annualized
pace in the second quarter, largely due to strong exports and government
spending. However, in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, GDP fell at
annualized rates of 0.5% and 6.3%, reflecting a broad-based slowdown in consumer
spending, corporate profits and export growth.(2) GDP continued to slow in the
first quarter of 2009 and registered an estimated annualized 6.1% rate of
decline.(2)

Oil prices retreated dramatically from $102 per barrel at the beginning of the
period to $50 by period-end. Many other commodities and industrial metals
followed similar trends. Partially as a result of the steep price corrections,
March's inflation rate was an annualized -0.4%, the first 12-month decline since
August 1955.(1) Core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, rose at a
1.8% annualized rate, which was within the Federal Reserve Board's (Fed's)
informal target range of 1.5%-2.0%.(1) The core personal consumption
expenditures price index reported a 12-month increase of 1.8%.(2)

A slowing economy and decelerating inflation prompted policymakers to further
lower interest rates and enact stimulus plans. During the year under review, the
Fed lowered the federal funds target rate to a range of 0% to 0.25% from 2.25%
at the start of the reporting period. Congress passed a $787 billion fiscal
stimulus package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) that included tax
breaks, money for ailing state governments, aid to the poor and unemployed, and
spending on infrastructure, renewable energy, health care and education. The Fed
and U.S. Treasury Department also introduced new programs designed to shore up
beleaguered banks' capital, enable freer lending to businesses and consumers and
help struggling home buyers avoid foreclosure.

Treasury prices soared for much of the period but began to decline in the latter
half. Investors drove the yield on the three-month Treasury bill to a
multi-decade low, and LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), the rate banks
charge one

another for loans, jumped to record highs in September. Fixed income spreads
were generally wide relative to Treasury yields over the period due to
heightened market turbulence and risk aversion. The yield spread between the
two-year and the 10-year Treasury yields rose slightly to 190 basis points (100
basis points equal one percentage point) at the end of March from 183 basis
points at the beginning of the reporting period. The two-year Treasury bill
yield fell from 1.62% to 0.81% over the 12-month period. Over the same period,
the 10-year Treasury note yield fell from 3.45% to 2.71%.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's fiscal year was marked by one of the worst financial crises and
overall economic environments in modern history. The economy remained mired in
recession for the entirety of the Fund's fiscal year, largely the result of a
severe credit crunch that followed the bursting of the housing market bubble.
While high-profile victims of the economic crisis included banks and other
financial firms, problems in nonfinancial sectors also steadily grew as the
recession broadened in scope. The manufacturing sector faced big challenges
against a backdrop of fading domestic and foreign demand, and the Institute for
Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index registered sub-50 readings
throughout the year under review. (A reading below 50 signals a contraction, and
the ISM's gauge has been below that level since February 2008.)

U.S. stocks fell sharply and endured a deep bear market until early March 2009,
and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) had a -38.09% total return for the
year under review.(3) Investors flocked to safe-haven U.S. Treasury securities
as they sought alternatives to stocks and riskier debt securities. Treasuries
became the top-performing asset class, and their prices rose, driving yields
sharply lower. In a decelerating economic environment, asset classes exposed to
the deteriorating fortunes of corporate America -- namely high yield corporate
bonds and leveraged loan securities -- suffered heavy losses due to rising
defaults and lowered credit quality. Meanwhile, mortgage-backed securities
benefited somewhat from their higher quality nature, as well as from a wave of
government actions intended to improve the flow of credit between banks and the
real economy.

Within the credit portion of the Fund's portfolio, we reduced our exposure to
bank loans as they rebounded in early 2009 when liquidity and credit market
conditions improved somewhat. We used the proceeds to increase the Fund's
exposure to high yield corporate bonds. We also increased our exposure to
investment-grade corporate bonds, as securities within this higher-quality asset
class appeared cheap by historical standards. Our exposure to mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities also increased slightly, mostly due to their
relative outperformance in the market versus the Fund's other asset types. Below
you will find further details of activity within the Fund's three primary asset
classes: high yield corporate bonds, floating rate bank loan securities, and
mortgage-and other asset-backed securities.

HIGH YIELD CORPORATE BONDS

High yield corporate bonds had a -19.55% total return during the Fund's fiscal
year, according to the Credit Suisse (CS) High Yield Index.(4) The brunt of the
pain was felt during the fall of 2008, as credit markets seized up following
several prominent Wall Street bankruptcies or bailouts, leading to widespread
expectations for a dramatic rise in defaults, especially among the least
credit-worthy entities. Indeed, default rates escalated due to a combination of
the weak economy and lack of available credit to refinance debt. Many companies
were also at risk of violating the covenants of loans that were taken out during

more prosperous economic times, leading to expectations for even more defaults.
In this difficult environment, high yield debt securities' yield spreads over
Treasuries widened to more than 18 percentage points in November 2008 from
around 8 percentage points at the beginning of the Fund's fiscal year, before
narrowing to about 15 percentage points by period-end as credit conditions eased
slightly.(5) Thus, valuations were cheap compared to the 15-year average spread
of around six percentage points.(5) Given the attractive valuations, we
increased the Fund's exposure to high yield bonds somewhat.

FLOATING RATE BANK LOANS

During the Fund's fiscal year, the bank loan asset class had a -19.00% return as
measured by the CS Leveraged Loan Index.(6) Returns were extremely volatile,
especially in the period's latter half, fluctuating from a record quarterly loss
of 22.93% for fourth quarter 2008 as the credit crunch took hold, to a record
high quarterly gain of 7.17% in first quarter 2009 as much more favorable
technical conditions ignited a strong rally.(6)

As the year progressed, the bank loan market outlook weakened as corporate
earnings declined and loan defaults accelerated. Liquidity remained extremely
tight and the overall credit markets essentially shut down in fourth quarter
2008. As a result, secondary loan prices fell to an all-time low of 63 cents on
the dollar average bid price on December 16, 2008, before rebounding to 75 cents
on the dollar on March 31, 2009.(7) The average discounted spread to maturity
(the interest rate margin over LIBOR, factoring the current trading price and
the loan's maturity) widened to near an all-time high of approximately the LIBOR
rate plus 1,000 basis points at the end of December 2008, as measured by the S&P
Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) Leveraged Loan Index (LLI).(8)
The loan market was also noticeably bifurcated, with investors gravitating
toward higher quality performing loans. For example, according to the S&P LSTA
LLI, BB-rated loans were mostly stronger while CCC-rated securities steadily
weakened through period-end.(8)

<PAGE>

During the Fund's fiscal year, the bank loan default rate surged to 4.7% and
8.0% -- by number of loans and principal amount, respectively, according to S&P
Leveraged Commentary and Data.(7) Despite the increase in defaults, the bank
loan market rallied toward period-end, bolstered by higher cash balances from
loan repayments and buybacks, together with modest inflows. However, for their
short to intermediate-term outlook, many bank loan investors remained cautious
as corporate fundamentals declined and loan defaults continued to rise.

MORTGAGE- AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

The Fund's mortgage-backed securities (MBS) generally outperformed the high
yield corporate and bank loan sectors. Market conditions were supportive for
agency MBS, as the Fed announced it would purchase agency mortgages as part of
its quantitative easing policy. We continued to believe MBS offered relative
value and felt the Fed's MBS buyback program would likely support valuations
over the near term. Toward period-end, the asset-backed securities (ABS) sector
showed some signs of stability relative to U.S. Treasuries, a reversal from the
historic volatility the sector experienced though much of the Fund's fiscal
year. The government's implementation of the Term ABS Lending Facility (TALF)
lent support to consumer-based ABS, and spreads generally tightened as this
program gained momentum.

The decline in Treasury and MBS rates, coupled with the Fed's announcement that
it would be purchasing up to $1.25 trillion in agency MBS, increased prepayment
risk among higher coupon MBS. Since these factors were introduced into the
market, we reduced the Fund's allocation to some higher coupon MBS in favor of
lower coupon MBS. We remained allocated to higher quality securitized sectors
with strong credit fundamentals, specifically those related to commercial real
estate. Furthermore, the Fund's allocations were generally AAA-rated securities
that are high in the capital structure and benefit from high levels of credit
protection.

Performance Summary as of 3/31/09

Your dividend income will vary depending on dividends or interest paid by
securities in the Fund's portfolio, adjusted for operating expenses. Capital
gain distributions are net profits realized from the sale of portfolio
securities. Total return reflects reinvestment of the Fund's dividends and
capital gain distributions, if any, and any unrealized gains or losses. Total
returns do not reflect any sales charges paid at inception or brokerage
commissions paid on secondary market purchases. The performance table does not
reflect any taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund dividends, capital gain
distributions, if any, or any realized gains on the sale of Fund shares.

PERFORMANCE DATA REPRESENT PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE
RESULTS. INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND YOU MAY HAVE
A GAIN OR LOSS WHEN YOU SELL YOUR SHARES. CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY DIFFER FROM
FIGURES SHOWN.

ENDNOTES

INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS WILL AFFECT THE FUND'S SHARE
PRICE AND YIELD. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER-YIELDING, LOWER-RATED
SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT AND LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.

(1.) Figures are for common shares. As of March 31, 2009, the Trust had leverage
     in the amount of 34.45% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust employs
     leverage through the issuance of Auction Preferred Shares and purchase of
     Mortgage Dollar Rolls. The use of financial leverage creates an opportunity
     for increased income but, at the same time, creates special risks
     (including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and
     market price of common shares). The cost of leverage rises and falls with
     changes in short-term interest rates. Such increases/decreases in the cost
     of the Trust's leverage may be offset by increased/decreased income from
     the Trust's floating rate investments.

(2.) Total return calculations represent the cumulative and average annual
     changes in value of an investment over the periods indicated.

(3.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions at net asset value.

(4.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions based on the dividend reinvestment
     plan.

(5.) Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the Fund's 7.6 cent per
     share March dividend and the NYSE Amex closing price of $8.92 on 3/31/09.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Plan) offers you a prompt and simple way
to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions (Distributions) in shares
of the Fund. PNC Global Investment Servicing (Agent), P.O. Box 6006, Stream
Carol, IL 60197-6006, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in
administering the Plan. The Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in
the same name as your outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and
Conditions of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained
from the Fund at the address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.


                               10 | Annual Report
<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American Stock Exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the


                               Annual Report | 11


<PAGE>

acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to
your account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will
adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of
shares at the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at (800) 331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (Fund) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities, government securities, mortgage pass-through
securities, other mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage
obligations and asset-backed securities generally trade in the over-the-counter
market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may utilize independent
pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services may use valuation models or matrix
pricing which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note
transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities
that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate
and maturity date, option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections,
interest rate spreads and yield curves, to determine current value.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis, to determine
current value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A. SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment
and delivery scheduled for a future date. These transactions are subject to
market fluctuations and are subject to the risk that the value at delivery may
be more or less than the trade date purchase price. Although the Fund will
generally purchase these securities with the intention of holding the
securities, it may sell the securities before the settlement date. Sufficient
assets have been segregated for these securities.

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
appreciation or depreciation on the contracts, as measured by the difference
between the contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at
the reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund may enter into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a TBA basis.
Mortgage dollar rolls are agreements between the Fund and a financial
institution to simultaneously sell and repurchase mortgage-backed securities at
a future date. Gains or losses are realized on the initial sale, and the
difference between the repurchase price and the sale price is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss to the Fund upon entering into the mortgage dollar roll.
In addition, the Fund may invest the cash proceeds that are received from the
initial sale. During the period between the sale and repurchase, the Fund is not
entitled to principal and interest paid on the mortgage-backed securities. The
risks of mortgage dollar roll transactions include the potential inability of
the counterparty to fulfill its obligations.

The Fund is investing in mortgage dollar rolls as an alternate form of leverage.
As a result, the mortgage dollar rolls are considered indebtedness or a "senior
security" for purposes of the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.

F. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

G. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of March 31, 2009, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.

H. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined
according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings
determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are
reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent
periods.

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At March 31, 2009, there were 28,290,000 common shares authorized (without par
value). During the year ended March 31, 2009, there were no shares issued; all
reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously issued shares purchased
in the open market. During the year ended March 31, 2008, there were 34,261
shares issued for $490,071 from reinvested distributions.

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003 the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. During the year
ended March 31, 2009, there was a pro rata preferred redemption of each series
totaling 4,000 shares and $100,000,000 leaving 1,200 Preferred Shares Series M,
1,200 Preferred Shares Series W and 1,200 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference totaling $90,000,000. Dividends to preferred
shareholders are cumulative and are declared weekly, at rates established
through an auction process. The weekly auctions for Series M, W and F have all
failed during the fiscal year 2009; consequently, the dividend rate paid on the
Preferred Shares has moved to the maximum rate as defined in the prospectus.
During the year ended March 31, 2009, the dividends on Preferred Shares ranged
from 1.48% to 5.94%.

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES (CONTINUED)

The Fund is required to maintain, on a weekly basis, a specified discounted
value of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch
Ratings and Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset
coverage for the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the year ended March 31, 2009, all requirements were met.

4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Franklin Resources, Inc. is the holding company for various subsidiaries that
together are referred to as Franklin Templeton Investments. Certain officers and
trustees of the Fund are also officers and/or directors of the following
subsidiaries:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

The Fund pays an investment management fee and administrative fee to Advisers
and FT Services of 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively, per year of the average daily
managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the Fund's gross asset value minus
the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the liquidation value of the
Preferred Shares and other financial leverage.

5. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2009, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

6. INCOME TAXES

For tax purposes, capital losses may be carried over to offset future capital
gains, if any. At March 31, 2009, the capital loss carryforwards were as
follows:

</TABLE>

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of defaulted securities, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, payments-in-kind, and bond
discounts and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, and bond discounts and
premiums.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
year ended March 31, 2009, aggregated $948,675,545 and $958,804,737,
respectively.

8. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative
fees paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

At March 31, 2009, net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on offsetting
forward exchange contracts was as follows:

</TABLE>

10. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES

The Fund has 59.36% of its portfolio invested in high yield, senior secured
floating rate notes, or other securities rated below investment grade. These
securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price
volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default
than higher rated securities.

The Fund held defaulted securities and/or other securities for which the income
has been deemed uncollectible. At March 31, 2009, the aggregate value of these
securities was $5,964,771, representing 1.46% of the Fund's portfolio. The Fund
discontinues accruing income on securities for which income has been deemed
uncollectible and provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable. The
securities have been identified on the accompanying Statement of Investments.

11. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrowers' discretion. Funded portions of credit agreements are presented on the
Statement of Investments.

At March 31, 2009, unfunded commitments were as follows:

12. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Officers, directors or employees of the Fund's Investment Manager, may serve
from time to time as members of bondholders' steering committees or official
creditors' committees. Such participation may result in the possession by the
Investment Manager of material non-public information which, pursuant to the
Fund's policies and the requirements of applicable securities laws, could
prevent the Fund from trading in the securities of such companies for limited or
extended periods of time.

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 157,
"Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), on April 1, 2008. SFAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. The Fund has determined that the implementation
of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements.

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market
data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own
market assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining
the value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair
value hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

14. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In March 2008, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
(SFAS 161), which expands disclosures about derivative investments and hedging
activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008. The Fund believes applying the various provisions of
SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on its financial statements.

In April 2009, FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP FAS 157-4, "Determining Fair
Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have
Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly" (FSP
FAS 157-4), which provides additional guidance when the volume and level of
activity for the asset or liability measured at fair value have significantly
decreased. Additionally, FSP FAS 157-4 amends FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements, expanding disclosure requirements by reporting entities
surrounding the major categories of assets and liabilities carried at fair
value. FSP FAS 157-4 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
June 15, 2009. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of applying
FSP FAS 157-4.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
FRANKLIN TEMPLETON LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust (the "Fund") at March 31, 2009, the results of its operations for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at March 31, 2009 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Limited Duration Income Trust

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held February 24, 2009, the Board of Trustees (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust (Fund). In reaching this decision, the Board took into account information
furnished throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information
prepared specifically in connection with the annual renewal review process.
Information furnished and discussed throughout the year included investment
performance reports on the Fund, information on its share price discount to net
asset value, and other related financial information, as well as periodic
reports on legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates.
Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process
included a report prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent
organization, as well as additional material, including a Fund profitability
analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper reports compared the Fund's
investment performance and expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable
to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report
discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall
U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included
with such profitability analysis report was information on a fund-by-fund basis
listing portfolio managers and other accounts they manage, as well as
information on management fees charged by the Manager and its affiliates
including management's explanation of differences where relevant, and a
three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any increase in expense
ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a memorandum prepared
by management describing project initiatives and capital investments relating to
the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin Templeton Investments
organization, as well as a memorandum relating to economies of scale. Such
material also discussed some of the actions taken by management in coping with
problems arising out of the past year's financial upheaval.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished it showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's efforts and
expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures to function
in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted by the Board that such
systems and procedures had functioned smoothly during the Florida hurricanes and
blackouts experienced in recent years. Among other factors taken into account by
the Board were the Manager's best execution trading policies, including a
favorable report by an independent portfolio trading analytical firm.
Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's portfolio
management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of the level of a portfolio manager's bonus
compensation was the relative investment performance of the funds he or she
managed and that a portion of such bonus was required to be invested in a
predesignated list of funds within such person's fund management area so as to
be aligned with the interests of Fund shareholders. Particular attention was
given to the overall performance and actions taken by the Manager and its
affiliates in response to problems arising out of the market turmoil and
financial crisis experienced during the past year. In this respect, the Board
noted that management's independent credit analysis and diligent risk management
procedures had prevented any structured investment products or other volatile
instruments from being held in the portfolios of any of the money market funds
within the Franklin Templeton complex, including the sweep money fund utilized
by the Fund as part of its cash management. The Board also took into account,
among other things, the strong financial position of the Manager's parent
company and its commitment to the fund business. The Board also noted that
during the past year Franklin Templeton Investments, like many other fund
managers, had announced a hiring freeze and implemented employee reductions, and
the Board discussed with management the nature of such reductions and steps
being taken to minimize any negative impact on the nature and quality of
services being provided the Fund.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement renewal.
The Lipper report prepared for the Fund showed its investment performance in
comparison with a performance universe consisting of the Fund and all leveraged
closed-end BBB-rated corporate debt funds as selected by Lipper during 2008 and
the five-year period ended December 31, 2008. Such report considers both income
return and total return on a net asset value basis without regard to market
discounts or premiums to accurately reflect investment performance. The Lipper
report showed the Fund's income return for 2008 to be in the second-highest
quintile of

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

such performance universe and its income return on an annualized basis to also
be in the highest or second-highest quintile of such universe for the previous
three- and five-year periods. The Lipper report showed the Fund's 2008 total
return was the second lowest in such performance universe, and on an annualized
basis was also in the second-lowest quintile of such universe for the previous
three- and five-year periods. The Fund invests in three primary asset classes
consisting of high yield corporate bonds, leveraged bank loans, and mortgage and
other asset-backed securities, and in explaining its total return
underperformance, management pointed out the significant negative returns
generated by high yield bonds and bank loans during the market conditions
existing in 2008. It was also noted with respect to asset-backed securities that
the Fund had limited exposure to securities backed by subprime mortgages, which
amounted to less than 1.5% of assets at December 31, 2008. While intending to
continuously monitor this Fund, the Board believed its total return
underperfor-mance as shown in the Lipper reports primarily reflected its stated
investment strategy.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a Lipper
expense group consisting of the Fund and four other leveraged closed-end
BBB-rated corporate debt funds as selected by Lipper. Lipper expense data is
based upon historical information taken from the Fund's most recent annual
report and, as a result of the severe decline in fund industry assets during the
last quarter of 2008, is based on asset levels that are higher than the level
currently existing for most funds. While recognizing the limitations inherent in
Lipper's methodology and recognizing that current expense ratios may increase as
assets decline, the Board believed that the independent analysis conducted by
Lipper remained an appropriate measure of comparative expenses. In reviewing
comparative costs, Lipper provides information on the Fund's contractual
investment management fee rate in comparison with the contractual investment
management fee that would have been charged by other funds within its Lipper
expense group assuming they were similar in size to the Fund, as well as the
actual total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison with those of its Lipper
expense group. The Lipper contractual investment management fee analysis
includes administrative charges as being part of contractual investment
management fees. The results of such expense comparisons showed that the Fund's
contractual investment management fee rate was the second highest in its Lipper
expense group, but within 10 basis points of its Lipper expense group median,
while its actual total expense ratio, including investment related expenses and
taxes, was at the median of such expense group. The Board found such expenses to
be acceptable.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund during the 12-month period ended September 30, 2008, being the most
recent fiscal

year end for Franklin Resources, Inc., the Manager's parent. During such period,
the assets of the Franklin Templeton U.S. fund business were significantly
higher than currently existing, and to such extent the profitability analysis
does not reflect current Fund operations. While taking this into account in
assessing the significance of the Fund profitability analysis, the Board
recognized such analysis was made at a given point in time and that the decline
in assets and effect on profitability would be reflected in the profitability
analysis covering Franklin Resources' 2009 fiscal year period. In reviewing the
analysis, attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating costs to
the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies are inherently
subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be reasonable while
producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted that, while being
continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's own cost
accounting, such cost allocation methodology was consistent with that followed
in profitability report presentations made in prior years and that the Fund's
independent registered public accounting firm had been engaged by the Manager to
perform certain procedures on a biennial basis, specified and approved by the
Manager and the Fund's Board solely for their purposes and use in reference to
the profitability analysis. In reviewing and discussing such analysis,
management discussed with the Board its belief that costs incurred in
establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of mutual fund operations
conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully reflected in the
expenses allocated to each Fund in determining its profitability, as well as the
fact that the level of profits, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost
savings and efficiencies initiated by management. In addition, the Board
considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the Manager's
parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers broken
down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution
expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses. The Board
also considered the extent to which the Manager and its affiliates might derive
ancillary benefits from fund operations, as well as potential benefits resulting
from allocation of fund brokerage and the use of commission dollars to pay for
research. Based upon its consideration of all these factors, the Board
determined that the level of profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates
from providing services to the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature,
quality and extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders and intends to monitor
future growth of the Fund accordingly.

(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of regulation S-X.

(f) No disclosures are required by this Item 4(f).

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees paid to the principal accountant for services
rendered by the principal accountant to the registrant and the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant were $300,677 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and $11,903
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.

(h) The registrant's audit committee of the board has considered whether the
provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence

Members of the Audit Committee are: Robert F. Carlson,  Frank W.T. LaHaye, Frank
A. Olson and John B. Wilson.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of
another independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy
directly to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If
the conflict is not resolved by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter,
along with the recommended course of action by the manager to an
interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include portfolio managers
and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting
instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation
of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third party provider
of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group
or the Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of trustees or a
committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on Sections 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or pursuant to
an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests uninvested cash in affiliated
money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive order ("cash sweep
arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's governing documents
or applicable law. Echo voting means that the Investment Manager will vote the
shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the
fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

proxy voting records are available online at franklintempleton.com and posted on
the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV. The proxy voting records are updated each year
by August 31 to reflect the most recent 12-month period ended June 30.

</TABLE>


1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual manager listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures help to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. The separate management of the trade execution and
valuation functions from the portfolio management process also helps to reduce
potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected for funds or
accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected for the
Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and mutual fund shares (17.5% to 25%).
         The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to build a vested
         interest of the portfolio manager in the financial performance of both
         Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The bonus plan is
         intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation
         that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving consistently strong
         investment performance, which aligns the financial incentives of the
         portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief Investment Officer
         of the manager and/or other officers of the manager, with
         responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of annual
         bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin Templeton
         guidelines. The following factors are generally used in determining
         bonuses under the plan:

o    INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.  Primary  consideration  is given to the  historic
     investment  performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding years of all accounts
     managed by the  portfolio  manager.  The pre-tax  performance  of each fund
     managed is measured  relative to a relevant  peer group  and/or  applicable
     benchmark as appropriate.

o    NON-INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.   The  more  qualitative  contributions  of  a
     portfolio manager to the manager's  business and the investment  management
     team, including  professional  knowledge,  productivity,  responsiveness to
     client needs and communication,  are evaluated in determining the amount of
     any bonus award.

o    RESPONSIBILITIES.  The  characteristics  and complexity of funds managed by
     the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of Resources stock or
         restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds, and options to
         purchase common shares of Resources stock. Awards of such deferred
         equity-based compensation typically vest over time, so as to create
         incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):

disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the

PROCEDURES   Revised December 22, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

     This  Code  shall be the sole  code of  ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

     Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  has  separately  adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS  CONDUCT  ("Business  Conduct"),  which is  applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It  summarizes  the values,  principles  and business  practices  that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers,  directors and employees  regarding the minimum  ethical  requirements
expected of them. It supplements  the values,  principles  and business  conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

     Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the CODE
OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal  securities
trading and other related  matters.  The Code for Insider  Trading  provides for
separate  requirements  that  apply to the  Covered  Officers  and  others,  and
therefore is not part of this Code.

     Insofar as other  policies or procedures of Franklin  Resources,  Inc., the
Funds, the Funds' adviser,  principal  underwriter,  or other service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are  subject to this Code,  they are  superceded  by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the  provisions  of this Code.  Please review
these other  documents or consult with the Legal  Department  if have  questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service to, the FT
Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,  or
a member of his  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the FT Funds and  already  are  subject  to  conflict  of
interest  provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds.  The FT Funds'
and the investment  advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the FT Funds,  the  investment  advisers and the fund  administrator  of
which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this
Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser,  the  administrator,
or for all  three),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and  implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The  participation  of the  Covered  Officers in such  activities  is
inherent in the contractual  relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds.  Thus,  if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized  by the FT Funds'  Boards  of  Directors  ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
