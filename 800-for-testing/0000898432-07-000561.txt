CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report for Neuberger Berman Real
Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. for the six months ended April 30, 2007. The
report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments, and
its financial statements for the reporting period.

As previously communicated, in April 2007, the Board of Directors approved an
increase in the Fund's distribution rates. The Board made its decision after
careful evaluation of the Fund's financial condition, the rates of distributions
being paid by the Fund's peers, the potential positive impact a higher
distribution could have on the Fund's market price relative to its net asset
value, and the potential for the Fund to obtain exemptive relief to implement a
managed distribution plan (as described below) within a reasonable time.

As part of its ongoing evaluation of options available to reduce the discount at
which the Fund's common stock trades, the Board has considered a managed
distribution plan, under which the Fund could include long-term capital gains in
its distributions to stockholders more frequently than is permitted by the
Investment Company Act of 1940. In 2004, the Fund filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) an exemptive application to allow such distributions;
shortly thereafter, however, the SEC, for policy reasons, imposed a moratorium
on such exemptions. The SEC recently indicated its willingness to consider such
applications again, subject to new conditions. After careful evaluation and
discussion of the new conditions over the course of several meetings, the Board
determined that a managed distribution plan continues to be an attractive option
for the Fund and approved the filing of an amended application with the new
conditions.

Although there is no guarantee that the increase in distributions will have a
sustained positive impact on the discount at which the Fund's common stock
trades or that the Fund will receive the exemptive relief it seeks to implement
a managed distribution plan, we are pleased that the initial reaction of the
market has been favorable. The Board will continue to monitor the impact that
these steps have on the Fund and its shareholders.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY

In the six months ended April 30, 2007, on a net asset value (NAV) basis,
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. posted a respectable
return but trailed the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index benchmark. The Fund's
performance shortfall was due primarily to an underweight in the strong Shopping
Center and Regional Mall sectors, lagging performance in the Office sector, and
positions in REIT preferred securities.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) performed quite well through the first
half of the reporting period but declined sharply along with the broad stock
market in mid-February. REITs rebounded following this sell-off, but failed to
keep pace with the S&P 500 Index, which was bolstered by strength in large
multi-national companies benefiting from the falling U.S. dollar. Weakness in
the Apartments sector caused by the large influx of unsold condominiums and
homes coming into the rental market also restrained REIT returns. Absent a
significant decline in the Apartments sector (about 17% of our benchmark index
and the only sector with negative returns), REIT performance would have been
considerably more impressive.

Premium valuations and low yields caused us to underweight retail REITs
(Shopping Centers and Regional Malls). Unfortunately, this positioning proved
counterproductive during the reporting period as these sectors collectively
delivered well-above benchmark returns. Declines in Maguire Properties, a
southern California-based office REIT, that had the misfortune of having several
sub-prime lenders, including the now bankrupt New Century Financial, as major
tenants, and American Financial Realty, a Pennsylvania-based company
specializing in leasing properties to financial institutions, dragged down
returns in the Office sector. Although the Fund was substantially underweight in
the Apartments sector and our investments outperformed the corresponding
Apartments sector of the benchmark, a net decline penalized absolute returns.

The Fund's overweight and solid performance in the Health Care sector enhanced
absolute and relative returns. The strong performance of Commercial Financing
Mortgage REITs sector investments (a sector not included in the Fund's benchmark
index), also buoyed performance.

With the exception of the Apartments sector, commercial real estate fundamentals
remain healthy. Increased demand coupled with restrained supply growth due to
higher development costs has translated into better occupancy rates, rising rent
levels, and above-historical-average REIT earnings growth, (which we expect to
be in the 8%-9% range in full-year 2007), in most property sectors.

Rather anemic first quarter Gross Domestic Product growth has prompted some
concern that REIT fundamentals may weaken along with the economy in the year
ahead. We believe that as long as employment remains strong, REIT fundamentals
will remain sound. In addition, we expect the economy to re-accelerate in the
second half of calendar 2007 as the weak dollar boosts exports to faster growing
international markets, business spending increases to rebuild depleted
inventories, and a more stable housing market is less of a drag on the economy.

While REITs have become more fully valued relative to historical average
price/earnings ratios and yield, they remain undervalued relative to NAV, in our
opinion, which, in view of recent transaction prices, may be understated. Over
the last 12 months alone, 16 publicly traded REITs have been taken over (in
dollar volume, in excess of $50 billion). On average, deals are being done at a
10% to 15% premium to published NAV. During this six-month reporting period, two
of our holdings (New Plan Excel and Spirit Finance) were acquired by Australian
financial institutions. We


                                       2

expect institutional money to continue to flow into alternative investment pools
including real estate opportunity funds. Consequently, we maintain a strong bias
toward REITs trading at discounts to NAV and expect further consolidation in the
REIT market to continue to surface value in the portfolio.

In closing, while we have cautioned shareholders not to expect recent years'
outsized returns in the REIT market to continue indefinitely, we believe the
combination of sound fundamentals, strong earnings growth, a high level of
liquidity in the financial system, and ongoing merger and acquisition activity
will continue to support attractive REIT returns in the year ahead.

Sincerely,


/s/ Steven R. Brown

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered. There is
an initial public offering and, once issued, common shares of closed-end funds
are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

The composition, industries and holdings of the Fund are subject to change.
Investment return will fluctuate. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in equity securities by Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities
     Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") are valued at the latest sale price where
     that price is readily available; securities for which no sales were
     reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at the last available bid
     price. Securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market are normally
     valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided
     by NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most recently reported price
     as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price is outside the range of
     the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid and asked prices that
     dealers quote to each other when trading for their own accounts); in that
     case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the inside bid or asked price,
     whichever is closer. Because of delays in reporting trades, the NOCP may
     not be based on the price of the last trade to occur before the market
     closes. The Fund values all other securities, including securities for
     which the necessary last sale, asked and/or bid prices are not readily
     available, by methods the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") has
     approved on the belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may
     be considered when determining the fair value of a security, including
     available analyst, media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and
     whether the issuer of the security being fair valued has other securities
     outstanding. Foreign security prices are furnished by independent quotation
     services and expressed in local currency values. Foreign security prices
     are currently translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars using
     the exchange rate as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. The Board has approved the
     use of FT Interactive Data Corporation ("FT Interactive") to assist in
     determining the fair value of the Fund's foreign equity securities when
     changes in the value of a certain index suggest that the closing prices on
     the foreign exchanges may no longer represent the amount that the Fund
     could expect to receive for those securities. In this event, FT Interactive
     will provide adjusted prices for certain foreign equity securities using a
     statistical analysis of historical correlations of multiple factors. In the
     absence of precise information about the market values of these foreign
     securities as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board has
     determined on the basis of available data that prices adjusted in this way
     are likely to be closer to the prices the Fund could realize on a current
     sale than are the prices of those securities established at the close of
     the foreign markets in which the securities primarily trade. However, fair
     value prices are necessarily estimates, and there is no assurance that such
     a price will be at or close to the price at which the security next trades.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.

#    At cost, which approximates market value.

##   At April 30, 2007, the cost of investments for U.S. federal income tax
     purposes was $817,311,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of investments was
     $194,568,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of investments was
     $4,867,000, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $189,701,000, based
     on cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

~    Managed by an affiliate of Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and could be
     deemed an affiliate of the Fund (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements).

@    Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime Money") is also managed by
     Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and may be considered an affiliate since
     it has the same officers, Board members, and investment manager as the Fund
     and because, at times, the Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding
     voting securities of Prime Money (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements).

(2)  All or a portion of this security is on loan (see Note A of Notes to
     Financial Statements).

*    Security did not produce income during the last twelve months.

(1)  Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A
     and have been deemed by the investment manager to be liquid. At April 30,
     2007, these securities amounted to $1,274,000 or 0.2% of net assets
     applicable to common shareholders.

(5)  All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for interest
     rate swap contracts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
     "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as a
     non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Board of
     Directors of the Fund (the "Board") may classify or re-classify any
     unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred
     stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on trade date for financial reporting purposes. Dividend income is
     recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend
     income, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities
     received. Interest income, including accretion of original issue discount,
     where applicable, and accretion of discount on short-term investments, if
     any, is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from
     securities transactions and foreign currency transactions, if any, are
     recorded on the basis of identified cost and stated separately in the
     Statement of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to qualify
     as a regulated investment company by complying with the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
     investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its earnings to
     its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is
     required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by the Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by the Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2006, permanent differences resulting
     primarily from different book and tax accounting for distributions in
     excess of earnings and income recognized on interest rate swaps were
     reclassified at fiscal year-end. These reclassifications had no effect on
     net income, net asset value applicable to common shareholders or net asset
     value per common share of the Fund.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
     2006 and October 31, 2005 was as follows:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. cont'd.

As of October 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a U.S. federal income tax basis were as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
UNDISTRIBUTED   UNDISTRIBUTED     UNREALIZED         LOSS
  ORDINARY        LONG-TERM      APPRECIATION    CARRYFORWARDS

     $--         $16,374,700     $229,040,155          $--       $245,414,855
</Table>

     The difference between book and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments and
     income recognized on interest rate swaps.

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of the Fund to declare quarterly
     and pay monthly distributions to common shareholders. The Fund has adopted
     a policy to pay common shareholders a stable monthly distribution. The
     Fund's ability to satisfy its policy will depend on a number of factors,
     including the stability of income received from its investments, the
     availability of capital gains, distributions paid on preferred shares and
     the level of expenses. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution
     amount, the Fund may pay distributions consisting of net investment income,
     realized gains and paid-in capital. There is no assurance that the Fund
     will always be able to pay distributions of a particular size, or that
     distributions will consist solely of net investment income and realized
     capital gains. The composition of the Fund's distributions for the calendar
     year 2007 will be reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099DIV. The
     Fund may pay distributions in excess of those required by its stable
     distribution policy to avoid excise tax or to satisfy the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Distributions to common
     shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Net realized capital gains, if
     any, will be offset to the extent of any available capital loss
     carryforwards. Any such offset will not reduce the level of the stable
     distribution paid by the Fund. Distributions to preferred shareholders are
     accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities issued
     by real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts
     ("REITs"). The distributions the Fund receives from REITs are generally
     comprised of income, capital gains, and return of capital, but the REITs do
     not report this information to the Fund until the following calendar year.
     At October 31, 2006, the Fund estimated these amounts within the financial
     statements since the information is not available from the REITs until
     after the Fund's fiscal year-end. At April 30, 2007, the Fund estimated
     these amounts for the period January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 within the
     financial statements since the 2007 information is not available from the
     REITs until after the Fund's fiscal period. For the year ended October 31,
     2006, the character of distributions paid to shareholders is disclosed
     within the Statement of Changes and is also based on these estimates. All
     estimates are based upon REIT information sources available to the Fund
     together with actual IRS Forms 1099DIV received to date. Based on past
     experience it is probable that a portion of the Fund's distributions during
     the current fiscal year will be considered tax return of capital but the
     actual amount of tax return of capital, if any, is not determinable until
     after the Fund's fiscal year end. After calendar year-end, when the Fund
     learns the nature of the distributions paid by REITs during that year,
     distributions previously identified as income are often recharacterized as
     return of capital and/or capital gain. After all applicable REITs have
     informed the Fund of the actual breakdown of distributions paid to


                                       14

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

     the Fund during its fiscal year, estimates previously recorded are adjusted
     on the books of the Fund to reflect actual results. As a result, the
     composition of the Fund's distributions as reported herein may differ from
     the final composition determined after calendar year-end and reported to
     Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099DIV.

     The Fund declared two monthly distributions to common shareholders in the
     amount of $0.15308 per share per month, payable after the close of the
     reporting period, on May 31, 2007 and June 29, 2007, to shareholders of
     record on May 15, 2007 and June 15, 2007, respectively, with ex-dates of
     May 11, 2007 and June 13, 2007, respectively.

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund.
     Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
     includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management
     serves as investment manager, that are not directly attributed to the Fund
     are allocated among the Fund and the other investment companies in the
     complex or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where
     a more appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund re-classified
     12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A Auction Market
     Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series C
     Auction Market Preferred Shares and Series D Auction Market Preferred
     Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27, 2004, the Fund issued 2,450 Series A AMPS,
     2,450 Series B AMPS, 2,450 Series C AMPS and 2,450 Series D AMPS. All AMPS
     have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
     unpaid distributions, whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but
     excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").

     Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period, distributions to
     preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily and paid
     every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C
     and Series D AMPS. Distribution rates are reset every 7 days for Series A
     and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS based on
     the results of an auction, except during special rate periods. For the six
     months ended April 30, 2007, distribution rates ranged from 4.90% to 5.30%
     for Series A, 4.95% to 5.30% for Series B, 5.24% to 5.28% for Series C and
     5.15% to 5.25% for Series D AMPS. The Fund declared distributions to
     preferred shareholders for the period May 1, 2007 to May 31, 2007 of
     ($267,908, $269,315, $273,034 and $271,648) for Series A, Series B, Series
     C and Series D AMPS, respectively.

     The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second business day
     preceding any distribution payment date at Liquidation Value. The Fund is
     also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS. Failure to
     comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
     distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or
     could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value. The
     holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common shares as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on


                                       15

     certain matters, as required by law or the Fund's charter. The holders of
     the AMPS, voting as a separate class, are entitled at all times to elect
     two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a majority of the Directors of the
     Fund if the Fund fails to pay distributions on AMPS for two consecutive
     years.

8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
     transactions, with institutions that Management has determined are
     creditworthy, to reduce the risk that an increase in short-term interest
     rates could reduce common share net earnings as a result of leverage. Under
     the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Fund agrees to pay the
     swap counter party a fixed-rate payment in exchange for the counter party's
     paying the Fund a variable-rate payment that is intended to approximate all
     or a portion of the Fund's variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's
     AMPS. The fixed-rate and variable-rate payment flows are netted against
     each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other on a
     monthly basis. The Fund segregates cash or liquid securities having a value
     at least equal to the Fund's net payment obligations under any swap
     transaction, marked to market daily.

     Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to comply
     with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the failure of a
     counter party is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
     received by the Fund and/or the termination value at the end of the
     contract. Additionally, risks may arise from movements in interest rates
     unanticipated by Management.

     Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on the swaps
     are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized gains/losses, along with the
     fair value of the future periodic payment streams on the swaps. The
     unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic interim net interest
     payments are reclassified to realized gains/losses in conjunction with the
     actual net receipt or payment of such amounts. The reclassifications do not
     impact the Fund's total net assets applicable to common shareholders or its
     total net increase (decrease) in net assets applicable to common
     shareholders resulting from operations. At April 30, 2007, the Fund had
     outstanding interest rate swap contracts as follows:

9    SECURITY LENDING: Since 2005, a third party, eSecLending has assisted the
     Fund in conducting a bidding process to identify agents/principals that
     would pay a guaranteed amount to the Fund in consideration of the Fund
     entering into an exclusive securities lending arrangement.

     Through a bidding process in August 2006, and in accordance with an
     Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund
     selected Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), an affiliate of the Fund, to
     be its exclusive lending agent for a specified period. Under the agreement
     entered into between the Fund and Neuberger, Neuberger pays a guaranteed
     amount to the Fund.

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

     Under the securities lending arrangements, the Fund receives cash
     collateral at the beginning of each transaction equal to at least 102% of
     the prior day's market value of the loaned securities (105% in the case of
     international securities). The Fund may invest all the cash collateral in
     Neuberger Berman Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Quality Fund"), a
     fund managed by Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC, an affiliate of
     Management.

     Net income from the applicable lending program represents the guaranteed
     amount plus income earned on the cash collateral invested in Quality Fund
     or in other investments, less cash collateral fees and other expenses
     associated with the loans. For the six months ended April 30, 2007, the
     Fund received net income under the securities lending arrangements of
     approximately $56,310, which is reflected in the Statement of Operations
     under the caption "Income from securities loaned-net." For the six months
     ended April 30, 2007, "Income from securities loaned-net" consisted of
     approximately $1,348,210 in income earned on cash collateral and guaranteed
     amounts (including approximately $1,288,750 of interest income earned from
     the Quality Fund and $59,460 in guaranteed amounts received from
     Neuberger), less fees and expenses paid of approximately $1,291,900
     (including approximately $7,511 retained by Neuberger).

10   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
     institutions that Management has determined are creditworthy. Each
     repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The Fund requires that the
     securities purchased in a repurchase agreement be transferred to the
     custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the Fund to assert a perfected
     security interest in those securities in the event of a default under the
     repurchase agreement. The Fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the
     securities transferred to ensure that their value, including accrued
     interest, is greater than amounts owed to the Fund under each such
     repurchase agreement.

11   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN MANAGEMENT INC.:
     Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission, the Fund may invest in a money market fund managed by
     Management or an affiliate. The Fund invests in Neuberger Berman Prime
     Money Fund ("Prime Money"), as approved by the Board. Prime Money seeks to
     provide the highest available current income consistent with safety and
     liquidity. For any cash that the Fund invests in Prime Money, Management
     waives a portion of its management fee equal to the management fee it
     receives from Prime Money on those assets (the "Arrangement"). For the six
     months ended April 30, 2007, management fees waived under this Arrangement
     amounted to $2,532 and are reflected in the Statement of Operations under
     the caption "Investment management fees waived." For the six months ended
     April 30, 2007, income earned under this Arrangement amounted to $161,626
     and is reflected in the Statement of Operations under the caption "Income
     from investments in affiliated issuers."

12   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
     investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
     securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and
     non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving the majority
     of their revenue from the ownership, construction, financing, management
     and/or sale of commercial, industrial, and/or residential real estate. The
     value of the Fund's shares may fluctuate more due to economic, legal,
     cultural, geopolitical or technological

     developments affecting the United States real estate industry, or a segment
     of the United States real estate industry in which the Fund owns a
     substantial position, than would the shares of a fund not concentrated in
     the real estate industry.

13   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Fund's organizational
     documents provide that its officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Fund. In addition, both in some of its principal service contracts and in
     the normal course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against the Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, the Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the following annual rates:

                                            YEAR ENDED       % OF AVERAGE
                                           OCTOBER 31,   DAILY MANAGED ASSETS
                                           ----------------------------------
                                           2007 - 2008           0.25
                                               2009              0.19
                                               2010              0.13
                                               2011              0.07


     Management has not contractually agreed to waive any portion of its fees
     beyond October 31, 2011.

     For the six months ended April 30, 2007, such waived fees amounted to
     $1,174,640.

     The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. The Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and
     sub-adviser to the Fund, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers
     Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly-owned holding company. Neuberger is
     retained by Management to furnish it with investment recommendations and
     research information without added cost to the Fund. Several individuals
     who are officers and/or Directors of the Fund are also employees of
     Neuberger and/or Management.

     The Fund has entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it
     to pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the
     commissions it pays to a broker that is not a related party of the Fund.
     Pursuant to the agreement, brokers pay recaptured commissions to the Fund's
     custodian and the custodian directs these amounts toward payment of
     expenses such as custodial, transfer agency or accounting services. For the
     six months ended April 30, 2007, the impact of this arrangement was a
     reduction of expenses of $20,804.

     The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its custodian
     contract. For the six months ended April 30, 2007, the impact of this
     arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $3,291.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, the Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that the
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. The Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report, which is reflected in the
     Statement of Operations under the caption "Basic maintenance expense."

     NOTE C--SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS:

     During the six months ended April 30, 2007, there were purchase and sale
     transactions (excluding short-term securities and interest rate swap
     contracts) of $79,240,776 and $101,653,516, respectively.

     During the six months ended April 30, 2007, brokerage commissions on
     securities transactions amounted to $384,261, of which Neuberger received
     $0, Lehman Brothers Inc. received $59,950, and other brokers received
     $324,311.

     NOTE D--CAPITAL:

     At April 30, 2007, the common shares outstanding and the common shares of
     the Fund owned by Neuberger were as follows:

     NOTE F--RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

     On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
     released FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
     Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions
     should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
     statements. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by
     prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to
     meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
     that a "more-likely-than-not" threshold be met before the benefit of a tax
     position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how
     such benefit should be measured. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal
     years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
     tax years as of the effective date. The Securities and Exchange Commission
     has permitted investment companies to delay implementation of FIN 48. The
     Fund will have until April 30, 2008 to implement FIN 48. At this time,
     Management is evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and its impact in the
     financial statements has not yet been determined.

     In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value
     Measurement" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a
     framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair
     value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
     November 15, 2007, and

     interim periods within those fiscal years. Management believes the adoption
     of SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on the Fund's financial
     positions or results of operations.

     NOTE G--UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

     The financial information included in this interim report is taken from the
     records of the Fund without audit by an independent registered public
     accounting firm. Annual reports contain audited financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under the Fund's distribution reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may
     be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment returns may
     fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than original
     cost. Total return would have been lower if Management had not waived a
     portion of the investment management fee.

#    The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

~    After waiver of a portion of the investment management fee by Management.
     Had Management not undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net
     expenses to average daily net assets applicable to common shareholders
     would have been:

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the
Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current
Shares are registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as
of the first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the payment date, to apply the
amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares (less their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend or distribution except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day
during the purchase period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than
the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent
will not make any further open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of such dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases
during the purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to
the uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue
new Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the
purchase period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net
asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus
estimated brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the
terms specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the reinvestment purchase comparison under the Plan, (a)
the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last sales
price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are principally
traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or if not so
listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean between the
closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on such date
and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be the net
asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund. All
dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or Shares)
shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
Participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.
