2003 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On June 24, 2003, the Fund held an annual meeting to:

1.   Elect three trustees.

2.   Consider whether to convert the Fund from a closed-end investment company into an open-end investment company. The Fund's
     Declaration of Trust required a shareholder vote on this question because the Fund's shares had traded at an average discount
     of more than 10% to its net asset value over a 12-week-period beginning after the most recent such vote.

3.   Consider whether to adopt a shareholder proposal by Laxey Partners Limited, owner together with its affiliates of 3,973,600, or
     approximately 12.2%, of the Fund's outstanding shares as of the record date of the meeting, to terminate the Fund's investment
     advisory contract with International Investment Trust Company Limited (IIT).

The results of the stockholder votes are shown below. Proxies representing 24,651,201, or 75.39%, of the 32,698,976 eligible shares
outstanding were voted in respect of the election of trustees. The trustees of the Fund recommended that stockholders vote against
the conversion proposal, which would have required the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares to pass. Proxies
representing approximately 23.4% of the outstanding shares were voted for conversion. The trustees also recommended that
stockholders vote against the termination proposal, the passage of which would have required (in accordance with the Investment
Company Act of 1940) the affirmative vote of the lesser of (1) a majority of all outstanding shares of the Fund or (2) 67% of the
shares present or represented by proxy so long as a majority of the outstanding shares were present or represented at the meeting.
Proxies representing approximately 21.7% of the outstanding shares were voted in favor of termination.

The Trustees and Shareholders of
The R.O.C. Taiwan Fund

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of The R.O.C. Taiwan Fund, a Massachusetts
business trust (the "Trust"), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of June 30, 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the consolidated financial highlights for the six-month period ended June
30, 2003. These consolidated financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibilities of the Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review
of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to financial data and making inquiries of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements and
financial highlights referred to above in order for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the
consolidated statement of changes in net assets for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the consolidated financial highlights for
each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2002, and in our report dated January 10, 2003, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights.
