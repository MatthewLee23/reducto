Sidebar text: WE THINK YOUR NUVEEN FUND CAN BE AN IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK IN A
PORTFOLIO DESIGNED TO PERFORM WELL THROUGH A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS.

Dear
  SHAREHOLDER

I am very pleased to report that for the year ended October 31, 2003, your
Nuveen Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly tax-free income.

Your Nuveen Fund is managed with a value investing strategy that puts an
emphasis on finding securities that we think are undervalued or underrated. We
believe that there are always some municipal bonds that the market is not
properly valuing, and that by using a consistent, research-oriented management
approach we have the opportunity to find them for your Fund.

In this low-rate environment, many have begun to wonder whether
interest rates will soon start to rise, and whether that possibility should
cause them to adjust their holdings of fixed-income investments. We believe that
by constructing a carefully balanced portfolio with the help of a trusted
investment professional you may be able to reduce your overall investment risk
and give yourself a better chance to meet your financial goals. We think that
municipal bond investments like your Nuveen Fund can be important building
blocks in a portfolio designed to perform well through a variety of market
conditions.

Since 1898, Nuveen Investments has offered financial products and solutions that
incorporate careful research, diversification, and the application of
conservative risk-management principles. We are grateful that you have chosen us
as a partner as you pursue your financial goals. We look forward to continuing
to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Timothy R. Schwertfeger
Chairman of the Board

Nuveen National Insured Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds (NQI, NIO,
NIF, NPX, NVG, NEA)

Portfolio Manager's
               COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Tom O'Shaughnessy discusses U.S. economic and market
conditions, key investment strategies, and the annual performance of the
national insured Funds. With 20 years of investment experience at Nuveen, Tom
assumed portfolio management responsibility for NEA at its inception in November
2002, adding NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, and NVG in January 2003.

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE 12-MONTH
PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2003?

Over the 12-month reporting period, the two greatest influences on the general
economy continued to be historically low interest rates and the overall pace of
economic improvement. In June 2003, the Federal Reserve reduced the fed funds
rate to 1.0%, the lowest level since 1958. The Fed's accommodative monetary
policy coupled with Washington's tax relief measures and increased spending for
defense helped to fuel an 8.2% jump year-over-year in the third-quarter Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), up from 3.3% in the second quarter. At the same time,
inflation remained under control throughout the period.

In the municipal market, the slower rate of economic recovery over the majority
of this reporting period, low interest rates, and lack of inflationary pressures
helped many municipal bonds perform well. During the summer of 2003, however,
stronger-than-expected economic data precipitated a spike in bond yields and a
corresponding drop in bond prices that impacted results across all fixed-income
markets, including the municipal market, for the 12-month period ended October
31, 2003.

During the first 10 months of 2003, municipal supply nationally remained robust,
with $319.9 billion in new bonds, up 8% over the same period in 2002.

HOW DID THESE NUVEEN FUNDS PERFORM OVER THIS REPORTING PERIOD?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as for relevant benchmarks, are
presented in the accompanying table.

For additional information, see the individual Performance Overview for your
Fund in this report.

1 The total annual returns on common share net asset value (NAV) for these
  Nuveen Funds are compared with the total annual return of the Lehman Brothers
  Insured Municipal Bond Index, an unleveraged, unmanaged index comprising a
  broad range of insured municipal bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not
  reflect any expenses.

2 The total returns of these Funds are compared with the average annualized
  return of the 24 funds in the Lipper Insured Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds
  category. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of dividends.

3 The taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
  taxable investment, other than an investment that generates qualified dividend
  income that is taxable at a maximum rate of 15%, in order to equal the yield
  of the Nuveen Fund on an after-tax basis. It is calculated using the current
  market yield and a federal income tax rate of 28%.

<PAGE>

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2003, all of the Funds in this report with
at least one year of performance history outperformed the unleveraged Lehman
Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index. NIO, NIF, and NVG also outperformed their
Lipper peer group average, while NPX performed in line with the Lipper average
while NQI trailed this measure. The use of leverage was one of the factors that
influenced the performances of these Funds relative to the Lehman index over the
past 12 months. While this is a strategy that carries some price risk and
increased volatility, leveraging can provide opportunities for additional income
for common shareholders, especially during periods of low short-term interest
rates.

In general, the Funds also benefited from their duration4 positioning during
this period. As of October 31, 2003, the durations of the four older Funds
ranged (NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX) from 7.59 to 9.94, while NVG and NEA had
durations of 10.02 and 11.47, respectively, compared with 8.98 for the Lehman
insured index. However, NPX's duration of 7.59 kept the Fund from fully
benefiting from the decline in interest rates during much of the past year.

In addition to leverage and duration, factors such as call exposure, portfolio
trading activity, and the price movement of specific sectors and holdings also
had an impact on the Funds' relative performances during this period. For
example, as of October 31, 2003 NQI and NPX held 7% and 8%, respectively, of
their portfolios in multifamily housing bonds. For the 12 months ended October
2003, the multifamily housing sector, as measured by the Lehman index, was among
the poorer performers, lagging the insured municipal market by almost 80 basis
points.

HOW DID THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates remaining at historically low levels, the
dividend-paying capabilities of these Funds benefited from their use of
leverage. During the 12 months ended October 31, 2003, continued low short-term
rates enabled us to implement two dividend increases in NQI and NPX and one each
in NIO and NIF. Leverage also helped to support the dividends of the two newer
Funds, as NVG and NEA continued to pay shareholders steady, attractive dividends
since their first dividend declarations in May 2002 and January 2003,
respectively.

4 Duration is a measure of a fund's NAV volatility in reaction to interest rate
  movements. Fund duration, also known as leverage-adjusted duration, takes into
  account the leveraging process for a fund and therefore is generally longer
  than the duration of the actual portfolio of individual bonds that make up the
  fund. References to duration in this commentary are intended to indicate fund
  duration unless otherwise noted.

                                       3

<PAGE>

Even at these dividend levels, each Fund's common share net investment income
during the period exceeded the amount of dividends paid to common shareholders.
This excess net investment income, along with any excess net investment income
from prior fiscal periods, was held in reserve by the Funds as undistributed net
investment income (UNII) and is part of the Funds' net asset value. The Funds,
over time, will pay all their net investment income out to common shareholders.
However, UNII reserves may help the Funds maintain more stable common share
dividend levels over time should the short-term rates the Funds pay on their
MuniPreferred shares rise or net common share earnings otherwise decline.

Despite the increased volatility in the fixed-income markets during the summer
of 2003, the share prices of all four of the older Funds (NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX)
ended the period higher than they had been at the beginning. As of October 31,
2003, NQI had moved to trading at a premium to its common share NAV from a
discount 12 months earlier, and the discounts on NIO, NIF, and NPX had narrowed.
NVG and NEA both saw slight declines in share price during this period; NEA
continued to trade at a premium, while the discount on NVG widened modestly .

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED
OCTOBER 31, 2003?

Over this 12-month reporting period, we continued to place strong emphasis on
keeping the Funds fully invested and well diversified, improving call
protection, and enhancing dividend-paying capabilities. We also continued to
focus on managing the Funds' durations as a way of enhancing our ability to
mitigate interest rate risk and produce potentially more consistent returns over
time. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a Fund's portfolio will
decline when market interest rates rise. The longer the duration of a Fund's
portfolio, the greater its interest rate risk. Over the past 12 months, we
worked to make the Funds' durations more consistent with one another, although
the duration of the newest Fund--NEA--was kept somewhat longer to provide
additional support for its income stream in the current market environment.

                                       4

<PAGE>

In line with the steepness of the municipal yield curve, the majority of our
purchase activity over the past year focused on value opportunities in the
intermediate part of the yield curve (i.e., bonds that mature in 15 to 20
years). In many cases, bonds in this part of the curve offered yields similar to
those of longer-term bonds but, in our opinion, had less inherent interest rate
risk.

We also took advantage of strategies that would enable us to reduce taxable
distributions to shareholders. Over the past four months, as appropriate
opportunities arose, we took losses on selected bonds in order to offset the
substantial capital gains that had accumulated in some of the Funds. We also
began to gradually cut our holdings of AMT (alternative minimum tax) bonds. In
November 2002, we also introduced NEA, which cannot invest in any AMT bonds.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
OCTOBER 31, 2003?

We believe that, given the current geopolitical and economic climate,
maintaining strong credit quality remains a vital requirement. The four older
Funds continued to be 100% invested in insured and/or U.S. guaranteed bonds,
while the two newer Funds (NVG and NEA), which are allowed to invest up to 20%
in uninsured investment-grade quality securities, held 88% and 89% of their
portfolios, respectively, in insured and/or U.S. guaranteed bonds as of October
31, 2003.

Looking at bond calls, NVG and NEA should not face any significant call exposure
for several years, while the four older Funds offer good levels of protection
over the next two years, with potential call exposure ranging from 8% in NIF to
21% in NQI during 2004 and 2005. The number of bond calls will depend largely on
market interest rates in coming months.

In general, we believe that these Nuveen Funds can continue to serve as
attractive sources of tax-free income, while simultaneously offering the
potential for considerable portfolio diversification. In our opinion, the Funds
represent a quality component of a well-balanced core investment portfolio that
can continue to benefit shareholders over time.

NUVEEN PREMIER INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND, INC.
NUVEEN INSURED PREMIUM INCOME MUNICIPAL FUND 2
NUVEEN INSURED DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2,
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free
Advantage Municipal Fund as of October 31, 2003, and the related statements of
operations, changes in net assets and the financial highlights for the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of investments owned as of October 31, 2003, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where
replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Municipal
Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2, Nuveen Insured Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund at
October 31, 2003, and the results of their operations, changes in their net
assets and financial highlights for the periods indicated therein in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The National Funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding
Common share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund,
Inc. (NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen
Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Common shares of
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
diversified management investment companies.

Prior to the commencement of operations of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA), each Fund had no operations other than those
related to organizational matters, the initial capital contribution of $100,275
per Fund by Nuveen Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Nuveen Investments, Inc. (formerly, The John Nuveen Company), and the recording
of the organization expenses ($11,500 per Fund) and their reimbursement by
Nuveen Investments, LLC (formerly, Nuveen Investments), also a wholly owned
subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Securities Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers, evaluation of
anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. If it is
determined that market prices for a security are unavailable or inappropriate,
the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish a
fair value for the security. Temporary investments in securities that have
variable rate and demand features qualifying them as short-term securities are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2003,
Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) had outstanding when-issued purchase
commitments of $2,085,070. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments
in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its net investment
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Furthermore, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable
interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed
to shareholders of the Funds. All monthly tax-exempt income dividends paid
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003, have been designated Exempt
Interest Dividends

<PAGE>

                Notes to
                    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)



Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.
Each Fund's Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate on each Series may change every seven days, as set pursuant to a dutch
auction process by the auction agent, and is payable at or near the end of each
rate period. The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total,
for each Fund is as follows:

</TABLE>

Effective January 17, 2003, Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) issued 2,880 Series
T and 2,880 Series W, $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.

Insurance

Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets (including net assets applicable to Preferred
shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance. Each Fund may
also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets applicable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
securities, or (ii) municipal bonds that are rated, at the time of investment,
within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch)
or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.


                                       62

<PAGE>

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance is effective only while the municipal securities are held by the
Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the market value of
the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net asset value of the
Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio Insurance. Each
policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds the right to
obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security covered by the
Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments including
futures, forward, swap and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. Although the Funds are authorized to invest in
such financial instruments, and may do so in the future, they did not make any
such investments during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Offering Costs

Nuveen Investments, LLC has agreed to pay all Common share offering costs (other
than the sales load) that exceed $.03 per Common share for Insured Dividend
Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA). Insured Dividend
Advantage's (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage's (NEA) share of Common share
offering costs ($615,654 and $555,000, respectively) were recorded as a
reduction of the proceeds from the sale of Common shares.

Costs incurred by Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) in connection with their offering of Preferred shares
($2,597,085 and $3,084,842, respectively) were recorded as a reduction to
paid-in surplus.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing income on taxable market
discount securities and timing differences in recognizing certain gains and
losses on security transactions.

At October 31, 2003, the cost of investments were as follows:

</TABLE>

Certain investments owned by the Funds are either covered by insurance issued by
several private insurers or are backed by an escrow or trust containing U.S.
Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both of which ensure the timely
payment of principal and interest in the event of default (100% for Insured
Quality (NQI), 100% for Insured Opportunity (NIO), 100% for Premier Insured
Income (NIF), 100% for Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX), 88% for Insured Dividend
Advantage (NVG) and 89% for Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA)). Such insurance or
escrow, however, does not guarantee the market value of the municipal securities
or the value of any of the Funds' shares.

                       AUTOMATICALLY

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.



NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price
per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBILITY

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A description of the policies and procedures that the Funds use to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (i) without
charge, upon request, by calling Nuveen Investments at (800) 257-8787; and (ii)
on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

POLICY CHANGE

On November 14, 2002, the Board adopted a policy that allows these Funds, in
addition to investments in municipal bonds, to invest up to 5% of its net assets
(including assets attributable to preferred shares, if any) in tax-exempt or
taxable fixed-income securities or equity securities for the purpose of
acquiring control of an issuer whose municipal bonds (a) the Fund already owns
and (b) have deteriorated or are expected shortly to deteriorate significantly
in credit quality, provided Nuveen Advisory determines that such investment
should enable the Fund to better maximize the value of its existing investment
in such issuer. This policy is a non-fundamental policy of each Fund which means
that it can be changed at any time by the Board of Trustees without vote of the
shareholders.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

Average Annual Total Return: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return (including change in NAV and reinvested dividends) that
would have been necessary on an annual basis to equal the investment's actual
performance over the time period being considered.

Average Effective Maturity: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

Leverage-Adjusted Duration: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's
duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates
change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for
a Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund.

Market Yield (also known as Dividend Yield or Current Yield): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

Net Asset Value (NAV): A fund's NAV is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
of the fund from its total assets and then dividing the remainder by the number
of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

Taxable-Equivalent Yield: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

- ---------
Each Fund intends to repurchase shares of its own common or preferred stock in
the future at such times and in such amounts as is deemed advisable. No shares
were repurchased during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003. Any future
repurchases will be reported to shareholders in the next annual or semiannual
report.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

In the rare event that a municipal issuer held by the Fund were to issue a proxy
or that the Fund were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security,
Nuveen Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser") would either engage an independent third
party to determine how the proxy should be voted or vote the proxy with the
consent, or based on the instructions, of the Fund's Board of Directors or
Trustees or its representative. In the case of a conflict of interest, the proxy
would be submitted to the applicable Fund's Board to determine how the proxy
should be voted. A member of the Adviser's legal department would oversee the
administration of the voting, and ensure that records were maintained in
accordance with Rule 204-2(c)(2) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (17
CFR 275.204-2(c)(2)), reports were filed with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the

          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act

                                  CERTIFICATION

I, Gifford R. Zimmerman, certify that:

     1. I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Nuveen Insured Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund;

     2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were
made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

     3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and cash
flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement of cash
flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

     4. The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and
have:

     (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     (c)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
