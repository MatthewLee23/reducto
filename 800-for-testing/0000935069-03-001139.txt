    1. ORGANIZATION

       UBS Technology Partners,  L.L.C.  (formerly,  UBS PW Technology Partners,
       L.L.C.) (the  "Fund") was  initially  organized as a limited  partnership
       under the laws of  Delaware on  December  28,  1998 and was  subsequently
       reorganized as a limited  liability  company  effective October 15, 2002.
       The Fund is  registered  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as
       amended (the "1940 Act"),  as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
       investment  company.  The  Fund's  investment  objective  is to  maximize
       capital appreciation over the long-term.  The Fund pursues its investment
       objective  by  deploying  its assets  primarily  among a select  group of
       portfolio  managers  who  invest  primarily  in,  or who have  particular
       knowledge  within,  the  technology  sector.  Generally,  such  portfolio
       managers   conduct  their  investment   programs   through   unregistered
       investment funds (collectively, the "Investment Funds") in which the Fund
       invests as a limited  partner or member along with other  investors.  The
       Fund commenced operations on April 1, 1999.

       The  Fund's   Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has   overall
       responsibility  to manage and control the  business  affairs of the Fund,
       including  the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies
       regarding the management,  conduct and operation of the Fund's  business.
       The Directors have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (formerly,  PW Fund
       Advisor, L.L.C.) (the "Manager" or "UBSFA"), a Delaware limited liability
       company  and the  Manager  of the  Fund,  to  provide  investment  advice
       regarding the selection of Investment Funds and the responsibility of the
       day-to-day management of the Fund.

       The Manager is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc.,
       which is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG. The Manager is
       registered as an investment adviser under the Investment  Advisers Act of
       1940, as amended.

       Initial and additional  applications for interests by eligible  investors
       may be  accepted  at such  times as the  Manager  may  determine  and are
       generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund  reserves the right to reject any
       application for interests in the Fund.

       The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests pursuant to
       written tenders to Members.  These repurchases will be made at such times
       and on  such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Directors,  in  their
       complete and exclusive discretion. The Manager expects that generally, it
       will  recommend  to the  Directors  that  the Fund  offer  to  repurchase
       interests  from Members  twice in each year,  near mid-year and year-end.
       Members can only  transfer or assign their  membership  interests  (i) by
       operation  of  law  pursuant  to the  death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or
       dissolution  of a  Member,  or (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of the
       Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and absolute discretion.

                                                                               5

    2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

       Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the direction of the
       Manager as of the close of  business  at the end of any fiscal  period in
       accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be
       determined  from time to time  pursuant  to policies  established  by the
       Directors.

       The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms and
       conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering memoranda,
       as appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are carried at
       fair value as  determined  by the  Fund's  pro-rata  interest  in the net
       assets  of  each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations   utilize  financial
       information  supplied by each  Investment  Fund and are net of management
       and performance  incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment
       Funds'  managers or pursuant to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The
       underlying  investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair
       value as described in each Investment Fund's financial statements.

       Distributions received or withdrawn from Investment Funds, whether in the
       form of cash or  securities,  are first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
       investment's cost.

       B. INCOME RECOGNITION

       Interest  income is  recorded on the accrual  basis.  Realized  gains and
       losses from Investment Fund transactions are calculated on the identified
       cost basis.

       C. FUND COSTS

       The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including, but not
       limited to, the  following:  all costs and expenses  related to portfolio
       transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting
       and auditing  fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing  the Fund's net
       asset  value;  costs  of  insurance;   registration   expenses;   certain
       organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related expenses;
       expenses of meetings of Directors and Members;  all costs with respect to
       communications  to Members;  and other types of expenses  approved by the
       Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.

       D. INCOME TAXES

       No provision for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
       been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member
       is individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive
       share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

       E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

       Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank, NA
       account  which pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost plus
       accrued  interest  which  is  included  in  interest  receivable  on  the
       Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

       F. USE OF ESTIMATES

       The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with  accounting
       principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America  requires
       the Manager to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
       reported in the financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Manager
       believes  that the estimates  utilized in preparing the Fund's  financial
       statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
       differ from these estimates.

    3. MANAGEMENT FEE, PERFORMANCE BONUS, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

       UBSFA  provides  certain  management and  administrative  services to the
       Fund,  including,  among other things,  providing  office space and other
       support services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays UBSFA
       a monthly  management  fee (the  "Fee")  at an  annual  rate of 1% of the
       Fund's net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Manager's capital
       account.  The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's  assets and  debited
       against the Members' capital  accounts,  excluding the Manager's  capital
       account. A portion of the fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

       UBS Financial  Services,  Inc.  ("UBS FSI")  (formerly,  UBS  PaineWebber
       Inc.),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,  acts  as a
       placement agent for the Fund, without special compensation from the Fund,
       and bears its own  costs  associated  with its  activities  as  placement
       agent.  Placement  fees,  if any,  charged on  contributions  are debited
       against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a net subscription amount.
       The placement fee does not constitute assets of the Fund.

       The  net  increase  (or  decrease)  in  members'   capital  derived  from
       operations  (net income or loss) is  initially  allocated  to the capital
       accounts of all Members on a pro-rata basis,  other than the Fee which is
       similarly  allocated  to all Members  other than the Manager as described
       above. In accordance with the Limited  Liability Company  Agreement,  the
       Manager is then allocated an amount based on the  performance of the Fund
       (the "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement  Period, as defined in the
       Confidential  Memorandum (i.e., the period commencing on the admission of
       a Member to the Fund,  and thereafter  each period  commencing on the day
       following the last  Measurement  Period and ending generally on the first
       to occur of (1) a fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial  redemption).
       The  Performance  Bonus is  calculated  separately  with  respect to each
       Member.

                                                                               7

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    3. MANAGEMENT FEE, PERFORMANCE BONUS, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
       (CONTINUED)

       The  Performance  Bonus  is equal to 1% of the  balance  of the  Member's
       capital  account  at the end of the  Measurement  Period,  provided  that
       appreciation  in the Member's  capital  account  (net of any  Performance
       Bonus) exceeds the Member's threshold return. The threshold return is the
       amount  that a Member  would  have  earned  for a  fiscal  year if it had
       received  an  annualized  rate of  return of 20% on its  opening  capital
       account balance, as adjusted. No Performance Bonus was earned for the six
       months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002.

       Each Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined
       by the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer  of $5,000 plus a fee for
       each meeting  attended.  Any Director who is an "interested  person" does
       not  receive  any annual or other fee from the Fund.  All  Directors  are
       reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total
       amounts  expensed  related  to  Directors  by the Fund for the six months
       ended June 30, 2003 were $10,500.

       PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as custodian of
       the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Fund.

       PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as Administrator and
       Accounting  Agent  to the  Fund  and in that  capacity  provides  certain
       administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax and investor  related
       services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee primarily based upon (i) the
       average net assets of the Fund,  subject to a minimum  monthly  fee,  and
       (ii) the aggregate  net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment
       funds  sponsored  or  advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc.  or it  affiliates.
       Additionally, the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred
       by PFPC, Inc.

    4. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

       Aggregate  purchases  and sales of  Investment  Funds for the six  months
       ended  June  30,  2003,   amounted  to  $118,500,000  and   $224,701,691,
       respectively.

       The cost of  investments  for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
       items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds.
       The allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the  Investment
       Funds on Schedule K-1.

    5. INVESTMENTS

       As of June 30, 2003, the Fund had investments in Investment  Funds,  none
       of which were related  parties.  The Fund's  investments  are  summarized
