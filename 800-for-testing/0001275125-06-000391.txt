GLOBAL MARKET OVERVIEW

SWISS MARKET REVIEW AND FUND PERFORMANCE
    After a strong start for the second quarter, global equity markets had a
severe and abrupt correction in the May and June period. The end of earnings
season was the trigger for a move, which had been in the making, caused by
investor anticipation that corporate earnings and margins may have peaked. It
was also becoming more and more obvious that the central banks had embarked on
a program to remove excess liquidity from the marketplace as consumer price
indices began to indicate increasing inflationary pressures. Unlike previous
corrections during the cyclical bull market that started in 2003, however,
government bonds did not benefit from a flight to quality. While part of this
can be explained by investors' fears of creeping inflation, it was at odds with
their worries that the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") was going to trigger a
recession by increasing interest rates too much. Volatility also increased
because the central banks' bias toward tightening had become much more data
dependent than in the recent past.

    The large drawdown happened both globally and across industry sectors with
high risk assets suffering the most. Emerging markets were the worst hit with a
26% correction in the iShares Emerging Markets Index from early May to early
June. The United States equity market was the least affected due to
anticipation that the FRB was getting closer to a pause in its campaign to
raise interest rates and also due to the previous lukewarm performance of U.S.
stocks.

    The Swiss market was not an exception to this downward trend despite the
heavy presence of food and pharmaceutical companies considered as defensive.
Swiss large capitalization companies were down 12% and Swiss mid-sized
companies were down 17% during the period. Among the sectors that were the
worst affected were, understandably, industrials goods and services (with a
decline of 23%, which was almost as much as the emerging markets as a whole),
banks (down 18% due to sensitivity to the capital market cycle of their
investment banking and asset management operations) and insurance (with a
similar decline, although probably less warranted). The sectors that were the
least affected were healthcare (with a drop of 6%) and food (with a negative
performance of only 5%).

    Despite the sudden change in market conditions (which witnessed a steep
115% increase in the Swiss Market Index implied volatility index), losses were
contained and no real chain effect of forced liquidation by leveraged players
was reported. The sell-off was definitely more of a market event than an
economic event. The market situation stabilized somewhat towards the end of
June and leadership was assumed by large capitalization stocks with defensive
characteristics.

    Reporting season was strong in Switzerland for the first quarter of the
year and management comments were reassuring.

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

Investors, nonetheless, had to witness a contraction in the valuation of the
cyclical sectors of the market, as stock prices stopped their upward movement
despite upbeat earnings releases. This, together with private equity fund
successes in raising capital for buy outs, are among the many signs of a
typical peak in the business cycle and investor sentiment.

    Management has started to reduce the Fund's position in the cyclical
sectors, especially in the mid and small capitalization areas, and to reinforce
the Fund's exposure to the mid cap healthcare sector. This tactical shift has
created a sizeable cash position. Management will reinvest it opportunistically
in higher quality names.

    The outperformance of large cap defensive stocks penalized the Fund's
performance as compared to the Swiss Performance Index ("SPI"). During the last
two months, only four stocks of the twenty seven in the large cap Swiss Market
Index ("SMI") had positive performance: Roche, Nestle, Basilea and Serono. The
Fund was also invested in sectors trading at historical low valuations
(insurance) and in restructuring stories with equally low valuations (e.g. ABB
and Adecco). Their discount to management's estimated fair value was not
enough, however, to protect these investments from macro risk and they
underperformed the market during the last part of the quarter under review.

SWISS MARKET CORPORATE NEWS
    In terms of corporate activity during the quarter the following
transactions are of note:

    Nestle continued to follow its strategic focus to move towards nutrition,
health and wellness. On May 23, 2006, Nestle agreed to acquire Uncle Tobys
business in Australia for 890 million Australian dollars in cash. Uncle Tobys
is active in breakfast cereals, nutritious snacks and instant soups, as well as
the rights to brand in New Zealand. As a result of this transaction, Nestle
becomes number one in nutritious snacks and number two in instant soups in
Australia exceeded only by Campbell's. In addition, on June 19, 2006, Nestle
reached agreement to acquire Jenny Craig, a weight management company offering
consumers a range of branded nutritional products and services, for $600
million.

    On June 14, 2006, Axa agreed to buy Credit Suisse Group's Winterthur unit
for $9.9 billion in cash. Later in the year Credit Suisse will disclose how it
will re-invest its proceeds and, specifically, how it will maintain its 2007
profit target without the contribution from Winterthur.

    On May 9, 2006, UBS, increased its long term commitment to emerging markets
investments and announced that it was acquiring Banco Pactual S.A, a Brazilian
investment bank and one of Brazil's leading equity and bond underwriters. The
payment of up to $2.6 billion will be done in two parts (an initial payment of
$1 billion with another payment of $1.6 billion in five years based on the
bank's ability to meet certain performance targets).

    On May 25, 2006, UBS announced an acquisition of ABN AMRO's global futures

and options business for $386 million in cash. This acquisition will position
UBS as a market leader in the futures and options industry.

FUND NEWS
    At the Fund's annual meeting on June 8, 2006, the stockholders approved
changes to the Fund's fundamental investment policies and restrictions to
permit the Fund to leverage up to 10% of its total assets (including the amount
borrowed); to invest in equity and equity-linked securities issued by Swiss
real estate companies (including real estate investment trusts ("REITs") or
REIT-like structures), to acquire equity and equity-linked securities of
non-Swiss companies in limited instances, and to engage in certain options
transactions.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
    At its last monetary policy assessment on June 15, 2006, the Swiss National
Bank ("SNB") once again increased the target range for the three-month London
Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") by 0.25 percentage points to 1.0%-2.0%. The SNB
is continuing to align its monetary policy course into line with economic
activity, ensuring that the inflation outlook remains favorable.

    The increase in real Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") in the first quarter
was 0.9% quarter to quarter and 3.5% versus the prior year, a level last
reached in 2000. The SNB increased its forecast for increases in real GDP for
the year from an average rate of over 2% to an average rate of over 2.5% for
the year. The SNB also increased its inflation forecast from 1% to 1.2% for the
year, assuming a three-month LIBOR of 1.5%. Inflation, therefore, is expected
to remain lower than the SNB target of 2%.

    Along with the increase in short-term yields, long term rates continued
their upward movement. The yield on the 10-year Swiss Confederation bond
increased by 34 basis points from the end of last quarter, resulting in a rate
of 2.82% at the end of this quarter. Short term real interest rates remained
positive at 0.7% in the first quarter, equal to the rate in the preceding
quarter.

    The KOF (Swiss Institute for Business Cycle Research) economic barometer
indicates the development of overall economic output relative to the previous
year. At the moment it is showing a continued positive trend. According to the
results of the KOF's economic surveys, expectations within the Swiss industrial
sector are weakening. However, the retail sector is showing a rise in sales
expectations. Reinforcing these readings, corresponding economic surveys
conducted by the EU Commission continue to point to an improvement in
industrial activity in key EU countries, a favorable prospect for Swiss exports.

CURRENCIES
    The US dollar lost about 7% in relation to the Swiss franc during the
second quarter of 2006. During the same period, the Swiss franc remained more
or less stable in comparison to the euro, mainly due to similarities in
monetary policy decisions.

OUTLOOK / STRATEGY
    The Swiss market's valuations are in line with or slightly lower than
historical averages, similar to the valuations of most markets in the developed
economies. This valuation level, however, assumes an 11% increase in earnings
per share for the whole market for 2007, following a 14% increase in 2006. This
appears to be rather ambitious. If earnings growth expectations are lowered to
8% for 2007, the equity risk premium (earnings yield minus high quality
corporate bond yields) would still be comfortably positive, allowing for an
increase of government yields and credit spread.

    The medium-term outlook for the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar is
unclear. On the one hand European economies are still in an uptrend, even
though they are topping out, and the US economy is clearly decelerating. This
should support the Swiss franc as interest rate differentials, currently in
favor of the US dollar, get smaller. On the other hand, a higher risk level for
global economic growth could lead to capital flowing back to the US from
emerging markets and Europe, supporting the US dollar. As its economy slows,
the US trade deficit will benefit from lower US imports and higher US exports
to a still vibrant international economy. This should, at least temporarily,
help the dollar.

    As mentioned above, there are multiple signs indicating a potential decline
in the business cycle. Euro futures, for example, indicate that the market is
already pricing in a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next year. Economies in
Japan, Europe and emerging markets countries are still strong, but the central
banks' reaction to lagging indicators, such as inflation, is creating a strong
headwind for these economies. In particular, as the emerging market cycle
matures, the question will be whether Japan and Europe can absorb excess supply
created by reduced U.S. consumer spending and mitigate the global economic
slowdown. Historically, a Fed pause is not followed by strong performance of
riskier assets, including emerging market equities. A slowing US economy will
also have a negative impact on European export oriented sectors, which are
heavily represented in European stock indices.

    On a more positive note, valuations are equal to or lower than historical
averages. A

Letter to Stockholders (concluded)

soft landing of the U.S. economy next year (instead of a few quarters of
negative growth) would trigger some upside for equities.

    Management's strategy is to continue to reduce exposure to industrial
companies unless their valuation is low enough to offset the systemic risk
represented by a slowing global economy. The financial services sector will be
a key factor in the performance of the market. Management is looking at a
number of factors in determining its investment strategy with regard to this
sector. Swiss private and investment banks are exposed to the negative effects
of a slowdown in capital market activities resulting from a tightening monetary
policy. In addition increased volatility and risk premiums are negative for
equities, the high margin portion of the private banking business. Finally, the
compression of long term rates would reduce margins for new business in the
life insurance sector and higher inflation would penalize the non-life
insurance sector. Management is closely monitoring the defensive quality of
some asset managers (alternative products), and the impact of the growth in
derivative products used to mitigate market risk. Overall the financial sector
requires a careful investment approach. As a result the Fund's exposure to
sectors with low earnings volatility and relatively low expectations is
expected to increase.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
    Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market
purchases of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1999
and has continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of
the stock repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the
Fund's net asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect
upon the Fund's expense ratio. The Board has authorized the Fund to repurchase
up to 1,000,000 shares during 2006. During the six months ended June 30, 2006,
the Fund repurchased and retired 76,700 shares at an average price of $16.04
per share (including brokerage commissions) and a weighted average discount of
11.71%. These repurchases, which had a total cost of $1,230,030, resulted in an
increase of $168,821 to the Fund's net asset value.

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.

The Fund also may acquire and hold equity and equity-linked securities of
non-Swiss companies in the limited instance where: (1) the Fund holds an
investment in a Swiss company, and (2) such Swiss company undergoes a merger,
takeover, reorganization or other form of business combination with a non-Swiss
issuer (a "reorganization"), or reorganizes (or "redomiciles") itself as a new
corporate entity outside of Switzerland, and (3) the Fund, as a shareholder in
the Swiss company, acquires equity or equity-linked securities in the non-Swiss
issuer as a result of the transaction. The Fund would be permitted, but not
required, to reacquire equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies
that have redomiciled, so long as the Fund held an investment in the Swiss
company at or before the time the company redomiciled.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity
securities that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund
uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities, the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. If a current bid price is not
available, the Fund uses the mean between the latest quoted bid and asked
prices. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the responsibility of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") to
establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that
are available are considered unreliable, the Fund determines a fair value in
good faith in accordance with these procedures. The Fund may use these
procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund
may value the securities at their last reported price or at some other value.
There were no fair valued securities on June 30, 2006.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend income, net of any foreign taxes withheld, is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated expenses are also accrued
daily.

The Fund records Swiss withholding tax as a reduction of dividend income, net
of any amount reclaimable from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax
treaty between the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends annually to the extent it has any net investment income
and net realized gains from foreign currency transactions and makes
distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed any
capital loss carryforwards. The Fund determines the size and nature of these
distributions in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Distributions may be paid either in cash or in stock with an option to take
cash. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its books on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and
to distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Therefore, no federal
income tax provision is required. See Note 5 for Federal income tax treatment
of foreign currency gains/losses.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles.

F. SECURITIES LENDING INCOME
The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions. The Fund retains
beneficial ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any changes in their market value. For the initial transaction, the Fund
requires the borrowers of the securities to establish collateral with the Fund
in the form of cash and/or government securities equal to 105% of the value of
the securities loaned. Subsequent to the initial transaction, the Fund requires
the borrowers to maintain collateral with the Fund equal to 100% of the value
of the securities loaned. The Fund receives fees as compensation for lending
its securities. Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the securities
loan at any time. There were no securities on loan during the period ended June
30, 2006.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting records in U.S. dollars. The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and
transactions by using prevailing exchange rates. The cost basis of foreign
denominated assets & liabilities is determined on the date that they are first
recorded within the Fund and translated to U.S. dollars. These assets and
liabilities are subsequently valued each day at prevailing exchange rates. The
difference between the original cost and current value denominated in U.S.
dollars is recorded as Unrealized Currency Gain/Loss. In valuing assets and
liabilities, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing securities transactions, the receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations
shown on the Fund's financial statements result from the sale of foreign
currencies, from currency gains or losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between
the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on
the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid.

When calculating realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in
equity securities, the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the foreign currency price of the security from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain
(loss) are disclosed separately.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

I. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (the
"Interpretation") which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the effective date.
This Interpretation prescribes a minimum threshold for financial statement
recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return, and requires certain expanded disclosures. Management has recently
begun to evaluate the application of the Interpretation to the Fund, and has
not at this time determined the impact, if any, resulting from the adoption of
this Interpretation on the Fund's financial statements.

NOTE 2--FEES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Hottinger Capital Corp. ("HCC"), which is owned jointly by Hottinger U.S., Inc.
and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich), is the Fund's advisor (the "Advisor"). The Fund
pays the Advisor an annual fee based on its month-end net assets which is
calculated and paid monthly at the following annual rates: 1.00% of the first
$60 million, 0.90% of the next $40 million, 0.80% of the next $100 million,
0.70% of the next $100 million, 0.65% of the next $100 million, 0.60% of the
next $100 million, 0.55% of the next $100 million, and 0.50% of such assets in
excess of $600 million. The Fund paid the Advisor $1,749,664 in investment
advisory fees for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The Fund paid Hottinger &
Cie (Zurich) $30,917 in brokerage commissions for the six months ended June 30,
2006.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

The Fund and the Advisor have agreed to share certain common expenses subject
to review and allocation by the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board.
During the period ending June 30, 2006, the Committee allocated $60,512 of
expenses incurred in connection with publicizing the Fund as follows: $38,156
to the Fund and $22,356 to the Advisor.

Certain officers and directors of the Fund are also officers or directors of
HCC, Hottinger U.S., Inc. and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich). These persons are not
paid by the Fund for serving in these capacities.

NOTE 3--OTHER FEES
Citigroup Fund Services, LLC ("Citigroup") provides certain administration and
portfolio accounting services to the Fund.

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the Fund's transfer agent. The Fund
pays the transfer agent an annual fee which is accrued daily and paid monthly.
Swiss American Securities Inc. is the Fund's U.S. custodian. Credit Suisse
First Boston is the Fund's Swiss sub-custodian. The Fund pays the custodian and
sub-custodian an annual fee.

The Fund pays each director who is not an "interested person" (as such term is
defined in the Act) of the Fund, the Advisor, or Citigroup, approximately
$23,800 per annum in compensation, except for the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee and the Governance/Nominating Committee, to whom the Fund pays an
annual fee of approximately $28,800. In addition, the Fund pays each
non-interested director $1,300 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for
each committee meeting attended, if it is held separately. In addition, the
Fund reimburses directors who are not employees of or affiliated with the
Advisor for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in conjunction with attendance at
meetings.

Directors' fees and expenses payable of $130,265 shown on the Statements of
Assets & Liabilities represents total dollars owed to Directors that have been
accrued and not paid. Directors' fees and expenses of $309,932 shown on the
Statement of Operations represent the portion of Directors' fees and expenses
accrued during the period January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006. These fees are
calculated by projecting Directors' fee contractually owed and adding estimates
of reimbursable expenses based on historical activity.

NOTE 4--CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS
The Fund is authorized to issue up to 50 million shares of capital stock. The
Advisor owned 128,435 of the 24,751,755 shares outstanding on June 30, 2006.

NOTE 6--STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1999 and has
continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio. The Board has authorized the Fund to repurchase up to
1,000,000 shares during 2006. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the
Fund repurchased and retired 76,700 shares at an average price of $16.04 per
share (including brokerage commissions) and a weighted average discount of
11.71%. These repurchases, which had a total cost of $1,230,030, resulted in an
increase of $168,821 to the Fund's net asset value.

NOTE 7--PROXY VOTING INFORMATION
A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to determine
how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available, without
charge and upon request, by calling 1-888-SWISS-00 and on the SEC's website at

ended June 30 is available, without charge and upon request, by calling
1-888-SWISS-00 or by visiting the Fund's website at www.swz.com. This
information is also available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.

NOTE 8--AVAILABILITY OF QUARTERLY PORTFOLIO SCHEDULES
The Fund files its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the
first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Fund's Form N-Q
is available, without charge and upon request, by visiting the Fund's website
at www.swz.com and on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov or may be
reviewed and copied at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC.
Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by
calling (800) SEC-0330.

NOTE 9--ADVISORY AGREEMENT APPROVAL
The continuance of the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and HCC
(the "Agreement") was approved by the Board at a meeting on June 8, 2006. The
Independent Directors met with representatives of HCC before the meeting and
evaluated information that they deemed necessary to enable them to determine
that the Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement") would be in the best
interests of the Fund and its stockholders. Their evaluation included
information concerning the Fund's performance and expenses (including the fees
paid to HCC for its services), the nature, extent and quality of the services
HCC provided to the Fund, the financial position and profitability of HCC, and
other benefits that HCC or its parent derived from managing the Fund.

The Independent Directors reviewed the Fund's investment performance,
determining that the relevant measures should be in terms of its net asset
value as measured in Swiss francs because the Fund's portfolio securities and
cash were denominated in Swiss francs and because, as a matter of policy, the
Fund did not hedge its currency exposure. They compared the Fund's one- and
three-year investment performance as well as its longer term performance with
the Swiss Performance Index ("SPI"), with the performance of the Swiss iShares
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and with the performance of a peer group
of equity investment funds of comparable or larger size managed by Swiss
advisers with publicly available performance information. Because the iShares
performance was stated in U.S. dollar terms, the comparison of the Fund's
performance with the performance of iShares was on that basis. In comparing the
Fund's performance with the performance of the SPI, they considered the fact
that, unlike the Fund, the performance of the SPI did not include the impact of
any expenses. As a result of this evaluation, they concluded that the Fund's
performance for the four months of 2006 and each of the nine years ended 2005
was reasonable in relation to the comparisons and outperformed them for the
four-month 2006 period and on a cumulative basis.

The Independent Directors expressed concern with the market price per share of
the Fund relative to its net asset value per share, but determined that this
was essentially unrelated to HCC's investment performance.

The Independent Directors also evaluated the fees HCC charged the Fund for
investment advisory services as compared to the fees paid by U.S. registered
closed-end European country funds. They determined that the fees paid to HCC,
even when combined with the seven basis point administration fee paid to the
Fund's unaffiliated administrator, were

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (concluded)

among the lowest in each group. HCC also had represented that the combined
investment advisory fee and administration fee was also lower than the fees
HCC's parent charged to its private advisory clients and to a Luxembourg-based
fund it managed with similar investment objectives and strategies.

The Independent Directors separately considered the fees charged by HCC
including breakpoints at various asset levels. They concluded that the
breakpoints (which were voluntarily adjusted by HCC in 1995 to the benefit of
the Fund) allowed the Fund to share in economies of scale as its assets grow.
The Independent Directors evaluated the nature of the Fund, the creativity of
HCC in developing the Fund's investment strategies, and the complexity of the
Swiss securities market. They determined that HCC's services to the Fund were
highly professional and that the qualifications and number of HCC personnel,
the availability of company research and market and financial information from
HCC's parent in Switzerland, and the continuity of HCC personnel over time were
all desirable factors.

The Independent Directors considered the financial condition of HCC, noting
that the advisory fees it received from the Fund comprised the majority of its
income. They concluded that HCC's financial condition was sound and that its
profitability was reasonable for the services it provided to the Fund. They
considered other benefits that HCC or its parent could be considered to derive
from their relationship with the Fund including limited brokerage commissions
from executing Fund transactions, the marketing value of the Fund's performance
in attracting other clients, and the cost benefits to HCC of soft dollar
research and portfolio and financial information services. They determined that
these benefits were relatively minor and did not affect their overall
assessment of the reasonableness of the relationship.

Based on the evaluation of these factors and the assistance of independent
legal counsel, the Independent Directors concluded that the Fund's advisory fee
rate was reasonable in relation to the service to be rendered by HCC and
therefore recommended that the Board approve the continuance of the Agreement.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

The Plan
The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest capital gains distributions and ordinary income dividends,
payable in whole or in part in cash, in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:
   . Once you enroll in the Plan, all of your future distributions and
     dividends payable in whole or in part in cash will be automatically
     reinvested in Fund shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
   . You will receive shares valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset value
     or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount of your
     distribution or dividend will be reinvested automatically in additional
     Fund shares. For any balance that is insufficient to purchase full shares
     of the Fund, your account will be credited with fractional shares.
   . Your shares will be held in an account with the Plan agent. You will be
     sent regular statements for your records.
   . You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

   The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

How do I enroll in the Plan?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (AST) at the address shown below. If your shares are
held in a brokerage account, contact your broker. Not all brokerage firms
permit their clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the
Plan and, even if your brokerage firm does permit participation, you may not be
able to transfer your Plan shares to another broker who does not permit
participation. Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its
policies.

How does the Plan work?
The cash portion of any dividends or distributions you receive, payable in
whole or in part in cash, will be reinvested in shares of the Fund. The number
of shares credited to your Plan account as a result of the reinvestment will
depend upon the relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset
value per share on the record date of the distribution or dividend, as

   . If the net asset value is greater than the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a discount), AST, as Plan Agent, will buy Fund shares for your
     account on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     Your dividends or distributions will be reinvested at the average price
     AST pays for those purchases.
   . If the net asset value is equal to the market price (the Fund is trading
     at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at net asset
     value.
   . If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
     (the Fund is trading at a premium of less than 5%), the Fund will issue
     for your account new shares at net asset value.
   . If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a premium of 5% or more), the Fund will issue for your account
     new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST begins to buy Fund shares for your account at a discount to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price
increases to a level above the net asset

value, AST will complete its purchases, even though the result may be that the
average price paid for the purchases exceeds net asset value.

Will the entire amount of my distribution or dividend be reinvested?
The entire amount of your distribution or dividend, payable in cash, will be
reinvested in additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase
of whole shares, your account will be credited with any fractional shares
(rounded to three decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

How can I sell my shares?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan account by contacting AST.
AST charges $15 for the transaction plus $.10 per share for this service. You
can also withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

Does participation in the Plan change the tax status of my distributions or
dividends?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is
the same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of
distributions and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

Can I get certificates for the shares in the Plan?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates
for fractional shares will not be issued.

Is there any charge to participate in the Plan?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to AST's open market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

How can I discontinue my participation in the Plan?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account,
AST will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any
fractional shares.

Where can I direct my questions and correspondence?
Contact your broker, or contact AST as follows:
   By mail:
     American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
     PO Box 922
     Wall Street Station
     New York, NY 10269-0560
   Through the Internet:

AST will furnish you with a copy of the Terms and Conditions of the Plan
without charge.
