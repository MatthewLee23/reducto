Chairman's

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photo of: Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Timothy R. Schwertfeger
Chairman of the Board

It is with a variety  of  emotions  that I write my last  letter to Nuveen  Fund
shareholders.  For a dozen  years,  it has  been  my  privilege  to  communicate
periodically  with you through  these annual and  semi-annual  reports about the
performance  and uses of your Fund.  Over that time, I've tried to emphasize the
central  role  that  quality  municipal  bonds can play in  creating  attractive
opportunities  for  current  tax-free  income,  long-term  return and  portfolio
diversification.  I firmly  believe that all our Fund  shareholders,  working in
conjunction with a trusted financial advisor,  have the potential to reach their
financial   objectives  by  using  Nuveen  Funds  as  a  core   component  of  a
well-balanced portfolio.

As I noted in your  Fund's  last  shareholder  report,  Nuveen  Investments  was
acquired  in November  2007 by a group led by Madison  Dearborn  Partners,  LLC.
While  this  event  had  no  impact  on  the  investment  objectives,  portfolio
management  strategies  or  dividend  policies  of your Fund,  it did  provide a
convenient point to begin  implementing a long-planned  transition in the senior
management  team at Nuveen.  As a part of this  process,  I will be leaving  the
Board of the Nuveen Funds on June 30, 2008.

In addition,  Nuveen and your Fund's  Board  determined  that Fund  shareholders
would be best served by having an independent director serve as the new chairman
of the Fund  Board.  Therefore,  I am very  excited and pleased to report that I
will be  succeeded  as chairman of your Nuveen Fund Board by Robert  Bremner.  A
member of the Board  since  1997,  Bob is a  management  consultant  and private
investor not affiliated  with Nuveen.  Over the years,  he has played a critical
role on the Fund Board,  most recently as the lead independent  director,  and I
know Bob and the other Board  members are  determined  to maintain the standards
and  commitment  to  quality  that you have  come to  expect  from  your  Nuveen
investment.

Please  take the time to review the  Portfolio  Manager's  Comments,  the Common
Share  Dividend  and  Share  Price  Information,  and the  Performance  Overview
sections of this  report.  All of us are  grateful  that you have chosen  Nuveen
Investments as a partner as you pursue your financial  goals,  and, on behalf of
Bob  Bremner  and the other  members of your  Fund's  Board,  let me say we look
forward to continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Portfolio Manager's COMMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds |  NQI, NIO, NIF,
                                              |  NPX, NVG, NEA

Portfolio  manager  Paul  Brennan  reviews  key  investment  strategies  and the
six-month  performance  of these six  insured  Funds.  With 19 years of industry
experience,  including  17 years at Nuveen,  Paul assumed  portfolio  management
responsibility for the six insured Funds in 2006.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX-MONTH
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2008?

During this six-month period, the municipal market experienced a great deal of
volatility, as issues related to the sub-prime mortgage industry had an
indirect, but important, influence on the municipal market's performance. The
continued uncertainty about municipal bond insurers contributed to a turbulent
municipal market environment, as did tighter liquidity stemming from problems in
the credit markets. We sought to capitalize on this environment by continuing to
focus on relative value, using a fundamental approach to find undervalued
sectors and individual credits with the potential to perform well over the long
term.

As the market discounted bonds that were out of favor, such as credits backed by
certain municipal bond insurers or bonds with investment characteristics
perceived to have more risk exposure, we took advantage of opportunities that we
considered overlooked and undervalued to selectively add these types of bonds to
our portfolios.

In addition, we believed that the steepening municipal yield curve began to
offer better reward opportunities for purchases made further out on the curve.
As a result, many of the additions to our portfolios emphasized longer
maturities. We also added exposure to the short end of the yield curve by
purchasing variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) at very attractive yields.
VRDOs are floating-rate securities that offer interest rates set daily or weekly
based on an index of short-term municipal rates. Our purchase activity during
this period was directed toward bonds with unusual structures and
characteristics that we believed represented opportunities to add value, manage
duration and volatility and support the Funds' income streams.

To generate cash for purchases, we selectively sold some holdings with shorter
durations,(1) including pre-refunded bonds,(2) at attractive prices resulting
from high demand. Selling shorter duration bonds and reinvesting further out on
the yield curve also helped to improve the Funds' overall call protection
profiles. In addition, a number of our new purchases were funded with cash
generated by bond redemptions.

Discussions of specific investments are for illustrative purposes only and are
not intended as recommendations of individual investments. The views expressed
in this commentary represent those of the portfolio manager as of the date of
this report and are subject to change at any time, based on market conditions
and other factors. The Funds disclaim any obligation to advise shareholders of
such changes.

(1)  Duration  is a measure of a bond's  price  sensitivity  as  interest  rates
change,  with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these changes
than bonds with shorter durations.

(2) Advance refundings, also known as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur when
an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund  principal  and interest
payments of older existing bonds.  This process often results in lower borrowing
costs for bond issuers.

As noted earlier, over the course of the entire reporting period, we saw the
municipal yield curve steepen, as municipal bond interest rates at the short end
of the curve declined and longer rates rose. In this environment, we continued
to emphasize a disciplined approach to duration management. As part of this
strategy, we use inverse floating rate securities,(3) a type of derivative
financial instrument, in all six of these Funds. Inverse floaters typically
provide the dual benefit of bringing the Funds' durations closer to our
strategic target and enhancing their income-generation capabilities. Going into
this period, NPX also used forward interest rate swaps, another type of
derivative financial instrument. The goal of this strategy was to help us manage
NPX's common share net asset value (NAV) volatility without having a negative
impact on its income stream or common share dividends over the short term.

HOW DID THE FUNDS PERFORM?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as relevant index and peer group
information, are presented in the accompanying table.

For the six months ended April 30, 2008, the cumulative return on common share
NAV for all six Funds in this report underperformed the return on the Lehman
Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index. The six-month returns for NIO, NPX, NVG
and NEA exceeded the average return for the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds
Average, NIF performed in line with the peer group and NQI underperformed the
peer group average.

One of the major factors impacting the six-month performance of these Funds in
relation to that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index
was the use of financial leverage. While leverage provides opportunities for
additional income and total returns for common shareholders, the benefits of
leveraging are tied

*Six-month returns are cumulative; returns for one-year, five-year, and ten-year
are annualized.

Past performance is not predictive of future results. Current performance may be
higher or lower than the data shown.  Returns do not reflect  the  deduction  of
taxes that  shareholders may have to pay on Fund  distributions or upon the sale
of Fund shares.

For additional  information,  see the individual  Performance  Overview for your
Fund in this report.

(3) An inverse floating rate security is a financial  instrument designed to pay
long-term  tax-exempt interest at a rate that varies inversely with a short-term
tax-exempt  interest rate index.  For the Nuveen Funds, the index typically used
is the Securities  Industry and Financial  Markets  (SIFM)  Municipal Swap Index
(previously  referred to as the Bond Market  Association Index or BMA).  Inverse
floaters,  including  those inverse  floating rate securities in which the Funds
invested during this reporting  period,  are further defined within the Notes to
Financial  Statements and Glossary of Terms Used in This Report sections of this
shareholder report.

(4) The Lipper  Insured  Municipal  Debt Funds Average is  calculated  using the
returns of all closed-end  funds in this category for each period as follows:  6
months,  23; 1 year, 23; 5 years,  21; and 10 years, 16. Fund and Lipper returns
assume reinvestment of dividends.

(5)  The  Lehman  Brothers  Insured  Municipal  Bond  Index  is an  unleveraged,
unmanaged  national index  comprising a broad range of insured  municipal bonds.
Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

in part to the short-term rates that leveraged Funds pay their preferred
shareholders. The Funds' borrowing costs remained relatively high, negatively
impacting their total returns.

Another key factor with a major impact on the performances of these insured
Funds involved their relative exposures to bonds backed by municipal bond
insurers that had their credit ratings downgraded. As concern increased about
the balance sheets of these insurers, prices on bonds insured by these companies
declined for many insured bonds. Price declines were not limited to certain
insured bonds during this reporting period, many other bonds saw their prices
decline also. The concerns about the financial health of these bond insurers led
to poor investment performance relative to other comparable rated bonds.

Other factors that influenced the Funds' returns included yield curve and
duration positioning, the use of derivatives, and credit exposure and sector
allocations.

During this six-month period, bonds in the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index
with maturities of eight years or less, especially those maturing in two to six
years, benefited the most from changes in the interest rate environment. As a
result, these shorter maturity bonds generally outperformed credits with longer
maturities. Bonds having the longest maturities (22 years and longer) posted the
worst returns. As previously noted, one of our strategies during this period
focused on adding longer bonds to our portfolios as the yield curve steepened,
based on our belief that these bonds offered good long-term potential. This
purchase activity helped to extend the Funds' durations, which generally had a
negative impact on performance during this six months. Among these Funds, NVG
and NEA were better positioned in terms of duration, with less exposure to the
underperforming long part of the yield curve than the other four Funds in this
report.

As mentioned earlier, all six of these Funds used inverse floaters as part of
our duration management strategies. These inverse floaters negatively impacted
performance due to the fact that they effectively increased the Funds' exposure
to longer maturity bonds during a period when shorter maturities were in favor
in the market. However, the inverse floaters also benefited the Funds by helping
to support their income streams.

In general, bonds with higher credit quality, except those insured by the
troubled bond insurers, outperformed those with lower credit quality. The
underperformance of the lower quality sector was largely the result of
risk-averse investors' flight to quality as disruptions in the financial and
housing markets deepened. The performances of these six insured Funds generally
benefited from their higher quality holdings. This included pre-refunded bonds,
which performed exceptionally well due primarily to their shorter effective
maturities and higher credit quality. Among these Funds, NVG, NEA, and NIO had
the heaviest weightings of pre-refunded bonds, while NQI held the fewest of
these bonds. Sectors of the market that generally contributed positively to the
Funds' performances included general obligation bonds, water and sewer, electric
utilities and special tax issues.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING BOND INSURANCE COMPANIES AND FUND POLICY CHANGES

The portfolios of investments reflect the ratings on certain bonds insured by
AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30, 2008. During the period covered
by this report, at least one rating agency reduced the rating for AMBAC-insured
and MBIA-insured bonds to AA and at least one rating agency further reduced the
ratings for FGIC-insured and XLCA-insured bonds to BB. Subsequent to April 30,
2008, and at the time this report was prepared, at least one rating agency
further reduced the rating for CIFG-insured bonds to BB and MBIA-insured bonds
to A. As of April 30, 2008, at least one rating agency has placed XLCA-insured
bonds on "negative credit watch" and one or more rating agencies have placed
each of these insurers on "negative outlook", which may presage one or more
rating reductions for such insurer or insurers in the future. If one or more
insurers' ratings are reduced by these rating agencies, it would likely reduce
the effective rating of many of the bonds insured by that insurer or insurers.
It is important to note that municipal bonds historically have had a very low
rate of default.

During March 2008, the Nuveen Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved
changes to the investment policies of all of the Nuveen insured municipal
closed-end funds. The new policies require that (1) at least 80% of a Fund's net
assets must be invested in insured municipal bonds guaranteed by insurers rated
"A" or better by at least one rating agency at the time of purchase; (2) at
least 80% of a Fund's net assets must be invested in municipal bonds rated "AA"
or better by at least one rating agency (with or without insurance), deemed to

securities at the time of purchase; and (3) up to 20% of a Fund's net assets may
be invested in uninsured municipal bonds rated "A" to "BBB" by at least one
rating agency or deemed to be of comparable quality by the Adviser at the time
of purchase. These policy changes are designed to increase portfolio manager
flexibility and retain the insured nature of the Funds' investment portfolios
for current and future environments. Some Funds may require shareholder approval
prior to implementing these policy changes.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AUCTION RATE PREFERRED MARKETS

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the preferred shares issued by these Funds than there
were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear" and that
many or all auction preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their shares in
these auctions were unable to do so. This decline in liquidity in auction
preferred shares did not lower the credit quality of these shares, and auction
preferred shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the
"maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with
the pre-established terms of the auction preferred shares. At the time this
report was prepared, the Funds' managers could not predict when future auctions
might succeed in attracting sufficient buyers for the shares offered, if ever.
The Funds' managers are working diligently to refund the auction preferred
shares, and have made progress in these efforts, but at present there is no
assurance that these efforts will succeed. These developments generally do not
affect the management or investment policies of these Funds. However, one
implication of these auction failures for common shareholders is that the Funds'
cost of leverage will likely be higher, at least temporarily, than it otherwise
would have been had the auctions continued to be successful. As a result, the
Funds' future common share earnings may be lower than they otherwise would have
been.

As previously noted, all of the Funds in this report use leverage to potentially
enhance opportunities for additional income for common shareholders. This
strategy continued to provide support for the Funds' income streams during this
turbulent period. As a result, the dividends of all six Funds remained stable
throughout the six-month reporting period ended April 30, 2008.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of NIO received a long-term capital gains distribution of $0.0019 per share at
the end of December 2007.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's common share NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid
dividends in excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that
is likewise reflected in the Fund's common share NAV. Each Fund will, over time,
pay all of its net investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April
30, 2008, all of the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances, based upon
our best estimate, for tax purposes and negative UNII balances for financial
statement purposes.

As of April 30, 2008, the Funds' common share prices were trading at discounts
to their common share NAVs as shown in the accompanying chart:

(1)   The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
      certain bonds insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30,
      2008. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)   The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
      certain bonds insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30,
      2008. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(3)   The Fund paid shareholders a capital gains distribution in December 2007
      of $0.0019 per share.

(1)   The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
      certain bonds insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30,
      2008. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)   The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
      certain bonds insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30,
      2008. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)   The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
      certain bonds insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30,
      2008. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                                                                           -----

       As of April 30, 2008,  all of the bonds in the Portfolio of  Investments,
       excluding temporary investments in short-term municipal  securities,  are
       either covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
       Portfolio  Insurance,  or are  backed by an  escrow  or trust  containing
       sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.  Government agency securities,  any of
       which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

  (1)  All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of Investments  are based on net
       assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2)  Optional  Call  Provisions:  Dates  (month  and year)  and  prices of the
       earliest optional call or redemption.  There may be other call provisions
       at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed  securities may
       be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3)  Ratings:  Using the  higher  of  Standard  & Poor's  Group  ("Standard  &
       Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's") rating.  Ratings
       below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's  are  considered  to be
       below investment grade.

       The  Portfolio of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain  bonds
       insured by AMBAC,  CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30, 2008. Please
       see the Portfolio Manager's  Commentary for an expanded discussion of the
       affect on the Fund of  changes to the  ratings  of  certain  bonds in the
       portfolio  resulting  from  changes  to the  ratings  of  the  underlying
       insurers both during the period and after period end.

  (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust  containing  sufficient  U.S.  Government or
       U.S.  Government  agency  securities  which ensure the timely  payment of
       principal and interest.  Such  investments are normally  considered to be
       equivalent to AAA rated securities.

  (5)  Investment  has a maturity of more than one year,  but has variable  rate
       and demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
       disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
       changes  periodically  based on market  conditions or a specified  market
       index.

  (6)  Preferred   Shares,  at  Liquidation  Value  as  a  percentage  of  total
       investments is (34.8)%.

(ETM)  Escrowed to maturity.

 (IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

 (UB)  Underlying  bond  of  an  inverse  floating  rate  trust  reflected  as a
       financing transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

      As of April 30, 2008, all of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments,
      excluding temporary investments in short-term municipal securities, are
      either covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
      Portfolio Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing
      sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, any of
      which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

      The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
      insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30, 2008. Please
      see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded discussion of the
      affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain bonds in the
      portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the underlying insurers
      both during the period and after period end.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
      changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified market
      index.

(6)   Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a percentage of total
      investments is (35.7)%.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

</TABLE>

       As of April 30, 2008,  all of the bonds in the Portfolio of  Investments,
       excluding temporary investments in short-term municipal  securities,  are
       either covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
       Portfolio  Insurance,  or are  backed by an  escrow  or trust  containing
       sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.  Government agency securities,  any of
       which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

  (1)  All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of Investments  are based on net
       assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2)  Optional  Call  Provisions:  Dates  (month  and year)  and  prices of the
       earliest optional call or redemption.  There may be other call provisions
       at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed  securities may
       be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3)  Ratings:  Using the  higher  of  Standard  & Poor's  Group  ("Standard  &
       Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's") rating.  Ratings
       below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's  are  considered  to be
       below investment grade.

       The  Portfolio of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain  bonds
       insured by AMBAC,  CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30, 2008. Please
       see the Portfolio Manager's  Commentary for an expanded discussion of the
       affect on the Fund of  changes to the  ratings  of  certain  bonds in the
       portfolio  resulting  from  changes  to the  ratings  of  the  underlying
       insurers both during the period and after period end.

  (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust  containing  sufficient  U.S.  Government or
       U.S.  Government  agency  securities  which ensure the timely  payment of
       principal and interest.  Such  investments are normally  considered to be
       equivalent to AAA rated securities.

  (5)  Investment  has a maturity of more than one year,  but has variable  rate
       and demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
       disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
       changes  periodically  based on market  conditions or a specified  market
       index.

  (6)  Preferred   Shares,  at  Liquidation  Value  as  a  percentage  of  total
       investments is (32.6)%.

(ETM)  Escrowed to maturity.

 (IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

 (UB)  Underlying  bond  of  an  inverse  floating  rate  trust  reflected  as a
       financing transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

</TABLE>

      As of April 30, 2008, at least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net
      assets  attributable  to  Preferred  shares)  are  invested  in  municipal
      securities that are either covered by Original Issue Insurance,  Secondary
      Market  Insurance or Portfolio  Insurance which ensures the timely payment
      of principal and interest.  Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets  (including
      net assets  attributable to Preferred shares) may be invested in municipal
      securities  that are (i)  either  backed by an escrow or trust  containing
      sufficient U.S.  Government or U.S.  Government  agency  securities  (also
      ensuring the timely payment of principal and interest),  or (ii) rated, at
      the time of  investment,  within the four  highest  grades  (Baa or BBB or
      better by Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch) or unrated but judged to be
      of comparable quality by the Adviser.

 (1)  All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of  Investments  are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

 (2)  Optional  Call  Provisions:  Dates  (month  and  year)  and  prices of the
      earliest  optional call or redemption.  There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain  mortgage-backed  securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

 (3)  Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below  investment
      grade.

      The  Portfolio  of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain  bonds
      insured by AMBAC,  CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30, 2008.  Please
      see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary for an expanded discussion of the
      affect on the Fund of  changes  to the  ratings  of  certain  bonds in the
      portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the underlying insurers
      both during the period and after period end.

 (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government  agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

 (5)  Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand  features  which  qualify it as a short-term  investment.  The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period.  This rate
      changes  periodically  based on market  conditions  or a specified  market
      index.

 (6)  Preferred   Shares,   at  Liquidation  Value  as  a  percentage  of  total
      investments is (33.4)%.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

</TABLE>

        As of April 30, 2008,  at least 80% of the Fund's net assets  (including
        net assets  attributable to Preferred  shares) are invested in municipal
        securities  that  are  either  covered  by  Original  Issue   Insurance,
        Secondary  Market  Insurance or Portfolio  Insurance  which  ensures the
        timely  payment of principal and  interest.  Up to 20% of the Fund's net
        assets  (including net assets  attributable to Preferred  shares) may be
        invested in municipal securities that are (i) either backed by an escrow
        or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
        securities (also ensuring the timely payment of principal and interest),
        or (ii) rated, at the time of investment, within the four highest grades
        (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch) or unrated
        but judged to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

  (1)   All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
        assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2)   Optional  Call  Provisions:  Dates  (month  and year) and  prices of the
        earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
        at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
        be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3)   Ratings:  Using the  higher of  Standard  & Poor's  Group  ("Standard  &
        Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc. ("Moody's") rating.  Ratings
        below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are  considered  to be
        below  investment  grade.

        The  Portfolio of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
        insured by AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA and XLCA as of April 30, 2008. Please
        see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded discussion of the
        affect on the Fund of  changes to the  ratings  of certain  bonds in the
        portfolio  resulting  from  changes  to the  ratings  of the  underlying
        insurers both during the period and after period end.

  (4)   Backed by an escrow or trust  containing  sufficient U.S.  Government or
        U.S.  Government  agency  securities  which ensure the timely payment of
        principal and interest.  Such investments are normally  considered to be
        equivalent to AAA rated securities.

  (5)   Preferred  Shares,  at  Liquidation  Value  as  a  percentage  of  total
        investments is (34.6)%.

(ETM)   Escrowed to maturity.

 (IF)   Inverse floating rate investment.

 (UB)   Underlying  bond  of an  inverse  floating  rate  trust  reflected  as a
        financing  transaction  pursuant to the  provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

1. General Information and Significant Accounting Policies

The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc. (NQI), Nuveen
Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal
Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2 (NPX),
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG) and Nuveen Insured
Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA) (collectively, the "Funds"). Common
shares of Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured
Income (NIF) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured
Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds
are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as
closed-end, diversified management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service may establish fair value based on
yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for a municipal bond or forward swap
contract, each Fund may use market quotes provided by major broker/dealers in
such investments. If it is determined that the market price for an investment or
derivative instrument is unavailable or inappropriate, the Board of
Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish fair value in
accordance with procedures established in good faith by the Board of
Directors/Trustees. Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate
and demand features qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2008, there were
no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Interest income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any. Dividend income,
if any, is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from

- -----

- -----

<PAGE>

regular federal and applicable state income taxes, if any, and in the case of
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum tax applicable to
individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders
of the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid
by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

Effective April 30, 2008, the Funds adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN
48). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the affirmative evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in the course of preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether it
is "more-likely-than-not" (i.e., a greater than 50-percent likelihood) of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold may result in a tax benefit or expense in the
current year.

Implementation of FIN 48 required management of the Funds to analyze all open
tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major
jurisdictions, which includes federal and certain states. Open tax years are
those that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the
last four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). The Funds have
no examinations in progress.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions through the end of the
reporting period, management of the Funds has reviewed all tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in the preparation of the Funds' tax returns and
concluded the adoption of FIN 48 resulted in no impact to the Funds' net assets
or results of operations as of and during the six months ended April 30, 2008.

The Funds are also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably
possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
change in the next twelve months.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the Preferred shares issued by the Funds than there were
offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear," and that many
Preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their shares in these auctions were
unable to do so. Preferred shareholders unable to sell their shares received
distributions at the "maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated
in accordance with the pre-established terms of the Preferred shares.

                                                                           -----

| Notes to
| FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited)

These developments generally do not affect the management or investment policies
of the Funds. However, one implication of these auction failures for Common
shareholders is that the Funds' cost of leverage will likely be higher, at least
temporarily, than it otherwise would have been had the auctions continued to be
successful. As a result, the Funds' future Common share earnings may be lower
than they otherwise would have been.

Insurance

During the six months ended April 30, 2008, Insured Quality (NQI), Insured
Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF) and Insured Premium Income 2
(NPX) invested primarily in municipal securities which are either covered by
insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account containing sufficient U.S.
Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both of which ensure the timely
payment of principal and interest.

During the six months ended April 30, 2008, Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) primarily invested at least 80% of their net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares) in municipal
securities that were covered by insurance. Each Fund may have also invested up
to 20% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an escrow or trust
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, or
(ii) rated, at the time of investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or
BBB or better by Moody's, Standard & Poor's or unrated but judged to be of
comparable quality by Nuveen Asset Management ("the Adviser"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").

On March 20, 2008, the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees authorized the
adoption of certain changes to each Fund's investment policies. Such changes
mandate that under normal circumstances, each Fund must invest at least 80% of
its net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares) in
municipal securities which are either covered by insurance or backed by an
escrow or trust account containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government
agency securities, both of which ensure the timely payment of principal and
interest. For purposes of this 80% test, insurers must have a claims paying
ability rated at least "A" at the time of purchase. In addition, each Fund must
invest at least 80% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities that are rated at least "AA" at the
time of purchase. Each Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets
(including net assets attributable to Preferred shares) in municipal securities
rated below "AA" (based on the higher rating of the insurer, if any, or the
underlying bond) or are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the
Adviser.

Effective March 20, 2008, the foregoing policy changes were implemented in
Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA).

Effective March 20, 2008, Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO) and
Premier Insured Income (NIF) may invest in insured municipal bonds with an
insurer rated at least "A" at the time of purchase. The remaining foregoing
changes will be implemented pending shareholder approval.

The foregoing policy changes will be implemented in Insured Premium Income 2
(NPX) pending shareholder approval.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Inverse Floating Rate Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying
bond but also on the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates,
and because the inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of
loss of the greater face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). A Fund may also enter into shortfall and
forbearance agreements (sometimes referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit
recovery swap") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund agrees to reimburse the
broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the difference between the
liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the trust and the liquidation
value of the floating rate certificates, as well as any shortfalls in interest
cash flows. The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the Fund the right (a) to
cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to tender their notes at
par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate bond held by the trust
to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment in an
externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as an "Inverse floating rate investment". An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater, recourse trust or credit recovery swap is
accounted for as a financing transaction in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities". In such
instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited into a special purpose trust is
identified in the Portfolio of Investments as an "Underlying bond of an inverse
floating rate trust", with the Fund accounting for the short-term floating rate
certificates issued by the trust as "Floating rate obligations" on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the Fund reflects in Investment Income
the entire earnings of the underlying bond and accounts for the related interest
paid to the holders of the short-term floating rate certificates as "Interest
expense on floating rate obligations" in the Statement of Operations.

During the six months ended April 30, 2008, each Fund invested in externally
deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

The average floating rate obligations outstanding and average annual interest
rate and fees related to self-deposited inverse floaters during the six months
ended April 30, 2008, were as follows:

Forward Swap Transactions

Each Fund is authorized to invest in forward interest rate swap transactions.
Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve
each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or
variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve
the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather
is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to
terminate its forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to
the credit risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment
to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon termination. To reduce such credit
risk, all counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the
daily valuation of

                                                                           -----

each swap) on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount
of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when any
of the Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have
instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a
value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss above a
pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently
adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate, either up or down, by at
least the predetermined threshold amount. Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) was the
only Fund to invest in forward interest rate swap transactions during the six
months ended April 30, 2008.

Zero Coupon Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the Portfolios of Investments
with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description. The market prices of zero coupon
securities generally are more volatile than the market prices of securities that
pay interest periodically.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. Income Tax Information

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
transactions subject to SFAS No. 140. To the extent that differences arise that
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented in the annual
report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not
require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the
net asset values of the Funds.

At April 30, 2008, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. Management Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the
Adviser, and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets
within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund
shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as
well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
of each Fund as follows:

| Notes to
| FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited)

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and
expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

6. New Accounting Pronouncements

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This
standard establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a
framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already
required or permitted by existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The changes to current generally
accepted accounting principles from the application of this standard relate to
the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the
expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. As of April 30, 2008,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional disclosures may be required
about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of
the measurements included within the Statement of Operations for the period.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 161

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard is intended to enhance
financial statement disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and enable investors to understand: a) how and why a fund uses
derivative instruments, b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
are accounted for, and c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
affect a fund's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS
No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. As of April 30, 2008,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional footnote disclosures may be
required about the use of derivative instruments and hedging items.

Auction Rate Preferred Shares (ARPS)

On June 11, 2008, Nuveen announced the Fund Board's approval of plans to use
tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as inverse floating rate securities or
inverse floaters, to refinance a portion of the funds' outstanding ARPS, whose
auctions have been failing for several months, including an initial phase of
approximately $1 billion in forty-one funds. Of this amount, Nuveen expects that
approximately $560 million in ARPS redemption notices will be issued shortly for
thirteen funds, including Insured Opportunity (NIO).

Recent Credit Market Events

Subsequent to April 30, 2008, and at the time this report was prepared, at least
one rating agency further reduced the rating for CIFG-insured bonds to BB and
MBIA-insured bonds to A.

*      Distributions from Capital Gains to Preferred shareholders rounds to less
       than $.01 per share.

**     Distributions from Capital Gains to Common shareholders rounds to less
       than $.01 per share.

***    Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
       price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
       reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
       per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
       period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the
       following month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price.
       The actual reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may
       take place over several days, and in some instances may not be based on
       the market price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from
       the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

       Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
       changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at
       net asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset
       value, if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is
       typically paid on the first business day of the following month, is
       assumed to be reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual
       reinvest price for the last dividend declared in the period may often be
       based on the Fund's market price (and not its net asset value), and
       therefore may be different from the price used in calculation. Total
       returns are not annualized.

****   After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

*****  During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and
       Insured Opportunity (NIO) received payments from the Adviser of $27,762
       and $42,338, respectively, to offset losses realized on the disposal of
       investments purchased in violation of each Fund's investment
       restrictions. This reimbursement did not have an impact on the Funds'
       Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value.

****** Annualized.

+      The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++     Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
       shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
       to Preferred shares.

(a)    Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
       inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
       described in Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

(b)    For the six months ended April 30, 2008.

*    Total  Return on Market Value is the  combination  of changes in the market
     price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and reinvested
     capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid per share at
     the time of reinvestment.  The last dividend declared in the period,  which
     is typically  paid on the first  business day of the  following  month,  is
     assumed  to  be  reinvested   at  the  ending  market  price.   The  actual
     reinvestment  for the last  dividend  declared in the period may take place
     over several  days,  and in some  instances  may not be based on the market
     price,  so the actual  reinvestment  price may be different  from the price
     used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

     Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value is the  combination of changes
     in Common share net asset value,  reinvested  dividend  income at net asset
     value and reinvested  capital gains  distributions  at net asset value,  if
     any. The last dividend  declared in the period,  which is typically paid on
     the first business day of the following  month, is assumed to be reinvested
     at the  ending net asset  value.  The  actual  reinvest  price for the last
     dividend  declared  in the period  may often be based on the Fund's  market
     price (and not its net asset value),  and  therefore may be different  from
     the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**   After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***  Annualized.

+    The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++   Ratios  do not  reflect  the  effect  of  dividend  payments  to  Preferred
     shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable to
     Preferred shares.

(a)  Interest  expense  arises from the  application  of SFAS No. 140 to certain
     inverse floating rate  transactions  entered into by the Fund as more fully
     described in Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

(b)  For the six months ended April 30, 2008.

*     Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of changes
      in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net asset
      value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value, if
      any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid on
      the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be reinvested
      at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the last
      dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's market
      price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different from
      the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***   Annualized.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares.

(a)   Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
      inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

(b)   For the period November 21, 2002 (commencement of operations) through
      October 31, 2003.

Reinvest Automatically
   EASILY and CONVENIENTLY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nuveen makes reinvesting easy. A phone call is all it takes to set up your
reinvestment account.

Nuveen Closed-End Funds Dividend Reinvestment Plan

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

Easy and convenient

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

How shares are purchased

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per share may exceed
the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the acquisition of fewer
shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by
the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage commissions on open
market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These commissions usually
will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

Flexible

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of
TERMS USED in this REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o     Auction Rate Bond: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
      payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
      process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
      Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
      sale are deemed to have "failed", with current holders receiving a
      formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

o     Average Annual Total Return: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     Average Effective Maturity: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     Inverse Floaters: Inverse floating rate securities are created by
      depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed interest rate, into a
      special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a)
      issues floating rate certificates typically paying short-term tax-exempt
      interest rates to third parties in amounts equal to some fraction of the
      deposited bond's par amount or market value, and (b) issues an inverse
      floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater")
      to an investor (such as a Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure
      to a long-term municipal bond. The income received by the holder of the
      inverse floater varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the
      floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the holder
      of the inverse floater bears substantially all of the underlying bond's
      downside investment risk. The holder of the inverse floater typically also
      benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
      underlying bond's value. Hence, an inverse floater essentially represents
      an investment in the underlying bond on a leveraged basis.

o     Leverage-Adjusted Duration: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     Market Yield (also known as Dividend Yield or Current Yield): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     Net Asset Value (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated
      by subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any Preferred shares
      issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then
      dividing the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are
      calculated at the end of each business day.

o     Taxable-Equivalent Yield: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     Zero Coupon Bond: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.

Advantage Municipal Fund;

     2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

     4. The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     (d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
