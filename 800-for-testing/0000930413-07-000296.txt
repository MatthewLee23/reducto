CHAIRMAN'S REPORT (UNAUDITED)

   At November 30, 2006 the Company's net asset value was $74.19 per share.  The
closing price of the Company's  shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $64.21
at November 30, 2006, which represented a 13.5% discount to the net asset value.
This compares with the net asset value of $55.93 per share at November 30, 2005,
at which time the closing price was $49.65, a discount of 11.2% to the net asset
value.

   Net  investment  income for the fiscal year ended  November 30, 2006 was $.76
per share,  as compared to $.10 per share for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2005. Realized gain from investments, including net realized gain on investments
from foreign currency  transactions for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006,
were $1.38 per share,  as  compared to $1.25 per share for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2005.

   Dividends  totaling  $.90 per share were paid or declared  during each of the
fiscal years ended  November  30, 2006 and  November  30,  2005.  (See Note 1.E.
Dividends  to  Shareholders  (page 10) and  Certain tax  information  for United
States  shareholders  (pages 13 and 14) for further  comments.)

THE GOLD BULLION MARKET

   In 2006 the dollar  price of gold  continued to improve and in May it reached
$732/oz.  In 1980 the price spiked to $800/oz.  Unlike that occasion,  this time
the gold price  appears to be much less  inclined to collapse  from recent highs
and it has spent a good deal of time above $600/oz.  Indeed, the average for the
year should be around  $603/oz,  which is a very gratifying 35% higher than last
year's average price.

   The  rand/dollar  exchange rate is, of course,  critical to the well-being of
the South  African  mines  and like most  exporters  they  welcome a weak  rand.
Although there has been some recent recovery as the dollar has itself  weakened,
the rand was much  softer in 2006  than in 2005  resulting  in record  high rand
prices for bullion. A peak in the South African gold price of almost R154,350/kg
was seen in July and the year's  average price is almost  R132,000/kg.  The last
few  months  have seen the rand price  staying  quite  close to the  R145,000/kg
level.

   AngloGold  Ashanti has reported on an  interesting  development  in the North
American  market.  The retail  trade  there  appears  resigned to the higher raw
material  prices  and,  accordingly,  has been  increasing  prices  on  finished
products rather than trying to keep prices constant by reducing the gold content
of jewelry pieces. U.S. consumers have been setting records in their spending on
these items.

   Without any  particularly  noteworthy  activity in the bullion  market by the
world's central banks this year, analysts have been speculating about whether or
not  Russia  might  not soon be a  significant  buyer in order to boost the gold
component of its reserves from currently quite low levels.  China's intention to
diversify its own reserves away from dollar currency  holdings has also at times
been a factor in the gold bullion market.

THE GOLD SHARE MARKET

   The FTSE/JSE Gold Mining Index has just six  constituent  shares of which the
three owned by the Company make an overwhelming majority contribution. The index
echoed the rand gold price and peaked at 3333  points in July 2006 as well.  The
range this year has been a  comparatively  modest 880 points  (2005's  range was
1720  points).  Currently,  the index level is at about 2900 points.  One factor
holding back share price  performance is that both AngloGold Ashanti and Harmony
have been unable to report headline  profits for any of the quarterly  reporting
periods so far this year. In both cases a key culprit is poorly positioned hedge
books.

   Gold Fields is the largest holding in our portfolio. It is the second largest
gold  producer  in  Africa.  The  company  is  approaching   completion  of  the
acquisition  of the South Deep Mine  (formerly  jointly owned by South  Africa's
Western Areas and Canada's Barrick Gold) for $1.5 billion in shares and cash. In
2007,  Gold Fields plans to complete a study into the viability of expanding the
mine's annual  production to 1 million ounces from the 800,000 ounces  currently
expected by 2011.  South Deep Mine is one of the most  important  new sources of
gold  reserves in the world and it will be an advantage to Gold Fields at a time
when all gold  mining  companies  are  seeking  new  reserves to replace the old
reserves currently being mined.

   The  performance  of  the  North  American  producers,  as  measured  by  the
Philadelphia  Gold & Silver Index, has been similar to the dollar gold price and
peaked at just over 160 in May.  This  represented  a 100% gain over the low set
nearly  one year  earlier.  The  current  level of 140 is nearly  at the  year's
average.

THE PLATINUM MARKET

   Rumors about the possible  launch of a platinum  metal  exchange-traded  fund
(ETF)  caused the price of this metal to spike to an all time high of  $1,390/oz
in the middle of November 2006. However, it quickly retreated from these heights
and is currently in the lower end of the $1,100/oz to $l,250/oz range,  where it
has been for much of the year. This still represents a substantial increase over
2005 prices. According to the Johnson Matthey Platinum review, industrial demand
for the metal  should grow while  jewelry  demand -  particularly  in China - is
expected to decline.  With  overall  supply  growth more or less  matching  this
forecast demand,  the expectation is for the platinum price to remain at current
levels within a $280/oz trading range.

   Both Anglo  American  Platinum  and Impala  share  prices have enjoyed a very
positive  year and, as they did in 2005,  will end the  current  year near their
all-time highs.

THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

   The United States ceased its regular  upward  ratcheting of the federal funds
rate in mid-2006 and the world has been watching to see how the U.S. economy and
its currency will respond. There are well-defended and strongly argued positions
on either side of the soft landing  versus hard landing  scenarios as well as on
whether  or not the  U.S.  dollar  will  weaken  further.  Increasingly,  recent
evidence is growing that the housing  market is slowing  substantially,  but any
signs of a knock-on effect for the all-important consumer are not yet obvious.

<PAGE>

   Globally,  there seems only a scant threat of  inflation  soaring away on the
upside; nevertheless,  many central banks have been continuing a program of rate
increases.  In South Africa, the Reserve Bank has become particularly worried by
the surge in money supply and credit extension.  In addition to enjoying its own
share of the world-wide increase in liquidity,  South Africa has been subject to
a unique change in the population dynamics, as hitherto  underemployed  portions
of the community  have been able to join in the consumer  culture and are making
up for lost time.  In June,  after a long period of no change,  the Bank began a
program of increasing  the  repurchase  rates about every two months by 50 basis
points.  It is currently now at 9% and the prime  overdraft rate is at 12.5%. It
will take a while  for even  these  comparatively  high  interest  rates to slow
consumer momentum.

   As noted  earlier,  the rand has not enjoyed a strong year.  Against the U.S.
dollar its weakness was somewhat  watered down by its own weakness against other
currencies  and so at a current  level of just over R7 per USD it is down  about
10% since January 1, 2006. Against the British pound,  however,  it is down more
than 20% for the comparable  period.  Some impact of this weakening currency can
be seen in the  annualized  GDP growth  figures  of 5.5%,  5.0% and 4.9% for the
first  three  quarters  of 2006,  respectively.  The recent  substantial  upward
revision to the first two of these  figures shows that the country came close to
the government  target of 6% but the trend is,  unfortunately,  not in the right
direction.

PORTFOLIO MATTERS

   In July 2005,  the  Company's  shareholders  voted to change the  fundamental
investment  policies  of the  Company  in  order  to  allow  it to  broaden  the
diversification  of its portfolio  outside of South Africa.  The purpose of this
change was to allow the Company to take  advantage of  investment  opportunities
arising in countries around the world.

   South Africa's share of world production has dropped from  approximately  80%
thirty years ago to less than 15% today.  South Africa is still in possession of
immense gold reserves. However, most of these reserves can only be produced at a
cost too high to encourage production at the current gold price. It is essential
that gold mining companies seek out new mineable  reserves  throughout the world
to replace  current  production.  To that end, South African gold miners have to
some extent expanded their exploration and production  activities outside of the
country.  However,  if the Company intends to fully  participate in the benefits
from this expansion in the gold mining  industry,  it should be diversifying its
portfolio out of the South African  investments that have served it so well over
the years. This diversification  should and will take a broad geographic form as
many,  if not most,  of the most rapidly  developing  mining  endeavours  are in
countries where political risk is an ongoing concern.

   AS WE CONTINUE TO  DIVERSIFY  THE  PORTFOLIO,  IT IS LIKELY THAT MORE CAPITAL
GAINS  WILL BE  REALIZED  THAN  WAS  TYPICAL  IN  PAST  YEARS.  AS THIS  OCCURS,
SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR ADVISORS ARE AGAIN ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW THE IMPACT OF THE
U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RULES GENERALLY DESCRIBED ON PAGES 13 AND 14 OF THE 2006
ANNUAL  REPORT,  AND IN  PREVIOUS  ANNUAL  AND  SEMI-ANNUAL  REPORTS,  ON  THEIR
INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL AND TAX SITUATION.

predecessor, ASA Limited, the latter of which he served as Managing Director for
many years.

   THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE HELD ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY
8, 2007, AT 10:00 A.M. AT THE OFFICES OF UBS, 1285 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS,  14TH

CERTAIN INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS (UNAUDITED)

The following is a summary of certain of the Company's  investment  policies and
restrictions  and is  subject  to the  more  complete  statements  contained  in
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

THE  CONCENTRATION  OF  INVESTMENTS  IN  A  PARTICULAR   INDUSTRY  OR  GROUP  OF
INDUSTRIES.  It is a fundamental policy (i.e., a policy that may be changed only
by shareholder vote) of the Company that at least 80% of its total assets be (i)
invested  in common  shares or  securities  convertible  into  common  shares of
companies  engaged,  directly  or  indirectly,  in the  exploration,  mining  or
processing of gold, silver, platinum,  diamonds or other precious minerals, (ii)
held as  bullion  or  other  direct  forms of gold,  silver,  platinum  or other
precious minerals, (iii) invested in instruments representing interests in gold,
silver,  platinum or other  precious  minerals such as  certificates  of deposit
therefor, and/or (iv) invested in securities of investment companies,  including
exchange  traded  funds,  or other  securities  that seek to replicate the price
movement of gold,  silver or platinum  bullion.  Compliance  with the percentage
limitation  relating to the  concentration of the Company's  investments will be
measured at the time of investment.

If  investment  opportunities  deemed by the  Company to be  attractive  are not
available in the types of securities referred to in the preceding paragraph, the
Company may deviate from the  investment  policy  outlined in that paragraph and
make temporary investments of unlimited amounts in securities issued by the U.S.
Government, its agencies or instrumentalities or other high quality money market
instruments.

THE  PERCENTAGE  OF VOTING  SECURITIES  OF ANY ONE ISSUER  THAT THE  COMPANY MAY
ACQUIRE. It is the non-fundamental policy (i.e., a policy that may be changed by
the Board of  Directors)  of the Company  that the Company  shall not purchase a
security  if, at the time of  purchase,  more than 20% of the value of its total
assets would be invested in securities of the issuer of such security.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
ASA (Bermuda) Limited:

   We have audited the  accompanying  statement of assets and liabilities of ASA
(Bermuda) Limited (the "Company"),  including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2006,  and the related  statement of operations  and  supplementary
information for the year then ended,  the statement of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then  ended.  These  financial  statements,
supplementary information and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements,  supplementary  information and financial highlights based
on our audits.

   We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements,  supplementary  information and financial  highlights are
free of  material  misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an audit of the
Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  audits  included
consideration  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis for
designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial   statements,   supplementary
information and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting principles used
and  significant  estimates  made  by  management  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
securities owned as of November 30, 2006 by  correspondence  with the custodian.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion,  the  financial  statements,  supplementary  information  and
financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial  position of ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited at November  30,  2006,  the
results of its operations and supplementary information for the year then ended,
the  changes  in its net  assets  for each of the two years in the  period  then
ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended November 30, 2006


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESAS  A (Bermuda) Limited ("Company")
is a closed-end management investment company registered under the United States
Investment Company Act of 1940 and is organized as an exempted limited liability
company  under the laws of Bermuda.  The following is a summary of the Company's
significant accounting policies:

A. INVESTMENTS

Portfolio  securities  listed on U.S. and foreign stock  exchanges are generally
valued at the last  reported  sales price on the last trading day of the period,
or the mean  between the closing bid and asked  prices of those  securities  not
traded on that date.  If a mean price  cannot be computed  due to the absence of
either a bid or an asked  price,  then the bid price plus 1% or the asked  price
less 1%, as applicable,  is used.  Securities  listed on foreign stock exchanges
may be fair valued based on significant events that have occurred  subsequent to
the close of the foreign markets.

Securities  for which current market  quotations  are not readily  available are
valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by, or in accordance with
procedures adopted by, the Company's Board of Directors. If a security is valued
at a "fair  value",  that value is likely to be  different  from the last quoted
price for the security.  Various factors may be reviewed in order to make a good
faith  determination of a security's fair value. These factors include,  but are
not  limited  to, the nature of the  security;  relevant  financial  or business
developments  of the  issuer;  actively  traded  similar or related  securities;
conversion rights on the security; and changes in overall market conditions.

Where the Company holds  securities  listed on foreign stock  exchanges and ADRs
representing these securities are actively traded on the NewYork Stock Exchange,
the  securities  are fair valued based on the last  reported  sales price of the
ADRs.

The  difference  between cost and current  value is reflected  separately as net
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.  The net realized gain or
loss from the sale of securities is determined  for  accounting  purposes on the
identified cost basis.

There is no assurance that the valuation at which the Company's  investments are
carried could be realized upon sale.

B. CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company  considers  all money market and all highly  liquid  temporary  cash
investments  purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be
cash equivalents.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio  securities  and other assets and  liabilities  denominated in foreign
currencies  are  translated  into U.S.  dollar  amounts at the  closing  rate of
exchange on the date of valuation.  Purchases and sales of investment securities
and income and expense items  denominated  in foreign  currencies are translated
into U.S.  dollar  amounts on the  respective  dates of such  transactions.  The
resulting  net foreign  currency  gain or loss is included in the  statement  of
operations.

D. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

During the year  ended  November  30,  2006,  sales of  securities  amounted  to
$33,773,417 and purchases of securities amounted to $30,827,580.

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend  date, net of withholding  taxes,
if any. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

E. DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

The  reporting  for  financial  statement  purposes of  dividends  paid from net
investment income or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate reporting
for United  States  federal  income tax  purposes.  The  differences  are caused
primarily by the separate line item reporting for financial  statement  purposes
of foreign exchange gains or losses.  See pages 13 and 14 for certain additional
tax information for United States shareholders.

F. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.

G. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements are presented in United States dollars.

Certain prior year amounts in the  accompanying  financial  statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Year ended November 30, 2006


2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In  September 2006,  the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued  STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS NO.
157, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition
of fair value for  financial  reporting,  establishes  a framework for measuring
fair  value and  requires  additional  disclosures  about the use of fair  value
measurements.  FAS 157 is effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. As of November 30, 2006, the Company does not believe the adoption of FAS
157 will  impact the  amounts  reported in the  financial  statements,  however,
additional  disclosures  will be  required  about the inputs used to develop the
measurements  of fair  value  and the  effect  of  certain  of the  measurements
reported in the statement of operations for a fiscal period.

3. RETIREMENT PLANS  The Company has an unfunded non-qualified pension agreement
with its Chairman,  President  and  Treasurer,  Robert J. A. Irwin,  pursuant to
which the Company  credits  amounts to a pension  benefit  account as determined
from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Through the period ended  November
30, 2006, interest  equivalents were credited on amounts credited to the pension
benefit account at an annual rate of 3.5%.  Beginning December 1, 2006, interest
equivalents  will be credited  at an annual rate of 5%. The Company  recorded an
expense of $65,500 for the total amount  credited to the pension benefit account
during the year ended November 30, 2006.

   An amount equal to the balance in the pension benefit account will be payable
in a lump sum upon  termination  of Mr.  Irwin's  service  as an  officer of the
Company.  At November 30, 2006, the Company has recorded a liability for pension
benefits  due under the  agreement  of  $544,967.  The  Company  has  recorded a
deferred pension asset of $170,000 related to this retirement obligation.

   The  Company  recorded a provision  of $739,431  during the fiscal year ended
November  30,  2005  for  an  actuarially   determined  unfunded  liability  for
retirement  benefits  due to current and future  retired  directors.  During the
fiscal year ended  November  30,  2006,  the  liability  amount of $739,431  was
reduced  by  $46,772  due to the  death of a  retired  director  resulting  in a
liability of $692,659 as of November 30, 2006.  Directors of the Company qualify
to  receive  retirement  benefits  if they  have  served  the  Company  (and its
predecessor, ASA Limited) for at least twelve years prior to retirement.

4. ASA  LIMITED  In  connection  with the  winding up of ASA  Limited,  in South
Africa,  the  Company  incurred  expenses  of $55,029  for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2006. In addition, the Company made a severance payment of $500,673
to Ronald L. McCarthy,  former Managing Director of ASA Limited.  This amount is
reported as severance expense on the statement of operations.

5.  CONCENTRATION RISK  It is a fundamental  policy of the Company that at least
80% of its total assets be invested in securities of companies engaged, directly
or  indirectly,  in the  exploration,  mining  or  processing  of gold or  other
precious  minerals  and/or  in other  gold  and  precious  mineral  investments.
Asubstantial  portion of the  Company's  assets  currently  is invested in South
African companies and other companies having significant assets or operations in
SouthAfrica.  The Company is,  therefore,  subject to gold and precious  mineral
related risks as well as risks  related to investing in South Africa,  including
political,  economic,  regulatory,  currency  fluctuation  and foreign  exchange
risks. As a result of industry consolidation,  the Company currently is invested
in a limited  number of  securities  and thus holds large  positions  in certain
securities.  Because the Company's  investments  are  concentrated  in a limited
number of  securities  of  companies  involved  in the  mining of gold and other
precious minerals and related activities, the net asset value of the Company may
be  subject  to  greater  volatility  than  that of a more  broadly  diversified
investment company.

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
contracts  that contain a variety of  indemnifications.  The  Company's  maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Company has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification  provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.


                                                                              11

CERTAIN TAX INFORMATION FOR
UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)

   THE  FOLLOWING  IS OF A GENERAL  NATURE  ONLY AND IS NOT,  AND  SHOULD NOT BE
INTERPRETED AS, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR UNITED STATES  SHAREHOLDER
OF THE COMPANY.  DUE TO THE  COMPLEXITY  AND  POTENTIALLY  ADVERSE EFFECT OF THE
APPLICABLE TAX RULES,  UNITED STATES  SHAREHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT
THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS  CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF THESE RULES ON THEIR INVESTMENT
IN THE COMPANY AND ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS.

   Under  rules  enacted  by the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  the  Company  became a
"passive foreign investment  company" (a "PFIC") on December 1, 1987. The manner
in which these rules apply  depends on whether a United States  shareholder  (1)
elects to treat the Company as a qualified electing fund ("QEF") with respect to
his  Company  shares,  (2) for  taxable  years  of a United  States  shareholder
beginning after December 31, 1997, elects to "mark-to-market" his Company shares
as of the close of each taxable year, or (3) makes neither election.

   In general,  if a United  States  shareholder  of the  Company  does NOT make
either such election, any gain realized on the disposition of his Company shares
will be treated as ordinary  income.  In addition,  such a  shareholder  will be
subject to an  "interest  charge" on part of his tax  liability  with respect to
such  gain,  as well as with  respect to an  "excess  distribution"  made by the
Company (as explained in the following paragraph).  Furthermore,  shares held by
such a  shareholder  may be  denied  the  benefit  of any  otherwise  applicable
increase in tax basis at death.  Under  proposed  regulations,  a  "disposition"
would include a U.S. taxpayer's becoming a nonresident alien.

   As noted, the general tax consequences  described in the preceding  paragraph
apply to an "excess  distribution"  on Company  shares,  which is defined as the
total distributions by the Company a shareholder  receives during a taxable year
that are more  than 125% of the  average  amount  it  distributed  for the three
preceding taxable years.* If the Company makes an excess distribution in a year,
a United States  shareholder who has not made a QEF or  mark-to-market  election
would be required to allocate the excess amount  ratably over the ENTIRE holding
period for his shares.  That allocation would result in tax being payable at the
highest  applicable rate in the prior taxable years to which the distribution is
allocated and interest charges being imposed on the resulting  "underpayment" of
taxes made in those years.  In contrast,  a  distribution  that is not an excess
distribution  would  be  taxable  to a  United  States  shareholder  as a normal
dividend,** with no interest charge.

   If a United  States  shareholder  elects to treat the  Company  as a QEF with
respect to his  shares  therein  for his first  year he holds his shares  during
which the Company is a PFIC,  the rules  described in the  preceding  paragraphs
generally  would not apply;  those rules also would not apply to a United States
shareholder  who makes the QEF election after such first year and also elects to
treat his shares  generally  as if they were sold for their fair market value on
the  first  day of the  first  taxable  year of the  Company  for  which the QEF
election is effective,  in which event the gain from such "deemed sale" would be
treated  as  an  excess  distribution.   Instead,  the  electing  United  States
shareholder would include annually in his gross income his PRO RATA share of the
Company's   ordinary  earnings  and  net  capital  gain  (his  "QEF"  inclusion)
regardless  of whether  such income or gain was actually  distributed.  A United
States shareholder who makes a valid QEF election will recognize capital gain on
any profit  from the  actual  sale of his  shares if those  shares  were held as
capital assets.

   Alternatively,  if a  United  States  shareholder  makes  the  mark-to-market
election with respect to Company shares for taxable years  beginning on or after
January 1, 1998,  such  shareholder  would be  required  annually  to report any
unrealized  gain  with  respect  to his  shares  as  ordinary  income,  and  any
unrealized  loss would be permitted as an ordinary  loss, but only to the extent
of previous inclusions of ordinary income. Any gain subsequently  realized by an
electing United States shareholder on a sale or other disposition of his Company
shares also would be treated as ordinary income,  but such shareholder would not
be subject to an interest  charge on his resulting tax liability.  Special rules
apply to a United States  shareholder who held his PFIC stock prior to his first
taxable year for which the mark-to-market election was effective.

   A United States  shareholder with a valid QEF election in effect would not be
taxed  on any  distributions  paid  by the  Company  to the  extent  of any  QEF
inclusions,  but any  distributions  out of accumulated  earnings and profits in
excess thereof would be treated as taxable  dividends.  Such a shareholder would
increase the tax basis in his Company shares by the amount of any QEF inclusions
and reduce  such tax basis by any  distributions  to him that are not taxable as
described  in the  preceding  sentence.  Special  rules  apply to United  States
shareholders  who make the QEF  election and wish to defer the payment of tax on
their annual QEF inclusions.

   Each  shareholder  who desires QEF  treatment  must  individually  elect such
treatment. The QEF election must be made for the taxable year of the shareholder
in which or with which the  Company's  taxable  year  ends.  A QEF  election  is
effective for the shareholder's taxable year for which it is made and all of his
subsequent  taxable  years and may not be  revoked  without  the  consent of the
Internal  Revenue  Service.  A  shareholder  of the  Company  who first held his
Company shares after November 30, 2005 and who files his tax return on the basis
of a calendar year may make a QEF election on his 2006 tax return. A shareholder
of the Company who first held his Company shares on or before  November 30, 2005
may also make the QEF election on his 2006 tax return but should consult his tax
advisor  concerning the tax consequences and special rules that apply when a QEF
election could have been made with respect to such shares for an earlier taxable
year.

   A QEF election must be made by the due date, with extensions,  of the federal
income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is to apply. Under
Treasury  regulations,  a QEF election is made on Internal  Revenue Service Form
8621,  which must be completed  and attached to a timely filed income tax return
in which the shareholder reports his QEF inclusion for the taxable year to which
the election applies. In

- ------------------

* For  example,  the Company paid annual  dividends  of $.90,  $.55 and $.80 per
share during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,  an average per year of $.75 per
share.  Accordingly,  any  dividends  during  2006 in excess of $.9375 per share
(125% of $.75) would be treated as an excess  distribution  for that year.  (All
amounts in U.S.  currency.)

** Because the Company is a PFIC, dividends it pays will not qualify for the 15%
maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on dividends that  individuals  receive and
instead will be taxed at rates up to 35%.


                                                                              13
<PAGE>

order to allow United  States  shareholders  to make QEF elections and to comply
with the applicable annual reporting requirements, the Company annually provides
them a  "PFIC  Annual  Information  Statement"  containing  certain  information
required by Treasury regulations.

   In early 2007, the Company will send to United States  shareholders  the PFIC
Annual  Information  Statement for the Company's 2006 taxable year.  Such annual
information  statement  may be used for  purposes  of  completing  Form 8621.  A
shareholder  who either is subject  to a prior QEF  election  or is making a QEF
election for the first time must attach a completed  Form 8621 to his income tax
return each year.  Other United States  shareholders  also must attach completed
Forms 8621 to their tax returns  each year,  but  shareholders  not electing QEF
treatment will not need to report QEF inclusions thereon.

   Special rules apply to United States  persons who hold Company shares through
intermediate  entities or persons and to United States shareholders who directly
or indirectly pledge their shares, including those in a margin account.

   Ordinarily, the tax basis that is obtained by a transferee of property on the
property  owner's death is adjusted to the  property's  fair market value on the
date of death (or alternate valuation date). If a United States shareholder dies
owning  shares with respect to which he did not elect QEF  treatment (or elected
such  treatment  after the first  taxable year in which he owned shares in which
the Company was a PFIC and did not elect to recognize gain, as described above),
the  transferee  of those shares will not be entitled to adjust the tax basis in
such  shares  to their  fair  market  value on the date of death  (or  alternate
valuation  date).  In that case, in general,  the transferee of such shares will
take a basis in the shares equal to the shareholder's  basis therein immediately
before his death. If a United States  shareholder dies owning Company shares for
which  a  valid  QEF  election  was in  effect  for all  taxable  years  in such
shareholder's  holding  period  during  which  the  Company  was a PFIC  (or the
shareholder  made a "deemed sale election"),  then the basis increase  generally
will be available.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (UNAUDITED)


   Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") has been engaged to offer
a dividend  reinvestment  and stock purchase plan (the "Plan") to  shareholders.
Shareholders  may elect to participate in the Plan by signing an  authorization.
The  authorization  appoints  Computershare as agent to apply to the purchase of
common  shares of the Company in the open market (i) all cash  dividends  (after
deduction of the service  charge  described  below) that become  payable to such
participant on the Company's shares  (including  shares registered in his or her
name  and  shares  accumulated  under  the  Plan)  and (ii)  any  optional  cash
investments ($50 minimum, subject to an annual maximum of $60,000) received from
such participant.

   For the  purpose  of making  purchases,  Computershare  will  commingle  each
participant's  funds with those of all other participants in the Plan. The price
per  share of  shares  purchased  for each  participant's  account  shall be the
average price (including brokerage  commissions and any other costs of purchase)
of all shares  purchased in the open market with the net funds  available from a
cash dividend and any voluntary cash payments being concurrently  invested.  Any
stock  dividends or split shares  distributed on shares held in the Plan will be
credited to the participant's account.

   For each  participant,  a service charge of 5% of the combined  amount of the
participant's dividend and any voluntary payment being concurrently invested, up
to a maximum  charge  of $2.50 per  participant  plus  $.03 per  share,  will be
deducted  (and  paid  to  Computershare)  prior  to  each  purchase  of  shares.
Shareholder  sales of shares held by  Computershare in the Plan are subject to a
fee of $10.00  plus  $.12 per  share  deducted  from the  proceeds  of the sale.
Additional  nominal fees are charged by Computershare  for specific  shareholder
requests such as requests for  information  regarding share cost basis detail in
excess of two prior years and for replacement Forms 1099 older than three years.

   Participation  in the Plan may be terminated by a participant  at any time by
written  instructions to  Computershare.  Upon  termination,  a participant will
receive a  certificate  for the full  number of  shares  credited  to his or her
account, unless he or she requests the sale of all or part of such shares.

   Dividends  reinvested  by a  shareholder  under  the Plan will  generally  be
treated for U.S.  federal  income tax  purposes in the same manner as  dividends
paid to such shareholder in cash. See "Certain tax information for United States
shareholders"  for more information  regarding tax consequences of an investment
in shares of the  Company,  including  the effect of the  Company's  status as a
PFIC. The amount of the service charge is deductible for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, subject to limitations.

   To  participate  in the Plan,  shareholders  may not hold  their  shares in a
"street name" brokerage account.

   Additional information regarding the Plan may be obtained from Computershare,
P.O. Box 43081, Providence,  RI 02940-3081.  Information may also be obtained on
the internet at  www.computershare.com/equiserve  or by calling  Computershare's
Telephone  Response  Center at  1-781-575-2723  between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,

                         billed in connection with the review of registrant's
                         procedures related to compliance with its Exemptive
                         Order dated September 20, 2004.

               (c)       Tax Fees - The aggregate fees billed for professional

                         services provided by the independent auditors for 2006
                         and 2005.

               (e)(1)    The Audit Committee of the registrant has the sole
                         authority to pre-approve all audit and non-audit
                         services to be provided by the independent auditors,
                         subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit
                         services described in Section 10A(i)(1)B of the
                         Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") which
                         are approved by the Committee prior to the completion
                         of the audit. Any individual project that does not
                         exceed $25,000 may be pre-approved by the chair of the
                         Audit Committee. Any such pre-approval by the chair of
                         the Audit Committee must be presented to the full
                         Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Any proposed
                         services exceeding that cost level requires specific
                         pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Pre-approval of
                         audit and non-audit services shall not be required if
                         the engagement to render the services is entered into
                         pursuant to pre-approved policies and procedures
                         established by the Committee, provided the Committee is
                         informed of each such service. The Committee has not
                         established such policies and procedures.

               (e)(2)    None of the services described in paragraphs (b) - (d)
                         above were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to
                         paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

               (f)       Not applicable.

                         fiscal years ended November 30, 2006 and November 30,
                         2005 were $5,000 and $12,000, respectively.

Item 7.        Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
               Management Investment Companies.

                              ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         The following is a statement of the proxy voting policies and
procedures of ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company").

         PROXY ADMINISTRATION

         The Company understands its proxy voting responsibilities and that
proxy voting decisions may affect the long-term interests of its shareholders.
The Company attempts to process every proxy vote it receives. However, voting
proxies for shares of certain non-U.S. companies may involve significantly
greater effort and cost than for shares of U.S. companies. There may be
situations where the Company may not or cannot vote a proxy. For example, the
Company may receive proxy material too late to act upon or the cost of voting
may outweigh the benefit of voting.

         Authority and responsibility to vote proxies with respect to the
Company's portfolio securities has been delegated to the President and, in his
absence or inability to act, the Secretary. In evaluating proxy proposals, the
President (or Secretary, when appropriate) may consider information from various
sources, including management of the company presenting a proposal as well as
independent sources. The ultimate decision rests with the President (or
Secretary, when appropriate), who is accountable to the Board of Directors of
the Company.

         GENERAL PRINCIPLES

         In voting proxies, the Company will act solely in the best economic
interests of its shareholders with the goal of maximizing the value of the
Company's portfolio. These policies and procedures are designed to promote
accountability of a portfolio company's

<PAGE>

management and board of directors to its shareholders and to align their
interests with those of shareholders. These policies and procedures recognize
that a portfolio company's managers are entrusted with the day-to-day operations
of the company, as well as longer-term strategic planning, subject to the
company's board of directors.

         The Company believes that the quality and depth of a portfolio
company's management, including its board of directors, is an important
consideration in determining the desirability of an investment. Accordingly, the
recommendations of management on many issues are given substantial weight in
determining how to vote a proxy. However, each issue is considered on its own
merits, and the position of the portfolio company's management will not be
supported whenever it is determined not to be in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders.

         SPECIFIC POLICIES

         A.    ROUTINE MATTERS

               1.   ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. In general, the Company will vote in
                    favor of management's director nominees if they are running
                    unopposed. The Company believes that management is in the
                    best position to evaluate the qualifications of directors
                    and the needs of a particular board. Nevertheless, the
                    Company will vote against, or withhold its vote for, any
                    nominee whom it feels is not qualified. When management's
                    nominees are opposed in a proxy contest, the Company will
                    evaluate which nominee's publicly-announced management
                    policies and goals are most likely to maximize shareholder
                    value, as well as the past performance of the incumbent.

               2.   RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF AUDITORS. In general, the
                    Company will rely on the judgment of management in selecting
                    the independent auditors. Nevertheless, the Company will
                    examine the recommendation of management in appropriate
                    cases, e.g., where there has been a change in auditors based
                    upon a disagreement on accounting matters.

               3.   STOCK OPTION AND OTHER EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION PLAN
                    PROPOSALS. The Company will generally approve management's
                    recommendations with respect to the adoption or amendment of
                    stock option plans and other equity based compensation
                    plans, provided that the total number of shares reserved
                    under all of a company's plans is reasonable and not
                    excessively dilutive.

<PAGE>

         B.    ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS, REINCORPORATIONS, REORGANIZATIONS AND
               OTHER TRANSACTIONS

               Because voting on transactions such as acquisitions, mergers,
               reincorporations and reorganizations involve considerations
               unique to each transaction, the Company does not have a general
               policy in regard to voting on those transactions. The Company
               will vote on a case-by-case basis on each transaction.

         C.    CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE

               The Company evaluates proposed capital actions on a case-by-case
               basis and will generally defer to management's business analysis
               in support of such actions. In cases where proposed capital
               actions support proxy defenses or act to reduce or limit
               shareholder rights, particular consideration will be given to all
               the effects of the action and the Company's vote will be made in
               a manner consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term
               shareholder value.

         D.    ANTI-TAKEOVER PROPOSALS

               In general, the Company will vote against any proposal which the
               Company believes would materially contribute to preventing a
               potential acquisition or takeover, including proposals to:

                    o Stagger the board of directors;

                    o Introduce cumulative voting;

                    o Introduce unequal voting rights;

                    o Create supermajority voting;

                    o Establish preemptive rights.

               In general, the Company will vote in favor of any proposals to
               reverse the above.

         E.    SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS INVOLVING SOCIAL, MORAL OR ETHICAL MATTERS

               In general, the Company will vote in accordance with management's
               recommendation on issues that primarily involve social, moral or
               ethical matters, although exceptions may be made in certain
               instances where the Company believes a proposal has substantial
               economic implications.

         F.    CONFLICT OF INTEREST

               In view of the fact that the Company is internally managed and
               does not have an investment advisor, it is unlikely that
               conflicts of interest will

<PAGE>

               arise in voting the proxies of the Company's portfolio companies.
               The Company maintains a record of the affiliated persons of each
               director and officer of the Company including the President and
               Secretary. The Compliance Officer reviews proxy statement
               proposals to determine the existence of a potential conflict of
               interest. In the event that the President (or Secretary, when
               appropriate) has a personal conflict of interest, he shall remove
               himself from the voting process. In cases of a conflict of
               interest, a record shall be maintained confirming that the
               Company's vote was made solely in the interests of the Company
               and without regard to any other consideration.

               Date: November 10, 2005

Item 8.        Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

               Unless otherwise indicated, the information set forth below is as
               of November 30, 2006.

               (a)(1) Mr. Robert J.A. Irwin is responsible for the day-to-day
                      management of the registrant's portfolio and previously
                      was responsible for the day-to-day management of ASA's
                      portfolio. He has served the registrant as Chairman and
                      Treasurer since 2003 and President since 2004. He
                      previously served ASA as Chairman of the Board from 1993
                      to 2005 and as Treasurer from 1999 to 2005. The foregoing
                      information is provided as of January 12, 2007.

                  (2) Mr. Irwin is not responsible for the day-to-day management
                      of the portfolio of any other registered investment
                      company or other pooled investment vehicle. In his
                      capacity as a trustee of a charitable foundation (the
                      "Foundation") he is responsible for the day-to-day
                      management of an account (the "Account") maintained by the
                      Foundation having total assets of $5,219,513. Mr. Irwin
                      receives no compensation for his service as a trustee of
                      the Foundation. The Account includes securities of two
                      companies that are also held by the registrant. Those
                      securities have been held by the Foundation since at least
                      1999 and have a total value of $1,386,982. Mr. Irwin's
                      simultaneous management of the portfolios of the
                      registrant and the Account could present potential
                      conflicts of interest with respect to effecting trades in
                      the same securities. However, registrant believes that
                      these potential conflicts of interest do not have an
                      adverse effect on the portfolio management of the
                      registrant.

                  (3) Mr. Irwin's compensation consists of a fixed salary,
                      discretionary bonus and non-qualified pension benefit,
                      each as determined annually by the registrant's Board of
                      Directors upon the recommendation of its Compensation
                      Committee. In determining Mr. Irwin's compensation, the
                      Board of Directors and Compensation Committee consider his
                      overall performance and his management responsibilities
                      with the registrant including those not related to the
                      registrant's portfolio.

                  (4) Mr. Irwin beneficially owns common shares of registrant
                      having a value of over $100,000.

               (b)    Not applicable

Item 9.        Purchases of Equity Securities by Closed-end Management
               Investment Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

               During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
               made by or on behalf of the registrant or any "affiliated
               purchaser", as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange
               Act, of any common shares of the registrant.

Item 10.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

               There have been no material changes to the procedures by which
               shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of
               directors since the registrant provided disclosure in response to
               Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A in its proxy statement dated
               January 3, 2007.

Item 11.       Controls and Procedures

               (a)       The Chairman of the Board, President and Treasurer, in
                         his capacities as principal executive officer and
                         principal financial officer of the registrant, has
                         concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and
                         procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
                         Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")) are
                         effective, based on his evaluation of these controls
                         and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                         filing date of this report.

               (b)       There were no changes in the registrant's internal
                         control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
                         30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) that occurred during the
                         second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
                         report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
                         likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
                         control over financial reporting.

Item 12.       Exhibits.

               (a)(1)    The code of ethics that is the subject of disclosure
                         under Item 2 above is attached hereto.

                  (2)    The certification required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the
                         1940 Act is attached hereto.

                              ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       PURPOSE OF CODE OF ETHICS

         The Board of Directors of ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company") has adopted
this Code of Ethics ("Code") to promote the honest and ethical conduct of the
Covered Officers (as described below), including the ethical handling of actual
or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships; to promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents the Company files with, or submits to, the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
communications made by the Company; and to promote compliance with applicable
laws and governmental rules and regulations. This Code was adopted for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and forms
thereunder. Covered Officers, as well as others, are subject to other policies
and procedures in respect of their positions with the Company.

II.      INTRODUCTION

         The Code of Ethics is applicable to the Company's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer ("Covered Officers," each of whom is
identified on Exhibit A).

         Each Covered Officer is expected to act with integrity and honesty,
adhere to a high standard of business ethics and be sensitive to situations that
may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

         Waivers of this Code may be made only by the Board of Directors or the
Ethics Committee of the Board and will be disclosed in accordance with
applicable law.

III.     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interest of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Person used, or
attempted to use, his position with the Company to obtain any improper personal
benefit for himself, his family members, or any other person.

<PAGE>

         Certain conflicts of interest that may arise are already subject to
conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940
Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain
transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with
the Company because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The
Company's compliance programs and procedures are designed to address those
conflicts of interest and such conflicts are not covered by this Code.

         Although it is not possible to list and address every conceivable
conflict, the following are examples of actions that Covered Officers must take
to avoid conflict of interest situations. Each Covered Officer must not:

         o     use his personal influence or relationships improperly to
               influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the
               Company for the purpose of benefiting personally to the detriment
               of the Company;

         o     cause the Company to take actions, or fail to take action, for
               the personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
               benefit of the Company;

         o     without the approval of the President (or, with respect to the
               President, approval of the Ethics Committee), accept employment
               with or serve as a director of another investment company, an
               investment adviser or any public company;

         o     accept any business related gift in excess of $100;

         o     accept any entertainment from any company with which the Company
               has current or prospective business dealings unless such
               entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost,
               appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise
               any reasonable question of impropriety;

         o     without the approval of the President (or, with respect to the
               President, approval of the Ethics Committee), have or acquire any
               ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
               relationship with, any of the Company's service providers; and

         o     have a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
               transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
               portfolio transactions.

<PAGE>

IV.      COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE

         Each Covered Officer:

         o     is responsible for adhering to and promoting compliance with the
               standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
               regulations;

         o     is responsible for maintaining familiarity with the disclosure
               requirements applicable to the Company;

         o     shall not knowingly misrepresent, omit, or cause others to
               misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others,
               whether within or outside of the Company, including the Company's
               directors and independent auditors and governmental regulators;

         o     shall, to the extent appropriate within his area of
               responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
               Company and its service providers with the goal of promoting
               full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
               reports and documents the Company files with, or submits to, the
               SEC and in other public communications made by the Company;

         o     shall not coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence
               any auditor engaged in the performance of an audit of the
               Company's financial statements or accounting books and records;

         o     shall not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
               other officer or employee of the Company for reports of potential
               violations that are made in good faith.

         o     shall promptly bring to the attention of the President, the
               Ethics Committee and the Audit Committee any information he may
               have concerning (a) significant deficiencies and material
               weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
               financial reporting which are likely to adversely affect the
               Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
               financial information, and (b) any fraud, whether or not
               material, that involves management or other employees who have a
               significant role in the Company's internal control over financial
               reporting; and

         o     shall promptly bring to the attention of the Chief Legal Officer,
               the President and the Ethics Committee any information he may
               have concerning evidence of a material violation of the
               securities laws or other

<PAGE>

               laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company or of a
               violation of this Code.

V.       ACCOUNTABILITY

         The Ethics Committee shall have the power to monitor, investigate and
recommend action to the Board with respect to violations of this Code. The
Board, with the advice of the Ethics Committee, shall determine appropriate
actions to be taken in the event of violations of this Code by the Covered
Officers. Such actions shall be reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to
promote accountability for adherence to this Code. In determining what action is
appropriate in a particular case, the Board shall take into account all relevant
information, including the nature and severity of the violation, whether the
violation was a single occurrence or involved repeated occurrences, whether the
violation appears to have been intentional or inadvertent, whether the
individual in question had been advised prior to the violation as to the
appropriate course of action and whether or not the individual in question had
committed other violations in the past.

VI.      ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COVERED OFFICER

         Upon becoming subject to this Code, each Covered Officer must affirm in
writing to the Board that he has received, read and understands the Code.
Thereafter, each Covered Officer must affirm annually to the Board that he has
complied with the requirements of the Code.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY OF REPORTS AND RECORDS

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Board, the Ethics Committee, the
Audit Committee and, as appropriate, their advisers.

VIII.

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, including a majority of its
independent directors.

I, Robert J.A. Irwin, certify that:

         1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of ASA (Bermuda)
               Limited;

         2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
               statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
               necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
               circumstances under which such statements were made, not
               misleading with respect to the period covered by the report;

         3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
               financial information included in this report, fairly present in
               all material respects the financial condition, results of
               operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows (if the

               flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
               the report;

         4.    I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
               controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the

               financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
               Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

               a.   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                    such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                    my supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                    to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
                    is made known to me by others within those entities,
                    particularly during the period in which this report is being
                    prepared;

               b.   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                    caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
                    designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable
                    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
                    and the preparation of financial statements for external
                    purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
                    principles;

               c.   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                    controls and procedures and presented in this report my

                    controls and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior
                    to the filing date of this report based on such evaluation;

                    this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
                    likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
                    control over financial reporting; and


<PAGE>

         5.    I have disclosed to the registrant's auditors and the audit
               committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
               performing the equivalent functions):

               a.   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                    design or operation of internal control over financial
                    reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
                    the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and
                    report financial information; and

               b.   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                    or other employees who have a significant role in the
