To Our Shareholders ------------------------------------------------------------

December 9, 2005

        The year is ending with substantially good economic news. In China and
India it has been estimated that 25 million people are moving up to middle class
every year. These are people moving to indoor plumbing, electricity and standard
appliances from homes that had few or none of these things. It also means that
they need commodities like copper and oil in ever growing quantities. This has
provided the difference that has moved the energy markets from the glut of a
decade ago to the tight market and higher prices of today.

        In the U.S., economic and productivity growth have been better than
expected. Importantly, the consumer appears to be in very good fiscal health.
According to economist Ed Yardeni, the Federal Reserve reported that household
net worth was at an all-time record high of $51.1 trillion dollars at the end of
September 2005. Assets were at a record $62.5 trillion and liabilities were
$11.4 trillion. Corporations are also doing well; Dr. Yardeni estimates that in
the last four quarters, non-financial corporations have increased cash flow to
almost a trillion dollars.

        The U.S. Government's fiscal health may also be much better than we
think. Since we do not have a balance sheet showing both assets and liabilities,
we only have income, expenditures, deficits and debt. It may be that current
levels of deficits and debt are reasonable. If deficits are run while the
government's asset base is expanded (think roads, bridges, nature preserves,
ships, aircraft, etc.) then future generations are not burdened. We believe that
this is the case and that the private sector is not being 'crowded out' by
current deficit spending.

        All of the above sums up to a potentially very good year in 2006 for
commodity companies and financial firms. Since energy stocks have already done
well, perhaps they already reflect this news. We believe that there is still
room for these stocks to do well, but that the 'easy' gains are in the past.

        Our experience in 2005 to date has reflected the above as our energy
industry exposure has contributed to overall performance. The Fund's exposure to
finance and insurance has also contributed positively, while the
telecommunications industry holdings have underperformed this year.

        Bancroft Convertible Fund is the oldest closed-end convertible fund.
Founded in 1971, the Fund's strategy has consistently been to use convertible
securities as an equity alternative to reduce risk and volatility. This strategy
tends to outperform in bear markets and lag in bull markets. For the quarter,
year-to-date and ten-year periods ended October 31, 2005, Bancroft's NAV has
outperformed the average of the closed-end convertible fund category tracked by
Lipper, Inc. and published in the LIPPER CLOSED-END PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS.
However, for the one year and five years ended October 31, 2005, the Fund
underperformed the average of the eleven funds in its category. Of these eleven
funds, only four, including the Fund, remain unleveraged convertible funds and
only five, including the Fund, have more than 65% of their assets in convertible
securities. We believe these factors contributed to the difference in
performance between Bancroft and many of the other funds in the group.

        William A. Benton, independent director of the Fund since 1994, is
retiring from service at the end of his term in 2006. His contributions to the
Fund have been many. He will be missed.

Notes to Financial Statements --------------------------------------------------


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), established in 1971, is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial
statements:

(A) SECURITY VALUATION
Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at
market using the last reported sales price as of the close of regular trading.
Unlisted securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities
for which no sales were reported, are valued at the mean between closing
reported bid and asked prices as of the close of regular trading. Securities for
which quotations are not readily available, restricted securities and other
assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by management with
the approval of the Board of Directors. Short-term debt securities with initial
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

(B) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INVESTMENT INCOME
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy
or sell is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being
determined based upon identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including
accretion of discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain
securities, known as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in
addition to interest income actually received. Contingent interest income
amounted to 12 cents per share for the year ended October 31, 2005. In addition,
Federal tax regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains on
contingent payment debt instruments to interest income. At October 31, 2005
there were unrealized losses of approximately 8 cents per share on contingent
payment debt instruments.

(C) CHANGES IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BOND PREMIUM AND DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION
Effective November 1, 2004, the Fund began amortizing discounts and premiums on
all debt securities. Prior to November 1, 2004, the Fund amortized discounts on
original issue discount debt securities. The new method of amortization was
adopted in accordance with the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting
Guide, Audits of Investment Companies and the financial highlights and statement
of changes in net assets presented herein have been restated to reflect the new
method retroactive to November 1, 2001.

The effect of this accounting change is included in the financial highlights for
the years ended October 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, and in the statement of changes
in net assets for the year ended October 31, 2004. The cumulative effect of this
accounting change had no impact on the total net assets of the Fund or on
distributions for tax purposes, but resulted in a $103,986 increase in the cost
of securities held and a corresponding $103,986 reduction in the net unrealized
gains based on the securities held on November 1, 2001. The impact of this
change during the twelve months ended October 31, 2005 was to reduce net
investment income by $620,843, increase unrealized gains by $79,841 and increase
realized gains by $541,002. These changes had no effect on previously reported
total net assets or total returns.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Financial Statements (continued) --------------------------------------


(D) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all of its taxable income
within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore,
no provision for federal income or excise taxes is believed necessary.

The capital loss carryforward represents tax basis capital losses which may be
carried over to offset future realized capital gains. To the extent that the
carryforward is used, no capital gains distributions will be made. At October
31, 2005, the Fund had available for federal income tax purposes unused capital
losses of $4,596,296, available to offset future net capital gains, $4,045,634
of which expires in 2010 and $424,570 of which expires in 2011. The current
year's loss carryover of $126,092 will expire on October 31, 2013.

(E) DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Distributions to shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the
Fund on the ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are
recorded on the ex-dividend date and paid annually. The amount and character
of income and capital gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended
October 31, 2005 and 2004 were $3,894,853 and $3,826,570, respectively, both
from ordinary income.

At October 31, 2005 the components of distributable net assets and the federal
tax cost were as follows:

        Unrealized appreciation                        $  8,089,284
        Unrealized depreciation                          (3,853,448)
                                                       ------------
        Net unrealized appreciation                       4,235,836

        Undistributed ordinary income                     1,332,014

        Tax basis capital loss carryforward              (4,596,296)

        Cost for federal income tax purposes           $111,489,425

2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
The management fee is paid to the investment adviser, Davis-Dinsmore Management
Company (the "Adviser"). The contract provides for payment of a monthly advisory
fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the first $100,000,000 and 0.50% of
the excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net asset value in such month.

The Adviser furnishes investment advice, office equipment and facilities, and
pays the salaries of all executive officers of the Fund. The Fund pays all
expenses incurred by it and not assumed by the Adviser and in addition will pay
the costs and expenses of its Treasurer's office, up to a maximum of $25,000 per
year, incurred in connection with its performance of certain services for the
Fund. These services include the valuation of securities owned by the Fund, and
the preparation of financial statements and schedules of the Fund's investments
for inclusion in certain periodic reports to the Fund's Board of Directors and
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


                                                                         PAGE 13

Notes to Financial Statements (continued) --------------------------------------


3. CAPITAL STOCK
At October 31, 2005 there were 5,588,453 shares of $.01 par value common stock
outstanding (9,000,000 shares authorized). During the years ended October 31,
2005 and 2004, 31,315 shares and 33,362 shares were issued in connection with
reinvestment of dividends from net investment income, resulting in an increase
in paid-in capital of $582,476 and $628,542 respectively.

4. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY
Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $92,749,941 and $93,097,404, respectively, for the year ended October
31, 2005.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal Tax Information (unaudited) --------------------------------------------

In accordance with subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, for the year ended October 31, 2005, 18.5% of the dividends paid from
ordinary income qualified for the dividends received deduction for corporations.
Certain dividends paid by the Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005
may be subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%, as provided for by the Jobs and
Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The Fund intends to designate up
to a maximum amount of $721,114 as taxed at a maximum rate of 15%.

Shareholders should not use the above information to prepare their tax returns.
Since the Fund's fiscal year is not the calendar year, another notification will
be sent with respect to calendar year 2005. Such notification, which will
reflect the amount to be used by taxpayers on their federal income tax returns,
will be made in conjunction with Form 1099 DIV and will be mailed in January
2006. Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to
the tax consequences of their investment in the Fund.

Report of Independent Registered -----------------------------------------------
Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments of the Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund"), as of October 31, 2005, and the related statement of operations, the
statement of changes in net assets, and the financial highlights for the year
then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audit. The statement of changes in net assets for the year ended October 31,
2004 and the financial highlights for each of the years ended October 31, 2004,
October 31, 2003, October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001, have been audited by
other auditors, whose reports dated November 19, 2004, November 17, 2003,
November 18, 2002 and November 16, 2001 express an unqualified opinion.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
October 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. Where
brokers have not replied to our confirmation requests, we have carried out other
appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of the
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. as of October 31, 2005, the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, and its financial highlights for the
year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

- ---------------------- Board Approval of Advisory Contract ---------------------


IN OCTOBER 2005, THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF BANCROFT (I) RENEWED THE EXISTING
ADVISORY CONTRACT WITH DAVIS-DINSMORE MANAGEMENT COMPANY (THE "CURRENT ADVISORY
AGREEMENT") AND (II) APPROVED A NEW ADVISORY CONTRACT WITH DAVIS-DINSMORE
MANAGEMENT COMPANY (THE "NEW ADVISORY AGREEMENT" AND, TOGETHER WITH THE CURRENT
ADVISORY AGREEMENT, THE "ADVISORY AGREEMENTS"), SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
AT THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD IN FEBRUARY 2006. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE
MATERIAL FACTORS AND CONCLUSIONS THAT FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE RENEWAL OF THE
CURRENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND THE APPROVAL OF THE NEW ADVISORY AGREEMENT.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE ADVISORY SERVICES PROVIDED BY DAVIS-DINSMORE. The
Board and the independent directors reviewed the services to be provided by
Davis-Dinsmore under both Advisory Agreements. The Board noted that the terms of
the Current Advisory Agreement and the New Advisory Agreement were consistent in
that Davis-Dinsmore would supervise all aspects of the Company's operations
including the investment and reinvestment of cash, securities or other
properties comprising the Company's assets. In this regard, the Board noted that
under the Advisory Agreements it is Davis-Dinsmore's responsibility to, among
other things, (a) supervise all aspects of the operations of the Company; (b)
obtain and evaluate pertinent information about significant developments and
economic, statistical and financial data, domestic, foreign or otherwise,
whether affecting the economy generally or any industry or the Company or any
issuer of securities held or to be purchased by the Company; (c) determine which
issuers and securities shall be represented in the Company's investment
portfolio and regularly report thereon to the Board; (d) place orders for the
purchase and sale of securities for the Company; and (e) take, on behalf of the
Company, such other action as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with
the above.

With respect to the New Advisory Agreement, the Board and the independent
directors noted that no changes in the level or type of investment advisory
services provided under the Current Advisory Agreement with Davis-Dinsmore would
occur if the New Advisory Agreement was approved by shareholders. The Board
noted further that administration services provided under the Current Advisory
Agreement would not be provided under the New Advisory Agreement and that such
services would instead be provided under a new Administrative Services
Agreement.

Based on such review and comparison of the terms of the New Advisory Agreement
and the Current Advisory Agreement, both the Board and the independent directors
concluded that the range of services to be provided by Davis-Dinsmore under the
Advisory Agreements was appropriate.

THE QUALITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY DAVIS-DINSMORE. In reviewing the
qualifications of Davis-Dinsmore to provide investment advisory services, both
the Board and the independent directors reviewed the credentials and experience
of Davis-Dinsmore's investment personnel who will provide investment advisory
services to the Company, and considered Davis-Dinsmore's (i) portfolio and
product review process, particularly its adherance to the Company's investment
mandate, (ii) compliance function and its culture of compliance, (iii) use of
technology, (iv) investment research operations and trading operations, and (v)
focus on providing quality services while keeping the Company's fees and
expenses low. The Board and the independent directors also took into
consideration the presentations made by Davis-Dinsmore at prior Board meetings
pertaining to its management of the Company. Based on the review of these and
other factors, both the Board and the independent directors determined and
concluded that the quality of services to be provided by Davis-Dinsmore was
appropriate and that Davis-Dinsmore was qualified to continue to provide
investment advisory services to the Company.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS. Both the Board and
the independent directors reviewed the performance of the Company (at net asset
value) during the past one, three, five and ten years ended September 30, 2005
against the performance of other closed-end funds categorized to be in the
Company's peer group by Lipper, Inc. Both

<PAGE>

B A N C R O F T   C O N V E R T I B L E   F U N D
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Board Approval of Advisory Contract (continued) --------------------------------


the Board and the independent directors noted that the Company's performance for
the one, three, and five year periods was below the average performance of all
closed-end funds in the peer group, but was above the average performance of
such funds for the ten year period. In evaluating the Company's performance
against other funds in its peer group, the Board and the independent directors
took into account the fact that many of the Company's competitors engage in
leverage, which has increased their returns, but that the Company does not
engage in leverage. In addition, the Board and the independent directors
recognized that many of the Company's competitors have a higher percentage of
their assets invested in securities with lower credit quality than does the
Company, and that such securities have performed better than higher quality
securities in recent years. Because of the differences in how funds in the
Company's peer group are managed, the Board and the independent directors
concluded that they should consider the performance of the Company against
appropriate indices as a more relevant factor in assessing the performance of
the Company.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY RELATIVE TO INDICES. Both the Board and the
independent directors reviewed the performance of the Company (at net asset
value) during the past one, five and ten year fiscal years against the
performance of the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index and Merrill Lynch
Investment Grade Convertibles Index (the "Indices"). Both the Board and the
independent directors noted that, for the one year period, the Company's
performance was above the Indices' performance. The Board and the independent
directors noted that, for the five year period, the Company's performance (i)
adjusted for the Company's 2004 rights offering, was above the
Indices' performance, and (ii) not adjusted for the Company's 2004 rights
offering, was below the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index, but above the
Merrill Lynch Investment Grade Convertibles Index. The Board and the independent
directors also noted that, for the ten year period, the Company's performance
(both adjusted and not adjusted for the Company's 2004 rights offering) (i) was
below the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index, and (ii) was above the Merrill
Lynch Investment Grade Convertibles Index. Based on this review and taking into
account all of the other factors that the Board and the independent directors
considered in determining whether to approve the Advisory Agreements, the Board
and the independent directors concluded that no changes should be made to the
Company's investment objective or policies, or the portfolio management team.

MEETINGS WITH THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND INVESTMENT PERSONNEL. Both the
Board and the independent directors noted that they meet regularly with the
Company's portfolio manager and investment personnel, and believe that such
individuals are competent and able to continue to carry out their
responsibilities under the Advisory Agreements.

OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF DAVIS-DINSMORE. After considering the overall performance
of Davis-Dinsmore in providing investment advisory and administrative services
to the Company, both the Board and the independent directors concluded that such
performance was satisfactory.

FEES RELATIVE TO THOSE OF CLIENTS OF DAVIS-DINSMORE WITH COMPARABLE INVESTMENT
STRATEGIES. Both the Board and the independent directors noted that the Company
and Ellsworth Fund (the Funds) are the only clients of Davis-Dinsmore, and that
the advisory fee rates for the Funds are the same. Both the Board and the
independent directors concluded that, because the fee rates are the same for the
Funds, the current advisory fee rate of the Company was fair as compared to the
rate for Ellsworth Fund.

FEES RELATIVE TO THOSE OF COMPARABLE FUNDS WITH OTHER ADVISORS. After reviewing
the advisory fee rate for the Company against the advisory fee rates for funds
advised by other advisors in the Company's peer group both the Board and the
independent directors determined that the Company's advisory fee rate was at
approximately the median of the funds in its peer group, and concluded that the
current advisory fee rate of the Company was fair and reasonable.


                                                                         PAGE 17

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ---------------- Board Approval of Advisory Contract (continued) ---------------


EXPENSE LIMITATIONS AND FEE WAIVERS. Both the Board and the independent
directors noted that, although there are no contractual expense limitations or
fee waivers in effect for the Company, Davis-Dinsmore is very diligent in its
efforts to keep expenses of the Company as low as possible. Both the Board and
the independent directors also noted that the Company's expense ratio had
declined as a result of the Company's rights offering during the 2004 fiscal
year, but that the cost of compliance with regulatory initiatives was
increasing. Both the Board and the independent directors concluded that the
current level of expenses for the Company was reasonable.

BREAKPOINTS AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. Both the Board and the independent directors
reviewed the structure of the Company's advisory fee under the Current Advisory
Agreement, and noted that the fee includes a significant breakpoint when the
Company's assets reach $100 million. Both the Board and the independent
directors noted that breakpoints had become effective as a result of the
Company's rights offering that occurred during the 2004 fiscal year, which
resulted in lower management fee expenses as a percentage of assets. Both the
Board and the independent directors concluded that it was not necessary to
implement any further changes to the structure of the advisory fee for the
Company.

PROFITABILITY OF DAVIS-DINSMORE. Both the Board and the independent directors
reviewed information concerning the profitability and financial condition of
Davis-Dinsmore. In particular, the Board reviewed Davis-Dinsmore's financial
statements including its income statement and audited balance sheet. The Board
also reviewed Davis-Dinsmore's costs in providing services to the Funds. The
Board noted that Davis-Dinsmore's sole source of revenue was fees from the Funds
for providing advisory and administrative services to the Funds. The Board noted
that if the New Advisory Agreement is approved, the Company will enter into the
Administrative Services Agreement with Davis-Dinsmore, which will provide a
source of revenue for Davis-Dinsmore. The Board and the independent directors
noted that Davis-Dinsmore's operations remain profitable, but that increased
expenses in recent years have reduced Davis-Dinsmore's profitability. The Board
also noted that increasing the success of the Funds will positively impact
Davis-Dinsmore's profitability.

Based on the review of the profitability of Davis-Dinsmore and its financial
condition, both the Board and the independent directors concluded that the
compensation to be paid by the Company to Davis-Dinsmore under the Advisory
Agreements was not excessive.

BENEFITS OF SOFT DOLLARS TO DAVIS-DINSMORE. Both the Board and the independent
directors discussed the fact that there are no third-party soft dollar
arrangements in effect with respect to the Company. Both the Board and the
independent directors recognized that Davis-Dinsmore does receive proprietary
research from brokers with whom it executes portfolio transactions on behalf of
the Company. This research is used by Davis-Dinsmore in making investment
decisions for the Company. Both the Board and the independent directors also
considered representations made by Davis-Dinsmore that portfolio transactions
received best execution. Because such research ultimately benefits the Company,
the Board and the independent directors concluded that it was appropriate to
receive proprietary research.

DAVIS-DINSMORE'S FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS IN LIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S NEEDS. Both the
Board and the independent directors considered whether Davis-Dinsmore is
financially sound and has the resources necessary to perform its obligations
under the Advisory Agreements, and concluded that Davis-Dinsmore has the
financial resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Advisory
Agreements.

HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND DAVIS-DINSMORE. In determining
whether to approve the Advisory Agreements for the Company, both the Board and
the independent directors also considered the prior relationship between
Davis-Dinsmore and the Company, as well as the independent directors' knowledge
of Davis-Dinsmore's operations, and concluded

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ---------------- Board Approval of Advisory Contract (continued) ---------------


that it was beneficial to maintain the current relationship, in part, because of
such knowledge. Both the Board and the independent directors also reviewed the
general nature of the non-investment advisory services currently performed by
Davis-Dinsmore, such as administrative services, and the fees received by
Davis-Dinsmore for performing such services. The Board noted that if the New
Advisory Agreement is approved, the Company will enter into the Administrative
Services Agreement with Davis-Dinsmore, and such administrative services would
be provided pursuant to such agreement. In addition to reviewing such services,
both the Board and the independent directors also considered the organizational
structure employed by Davis-Dinsmore to provide those services. Based on the
review of these and other factors, both the Board and the independent directors
concluded that Davis-Dinsmore was qualified to continue to provide non-
investment advisory services to the Company, including administrative services,
and that Davis-Dinsmore currently is providing satisfactory non-investment
advisory services.

OTHER FACTORS AND CURRENT TRENDS. Both the Board and the independent directors
considered the culture of compliance and high ethical standards at
Davis-Dinsmore, and the efforts historically and currently undertaken by
Davis-Dinsmore to engage in best practices. Both the Board and the independent
directors noted Davis-Dinsmore's historical adherence to compliance procedures,
as well as the Company's investment objectives, policies and restrictions. Both
the Board and the independent directors concluded that this commitment to adhere
to the highest ethical standards was an important factor in their determination
that they should renew the Current Advisory Agreement and approve the New
Advisory Agreement for the Company.

BREAKOUT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. With respect to the New Advisory Agreement,
the Board and the independent directors considered the fact that the
administrative services being provided by Davis-Dinsmore under the Current
Advisory Agreement were not included in the New Advisory Agreement, and instead
are set forth in a new Administrative Services Agreement. When evaluating the
new Administrative Services Agreement, the Board and the independent directors
considered (i) the additional administrative services provided by Davis-Dinsmore
in recent years due to increased regulation, (ii) the additional expenses
incurred by Davis-Dinsmore in providing such services, and (iii) that the
Company has reimbursed Davis-Dinsmore $25,000 each year (which is the
maximum amount permitted to be reimbursed under the Current Advisory Agreement)
since 1988 for expenses incurred by the Treasurer's Office in performing
administrative services. As a result, the Board and the independent directors
concluded (i) that the new Administrative Services Agreement should be
structured so that Davis-Dinsmore is not required to seek reimbursement for its
costs in providing administrative services but rather be paid fixed compensation
in the amount of $25,000 for providing such services, and (ii) that such
arrangement was fair and reasonable. In concluding the new Administrative
Service Agreement was fair and reasonable, the Board and the independent
directors considered, in addition to the factors set forth above, the Company's
need for the provision of administrative services, the quality of administrative
services provided by Davis-Dinsmore in the past, the amounts to be paid under
the Administrative Services Agreement, and how the amounts paid to
Davis-Dinsmore under the Administrative Services Agreement impact
Davis-Dinsmore's profitability. The Board and the independent directors also
considered the fact that in the future, the fees for administrative services
could be increased by the Board without shareholder approval. Both the Board and
the independent directors concluded that this breakout of administrative
services was an important factor in their determination that they should approve
the New Advisory Agreement for the Company.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After considering the above factors, the Board concluded that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders to renew the Current Advisory
Agreement and approve the New Advisory Agreement.

Miscellaneous Notes ------------------------------------------------------------


AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND INVESTMENT AND CASH PAYMENT PLAN

The Fund has an Automatic Dividend Investment and Cash Payment Plan (the
"Plan"). Any shareholder may elect to join the Plan by sending an application to
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, P.O. Box 922, Church Street Station, NY
10269-0560 (the "Plan Agent"). You may obtain additional information about the
Plan by calling the Plan Agent toll free at (800) 937-5449. If your shares are
held by a broker or other nominee, you should instruct the nominee to join the
Plan on your behalf. Some brokers may require that your shares be taken out of
the broker's "street name" and reregistered in your own name. Shareholders
should also contact their broker to determine whether shares acquired through
participation in the Plan can be transferred to another broker, and thereafter,
whether the shareholder can continue to participate in the Plan.

Under the Plan, all dividends and distributions are automatically invested in
additional Fund shares. Depending on the circumstances, shares may either be
issued by the Fund or acquired through open market purchases at the current
market price or net asset value, whichever is lower (but not less than 95% of
market price). When the market price is lower, the Plan Agent will combine your
dividends with those of other Plan participants and purchase shares in the
market, thereby taking advantage of the lower commissions on larger purchases.
There is no other charge for this service.

All dividends and distributions made by the Fund (including capital gain
distributions and dividends designated as qualified dividend income, which are
eligible for taxation at lower rates) remain taxable to Plan participants,
regardless of whether such dividends and distributions are reinvested in
additional shares of the Fund through open market purchases or through the
issuance of new shares. Plan participants will be treated as receiving the cash
used to purchase shares on the open market and, in the case of any dividend or
distribution made in the form of newly issued shares, will be treated as
receiving an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares as of the
reinvestment date. Accordingly, a shareholder may incur a tax liability even
though such shareholder has not received a cash distribution with which to pay
the tax.

Plan participants may also voluntarily send cash payments of $100 to $10,000 per
month to the Plan Agent, to be combined with other Plan monies, for purchase of
additional Fund shares in the open market. You pay only a bank service charge of
$1.25 per transaction, plus your proportionate share of the brokerage
commission. All shares and fractional shares purchased will be held by the Plan
Agent in your dividend reinvestment account. You may deposit with the Plan Agent
any Bancroft stock certificates you hold, for a one-time fee of $7.50.

At any time, a Plan participant may instruct the Plan Agent to liquidate all or
any portion of such Plan participant's account. To do so, a Plan participant
must deliver written notice to the Plan Agent prior to the record date of any
dividend or distribution requesting either liquidation or a stock certificate.
The Plan Agent will combine all liquidation requests it receives from Plan
participants on a particular day and will then sell shares of the Fund that are
subject to liquidation requests in the open market. The amount of proceeds a
Plan participant will receive shall be determined by the average sales price per
share, after deducting brokerage commissions, of all shares sold by the Plan
Agent for all Plan participants who have given the Plan Agent liquidation
requests.

The Plan Agent or the Fund may terminate the Plan for any reason at any time by
sending written notice addressed to Plan participant's address as shown on the
Plan Agent's records. Following the date of termination, the Plan Agent shall
send the Plan participant either the proceeds of liquidation, or a stock
certificate or certificates for the full shares held by the Plan Agent in the
Plan participant's account. Additionally, a check will be sent for the value of
any fractional interest in the Plan participant's account based on the market
price of the Fund's Common Stock on that date.

under the following conditions: (i) the specific purpose of the disclosure is to
assist the Adviser in identifying potential investment opportunities for the
Funds; (ii) prior to the receipt of nonpublic portfolio holdings, the broker, by
means of e-mail or other written communication, shall agree to keep the
nonpublic portfolio holdings confidential and not to use the information for the
broker's own benefit, except in connection with the above described purpose for
which it was disclosed; (iii) the Adviser shall keep written records of its
agreement with each broker to which it distributes nonpublic portfolio holdings;
and (iv) the Adviser will secure a new agreement with a broker any time the
broker directs the nonpublic portfolio holdings to be sent to a new recipient.

Non-Audit Services

     During each of the last two fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and
September 30, 2005, PwC and Tait Weller did not provide any non-audit services
to the Company or Davis-Dinsmore or its affiliates or otherwise bill the
Company or Davis-Dinsmore or its affiliates for any such non-audit services.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

     The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit
services that are proposed to be provided to the Company by its independent
auditors before they are provided to the Company.  Such pre-approval also
includes the proposed fees to be charged by the independent auditors for such
services.  The Audit Committee may delegate the pre-approval of audit and
permissible non-audit services and related fees to one or more members of the
Audit Committee who are "independent," as such term is used in Form N-CSR.
Any such member's decision to pre-approve audit and/or non-audit services and
related fees shall be presented to the full Audit Committee, solely for
informational purposes, at their next scheduled meeting.

     The Audit Committee also pre-approves non-audit services to be provided by
the Company's independent auditors to the Company's investment adviser if the
engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Company and if the Company's independent auditors are the same as, or affiliated
with, the investment adviser's auditors.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


                         Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
               Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income Fund, Inc.
                        Davis-Dinsmore Management Company
                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

                            (Adopted April 14, 2003)

These proxy voting guidelines have been adopted by the Boards of Directors of
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. and Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income
Fund, Inc. (collectively, the "Funds"), as well as by the Board of Directors of
Davis-Dinsmore Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore").

The Boards of Directors of the Funds have delegated to Davis-Dinsmore
responsibility for voting proxies received by the Funds in their capacities as
shareholders of various companies.  The Boards recognize that, due to the nature
of the Funds' investments, the Funds do not frequently receive proxies.

Davis-Dinsmore exercises its voting responsibility with the overall goal of
maximizing the value of the Funds' investments.  The portfolio managers at
Davis-Dinsmore oversee the voting policies and decisions for the Funds.
In evaluating voting issues, the portfolio managers may consider information
from many sources, including management of a company presenting a proposal,
shareholder groups, research analysts, and independent proxy research services.

Set forth below are the proxy voting guidelines:

A.   Matters Related to the Board of Directors

     1.   The Funds generally will support the election of nominees recommended
by management for election as directors.  In determining whether to support a
particular nominee, Davis-Dinsmore will consider whether the election of that
nominee will cause a company to have less than a majority of independent
directors.

     2.   The Funds generally will support proposals to de-classify boards of
directors if fewer than 66 2/3% of the directors are independent, and will
generally vote against proposals to classify boards of directors.

     3.   The Funds generally will withhold a vote in favor of a director who
has served on a committee which has approved excessive compensation arrangements
or proposed equity-based compensation plans that unduly dilute the ownership
interests of stockholders.

B.   Matters Related to Independent Auditors

     1.   The Funds generally will vote in favor of independent accountants
approved by the company.  Prior to such vote, however, Davis-Dinsmore will take
into consideration whether non-audit fees make up more than 50 to 75% of the
total fees paid by the company to the independent auditors, and the nature of
the non-audit services provided.

C.   Corporate Governance Matters

     1.   As a general rule, the Funds will vote against proposals recommended
by management of a company that are being made primarily to implement anti-
takeover measures, and will vote in favor of proposals to eliminate policies
that are primarily intended to act as anti-takeover measures.

     2.   Subject to the other provisions of these guidelines, including without
limitation provision C.1. above, the Funds generally will vote in accordance
with management's recommendations regarding routine matters, including the
following:

          a.   Fixing number of directors;

          b.   Stock splits; and

          c.   Change of state of incorporation for specific corporate purposes.

D.   Matters Related to Equity-Based Compensation Plans

     1.   The Fund generally will vote in favor of broad-based stock option
plans for executives, employees or directors which would not increase the
aggregate number of shares of stock available for grant under all currently
active plans to over 10% of the total number of shares outstanding.

     2.   The Funds generally will vote in favor of employee stock purchase
plans and employee stock ownership plans permitting purchase of company stock at
85% or more of fair market value.

E.   Contested Matters

     1.   Contested situations will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the
portfolio manager at Davis-Dinsmore principally responsible for the particular
portfolio security.

F.   Miscellaneous Matters

     1.   The Funds may in their discretion abstain from voting shares that have
been recently sold.

     2.   The Funds generally will abstain from voting on issues relating to
social and/or political responsibility.

     3.   Proposals that are not covered by the above-stated guidelines will be
evaluated on a case by case basis by the portfolio manager at Davis-Dinsmore
principally responsible for the particular portfolio security.


G.   Material Conflicts of Interest

     1.   Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time between Davis-
Dinsmore and the Funds.  Examples of conflicts of interests include:

          a.   Davis-Dinsmore may manage a pension plan, administer employee
     benefit plans, or provide services to a company whose management is
     soliciting proxies;

          b.   Davis-Dinsmore or its officers or directors may have a business
     or personal relationship with corporate directors, candidates for
     directorships, or participants in proxy contests;

          c.   Davis-Dinsmore may hold a position in a security contrary to
     shareholder interests.

     2.   If a conflict of interest arises with respect to a proxy voting
matter, the portfolio manager will promptly notify the Funds' Audit Committee
and counsel for independent directors and the proxies will be voted in
accordance with direction received from the Audit Committee.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Not currently applicable to registrant.

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases made by or
on behalf of the registrant or any "affiliated purchaser," as defined in Rule
10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of shares or
other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities that is
registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
(15 U.S.C. 781).

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may
recommend nominees to the Registrant's board of directors since those procedures
were last disclosed in response to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of
Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item 10 of Form N-CSR.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of November 11, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the officers of Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
(the "Registrant"), including the Principal Executive Officer ("PEO") and
Principal Financial Officer ("PFO"), to assess the effectiveness of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in
Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended.
Based on that evaluation, the Registrant's officers, including the PEO and PFO,
concluded that, as of November 11, 2005, the Registrant's disclosure controls
and procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information
required to be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that material information
relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and PFO as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the Registrant's second fiscal
quarter of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

(a)(1) A code of ethics, effective May 15, 2003, that applies to the Fund's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer is attached
hereto.

(a)(2) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 are attached hereto.

(a)(3) There were no written solicitations to purchase securities under Rule
23c-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 during the period covered by the
report.

(b) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer, as required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 are attached hereto.

EX-99.CODE ETH

Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income Fund, Inc.

Code of Ethics for Principal Officers
Adopted Effective May 15, 2003

I.   Preamble
   This Code of Ethics ("Code") is adopted by the Board of Directors of
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. and Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income
Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") in accordance with Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the code of ethics standards established in applicable rules
and regulations under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  The
Funds are adopting this Code to establish as a policy of the Funds written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
1. Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
professional relationships;
2. Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in
reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") and in
other public communications made by the Funds;
3. Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and
regulations;
4. The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
5. Accountability for adherence to the Code.
II.  Applicability
The provisions of this Code shall apply to all Principal Officers of
the Funds.
III. Definitions
   Principal Officer means the principal executive officer, principal
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
performing similar functions on behalf of the Funds regardless of whether these
individuals are employed by the Funds or by a third party, including Davis-
Dinsmore Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore").
   Compliance Officer means the Chief Compliance Officer of the Funds or
his/her designee.
   Independent Directors means the directors of the Funds who are not
"interested persons" of the Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act.
   Investment Company Act means the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.
IV. Principal Officers Should Act Honestly and Candidly
   Each Principal Officer owes a duty to the Funds to act with
integrity.  Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid.
Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.  Each
Principal Officer must:
1. Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while
still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required
by law or the Funds' policies;
2. Observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules
and regulations, accounting standards and Fund policies;
3. Adhere to a high standard of business ethics; and
4. Place the interests of the Funds before the Principal Officer's
own personal interests.
   All activities of Principal Officers should be guided by and adhere
to these fiduciary standards.
V.  Principal Officers Should Handle Actual and Apparent Conflicts of Interest
Ethically
   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Principal Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Funds.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Principal Officer, or a member
of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position
in the Funds.
   Certain conflicts of interest covered by this Code arise out of the
relationships between Principal Officers and the Funds that already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Funds' and Davis-Dinsmore's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures.
   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Funds and Davis-Dinsmore of which the Principal
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes
that the Principal Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Funds or for Davis-Dinsmore, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different
effects on Davis-Dinsmore and the Funds.  The participation of the Principal
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Funds and Davis-Dinsmore and is consistent with the performance by the
Principal Officers of their duties as officers of the Funds and, if addressed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition, it is recognized by the Board of Directors that the Principal
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment
companies covered by this or other Codes.
   Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and
the Investment Advisers Act.  In reading the following examples of conflicts
of interest under the Code, Principal Officers should keep in mind that such a
list cannot ever be exhaustive by covering every possible scenario.
It follows that the overarching principle - that the personal interest of a
Principal Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Funds - should be the guiding principle in all circumstances.
   Each Principal Officer must:
1. Avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible;
2. Handle any actual or apparent conflict of interest ethically;
3. Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by an
investment company whereby the Principal Officer would benefit
personally to the detriment of the Funds;
4. Not cause the Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for
the personal benefit of the Principal Officer rather than to benefit
such Funds;
5. Not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
made or contemplated for the Funds to profit personally, or cause
others to profit, from the market effect of such transactions;
6. Discuss any material transaction or relationship that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest with
the Compliance Officer; and
7. Complete annually all sections of the Funds' Directors and
Officers Questionnaire pertaining to affiliations or other
relationships related to conflicts of interest.
   Types of conflict of interest situations that should be discussed
with the Compliance Officer, if material, are:
* any outside business activity that detracts from an individual's
ability to devote appropriate time and attention to his
responsibilities with the Funds;
* service as a director on the board of any public or private
company;
* the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;
* the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
Funds have current or prospective business dealings unless such
entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
raise any question of impropriety;
* any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
relationship with, any of the Funds' service providers, other
than Davis-Dinsmore or any affiliated person thereof;
* a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
transaction charges or spreads paid by the Funds for effecting
portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
than an interest arising from the Principal Officer's
employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.
VI. Disclosure
   Each Principal Officer must:
1. Familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements applicable
to the Funds as well as the business and financial operations of the
Funds; and
2. Not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
facts about the Funds to others, whether within or outside the Funds,
including to the Funds' directors and auditors, and to governmental
regulators and self-regulatory organizations.
3. To the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility,
consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and Davis-
Dinsmore and take other appropriate steps with the goal of promoting
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
in other public communications made by the Funds.
VII. Compliance
   It is the Funds' policy to comply with all applicable laws and
governmental rules and regulations.  It is the personal responsibility of each
Principal Officer to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those
laws, rules and regulations.
VIII. Reporting and Accountability
            Each Principal Officer must:
1. Upon receipt of the Code, sign and submit to the Compliance
Officer an Acknowledgement stating that he or she has received, read,
and understands the Code.
2. By April 30 of each year submit an Acknowledgement Form to the
Compliance Officer confirming that he or she has received, read and
understands the Code and has complied with the requirements of the
Code as of the date of signing.
3. Not retaliate against any employee or Principal Officer for
reports of potential violations that are made in good faith; and
4. Notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he becomes aware of
any existing or potential violation of this Code.  Failure to do so
is itself a violation of this Code.
IX. Review and Enforcement Procedures
    Except as described otherwise below, the Compliance Officer is
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions
are presented to it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any
particular situation.  The following procedures apply in investigating and
enforcing this Code, and in reporting on the Code:
1. The Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to
investigate any violations reported to it;
2. Violations and potential violations will be reported to the
Audit Committee (the "Committee"), counsel to the Funds and counsel
to the Independent Directors after such investigation;
3. If the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
will inform the Independent Directors who will take all appropriate
disciplinary or preventive action;
4. Appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a
review of and appropriate modifications to applicable policies and
procedures, notification of appropriate personnel at Davis- Dinsmore,
a letter of censure, or recommendation of suspension or dismissal;
5. The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting
waivers, as appropriate; and
6. Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR as provided by SEC rules.
X. Periodic Review
   At least annually, the Principal Officers and the Compliance Officer
will prepare a written report to the Boards of Directors of the Funds
describing any issues arising under this Code or procedures, including but not
limited to, information about material violations of this Code or procedures
and any sanctions imposed in response to those material violations.
   The Boards of Directors of the Funds will review this Code on an
annual basis.
XI. Other Policies and Procedures
   The Funds' and Davis-Dinsmore's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1
under the Investment Company Act are separate documents applying to Principal
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.
XII. Amendments
   This Code may not be amended except in written form, which is
specifically approved by a majority vote of the Funds' Boards of Directors,
including a majority of independent directors.
XIII. Confidentiality
   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
shall be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly.  Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Funds, Davis-Dinsmore, the
Board of Directors, and counsel to the foregoing.
XIV. Internal Use
   The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
