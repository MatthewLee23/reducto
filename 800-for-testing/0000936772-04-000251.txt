Semi-Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund"), a closed-end fund that trades
under the New York Stock Exchange symbol "AWF", for the semi-annual reporting
period ended September 30, 2004.

Investment Objective and Policies

This closed-end fund is designed for investors who seek high current income
and, secondarily, capital appreciation. To achieve this objective, it invests
primarily in high yielding, high risk sovereign debt and U.S. corporate
fixed-income obligations that we expect to benefit from improving economic and
credit fundamentals. For more information regarding the Fund's risks, please
see the "Word About Risk" section on page 4 and "Note E-Risks Involved in
Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to Financial Statements on page 21.

Investment Results

The table on page 5 shows the Fund's performance compared to its benchmark, the
J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+), which is a standard
measure of the performance of a basket of unmanaged emerging market debt
securities, for the six- and 12-month periods ended September 30, 2004.

Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II underperformed its benchmark, the JPM
EMBI+, for the semi-annual period, but outperformed its benchmark for the
annual period ended September 30, 2004.

Detracting from the Fund's performance during the semi-annual period was its
overweighted position in Ecuador, which was particularly hurt in the bond
market sell-off in April. Political noise and uncertainty regarding Ecuador's
International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding hurt the country's debt prices during
the period. Additionally, the Fund's overweighted position in Russia throughout
most of the period detracted from its performance, as Russian debt lagged other
emerging market country returns. Also detracting from performance was the
Fund's overall shorter duration positioning that dampened returns when the
emerging markets began to rally in July.

Contributing positively to performance were the Fund's holdings in Venezuela.
Performance was particularly enhanced in May when Venezuela was only one of
three emerging countries to post a positive return. Venezuela benefited from a
clarification of its political leadership and high oil prices during the
period. Also contributing positively to the Fund's performance was its increase
in Argentinian debt toward the end of the period, which benefited from positive
news regarding its final debt restructuring.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

The emerging market debt class, as represented by the JPM EMBI+, returned a
moderate 2.99% for the semi-annual period ended September 30, 2004. The
moderate return, however, masked several volatile months within the reporting
period. After very strong returns in 2003 and the beginning of 2004, the


_______________________________________________________________________________

ALLIANCE WORLD DOLLAR GOVERNMENT FUND II o 1


semi-annual reporting period began with a sharp bond market sell-off. Early in
April, bond markets sold off dramatically after a surprisingly strong gain in
March U.S. payroll employment, sending emerging-market returns into negative
territory. Concerns that the Federal Reserve would begin tightening interest
rates sooner than expected also surfaced. For the first two months of the
period, April and May, emerging-market debt returns fell by 7.37%.

Later in the period, however, soft consumer confidence readings, weak inflation
data and lower payroll numbers allowed emerging market debt to rebound as the
U.S. economy hit a mid-year slowdown. The prospects of slower, more measured,
Federal Reserve tightenings moved emerging market debt back into positive
territory for the reporting period.

For the six-months ended September 30, 2004, the Latin region outpaced
non-Latin markets returning 4.50% and 0.71%, respectively, as measured by the
JPM EMBI+. During this time Latin countries benefited from export demand and
strong commodity prices, particularly oil. Sustained growth in the region
resulted in a decline in fiscal deficits, which improved the macroeconomic
fundamentals. Countries within the JPM EMBI+ that outperformed for the
semi-annual period included the oil producing countries Venezuela and Brazil.
During the six-month period ended September 30, 2004, Venezuela returned 13.70%
and Brazil returned 8.23%, as measured by the JPM EMBI+. Countries within the
JPM EMBI+ that underperformed for the six-month period were Russia, which
returned -1.08%, Ecuador at -0.82%, Bulgaria at -0.26% and the Ukraine at
- -0.16%.

During the semi-annual reporting period ended September 30, 2004, we focused on
reducing the Fund's duration exposure, positioning the Fund for higher interest
rates. We continued to maintain allocations to the Fund's core emerging market
countries (Brazil, Russia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Turkey, Venezuela, and the
Ukraine); however, we adjusted the Fund's country weightings during the period.
The Fund generally maintained an overweighted position in Russian debt early in
the period, as credit statistics continued to improve and Russia benefited from
higher oil prices. In July, however, we reduced the Fund's Russian holdings as
positive economic fundamentals were offset by administrative paralysis and the
Yukos affair. Russia's Justice Ministry had seized the assets of Yukos, the
country's largest oil producer, and was preparing to sell its main
oil-producing unit in Siberia to recover payment of back taxes. Furthermore,
there was a significant negative change in Russia's sovereign supply and demand
technicals.

Additionally, we increased the Fund's exposure in Brazil as growth in Brazil
exceeded even our most optimistic forecast, easing worries about debt
sustainability. Additionally we anticipated that Brazilian debt would benefit
from anticipated ratings upgrades. Subsequently, Brazil was upgraded by Moody's
from a B2 to a B1 rating.

We also increased the Fund's position in the Ukraine during the period due to
strong economic growth and prospects for rating upgrades. Toward the end of the
semi-annual reporting period, we also increased the Fund's Argentinean debt due
to significant indications that a new, final restructuring offer would benefit
investors.

Benchmark Disclosure

The unmanaged J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+) does not
reflect fees and expenses associated with the active management of a mutual
fund portfolio. The Index is comprised of dollar-denominated restructured
sovereign bonds; a large percentage of the Index is made up of Brady bonds.
Investors cannot invest directly in an index, and its results are not
indicative of any specific investment, including the Fund.

A Word About Risk

The Fund invests in fixed income foreign securities, including those of
emerging markets, which may magnify portfolio fluctuations due to changes in
foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to
political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries. While the Fund
invests principally in bonds and other fixed income securities, in order to
achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain types of
investment derivatives, such as options, forwards and swaps. These instruments
involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than, the risks
presented by more traditional investments. At the discretion of the Fund's
Adviser, the Fund may invest substantially all of its net assets in bonds that
are rated below investment grade ("junk bonds") and up to 50% in securities
that are not readily marketable.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2004 (unaudited)

NOTE A

Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Maryland on May 20, 1993 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities not listed on an exchange but traded on The
NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ
Official Closing Price; listed put or call options are valued at the last sale
price. If there has been no sale on that day, such securities will be valued at
the closing bid prices on that day; open futures contracts and options thereon
are valued using the closing settlement price or, in the absence of such a
price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are no quotations available
for the day of valuation, the last available closing settlement price is used;
securities traded in the over-the-counter market, (OTC) (but excluding
securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid and
asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable
sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having 60 days
or less remaining until maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original
maturity was 60 days or less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st
day prior to maturity if their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days;
fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed and asset backed securities,
may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a
price obtained from one or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where
broker/dealer quotes are obtained, Alliance Capital Management, L.P. (the
"Adviser") may


_______________________________________________________________________________

16 o ALLIANCE WORLD DOLLAR GOVERNMENT FUND II


                                                  Notes to Financial Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

establish procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads are used to
adjust, on a daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a security; and
OTC and other derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or
spread from a major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because, most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required. The Fund may be subject to taxes imposed by countries in which it
invests. Such taxes are generally based on income and/or capital gains earned
or repatriated. Taxes are accrued and applied to net investment income, net
realized gains and net unrealized appreciation/depreciation as such income
and/or gains are earned.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund accretes discounts as
adjustments to interest income. Additionally, the Fund amortizes premiums on
debt securities for financial statement reporting purposes.

4. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with
federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent these differences
are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based
on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not require such
reclassification.

NOTE B

Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.

Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser an
administrative fee at an annual rate of .15% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Adviser provides
administrative functions as well as other clerical services to the Fund and
prepares financial and regulatory reports.

The Fund entered into a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance
Global Investor Services, Inc. ("AGIS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Adviser, whereby the Fund reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone
inquiries on behalf of the Fund. During the six months ended September 30,
2004, there was no reimbursement paid to AGIS.

NOTE C

Investment Transactions

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the six months ended September 30, 2004, were as follows:


                                                   Purchases          Sales
                                                 =============    =============
Investment securities (excluding
  U.S. government securities)                    $ 804,667,169    $ 835,218,882
U.S. government securities                                  -0-              -0-


The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was substantially the
same as the cost for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, gross
unrealized appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap contracts)
are as follows:

Gross unrealized appreciation                                     $ 101,456,443
Gross unrealized depreciation                                        (2,377,426)
                                                                  -------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                       $  99,079,017
                                                                  =============


1. Option Transactions

For hedging and investment purposes, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) put
and call options on U.S. and foreign government securities and foreign
currencies that are traded on U.S. and foreign securities exchanges and
over-the-counter markets.

The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the risk
of loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not
perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for


_______________________________________________________________________________

18 o ALLIANCE WORLD DOLLAR GOVERNMENT FUND II


                                                  Notes to Financial Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


in the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired
through the exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The
proceeds from securities sold through the exercise of put options are decreased
by the premiums paid.

When the Fund writes an option, the premium received by the Fund is recorded as
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of the
option written. Premiums received from written options which expire unexercised
are recorded by the Fund on the expiration date as realized gains from options
written. The difference between the premium received and the amount paid on
effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium received is less than the
amount paid for the closing purchase transaction, as a realized loss. If a call
option is exercised, the premium received is added to the proceeds from the
sale of the underlying security or currency in determining whether the Fund has
realized a gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium received
reduces the cost basis of the security or currency purchased by the Fund. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security or currency underlying the written option. Exercise
of an option written by the Fund could result in the Fund selling or buying a
security or currency at a price different from the current market value.

Transactions in written options for the six months ended September 30, 2004,
were as follows:

                                                   Number of        Premiums

2. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of


_______________________________________________________________________________

ALLIANCE WORLD DOLLAR GOVERNMENT FUND II o 19


                                                  Notes to Financial Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment to be received
by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the contract.
Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a
swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may
arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the
underlying securities.

The Fund accrues for the interim payments on swap contracts on a daily basis,
with the net amount recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of
swap contracts on the statement of assets and liabilities. Once the interim
payments are settled in cash, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss
on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss recorded upon the termination of
swap contracts on the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the value of
swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/ depreciation of investments.

The Fund may enter into credit default swaps. The Fund may purchase credit
protection on the referenced obligation of the credit default swap ("Buy
Contract") or provide credit protection on the referenced obligation of the
credit default swap ("Sale Contract"). A sale/(buy) in a credit default swap
provides upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined in the swap
agreement, for the Fund to buy/(sell) from/(to) the counterparty at the
notional amount (the "Notional Amount") and receive/(deliver) the principal
amount of the referenced obligation. If a credit event occurs, the maximum
payout amount for a Sale Contract is limited to the Notional Amount of the swap
contract ("Maximum Payout Amount"). During the term of the swap agreement, the
Fund receives/(pays) semi-annual fixed payments from/(to) the respective
counterparty, calculated at the agreed upon interest rate applied to the
Notional Amount. These interim payments are recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities.

Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested in
the referenced obligation directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general
market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the Fund is
a buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its investment. In addition,
if the Fund is a seller and a credit event occurs, the value of the referenced
obligation received by the Fund coupled with the periodic payments previously
received, may be less than the Maximum Payout Amount it pays to the buyer,
resulting in a loss to the Fund.

At September 30, 2004, the Fund had Sale Contracts outstanding with Maximum
Payout Amounts aggregating $56,840,000, with net unrealized appreciation of
$6,410,585 and terms ranging from 1 to 10 years, as reflected in the portfolio
of investments.

In certain circumstances, the Fund may hold Sale Contracts on the same
referenced obligation and with the same counterparty it has purchased credit
protect-

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tion, which may reduce its obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts, if a
credit event occurs. The Fund had Buy Contracts outstanding with a Notional
Amount of $4,070,000 with respect to the same referenced obligations and same
counterparties of certain Sale Contracts outstanding, which reduced its
obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts to $52,770,000 as of September
30, 2004.

3. Reverse Repurchase Agreements

Under a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells securities and agrees to
repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date and price. At the time the Fund
enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will establish a segregated
account with the custodian containing liquid assets having a value at least
equal to the repurchase price.

For the six months ended September 30, 2004, the average amount of reverse
repurchase agreements outstanding was $43,130,177 and the daily weighted
average interest rate was .33%.

NOTE D

Capital Stock

There are 100,000,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock authorized. Of the
67,648,715 shares outstanding at September 30, 2004, the Adviser owned 7,200
shares. During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Fund repurchased 10,201,653
shares of its outstanding common stock for $13.02 per share pursuant to a
tender offer. The Fund incurred tender offering costs of $66,049 which were
charged to additional paid-in capital. During the six months ended September
30, 2004 and the year ended March 31, 2004, the Fund issued no shares in
connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

NOTE E

Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Concentration of Risk--Investing in securities of foreign companies or foreign
governments involves special risks which include changes in foreign exchange
rates and the possibility of future political and economic developments which

ALLIANCE WORLD DOLLAR GOVERNMENT FUND II o 21


                                                  Notes to Financial Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

could adversely affect the value of such securities. Moreover, securities of
many foreign companies or foreign governments and their markets may be less
liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable United States
companies or of the United States government.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE F

Distributions to Shareholders

The tax character of distributions to be paid for the year ending March 31,
2005 will be determined at the end of the current fiscal year. The tax
character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004
and March 31, 2003 were as follows:

                                                 2004             2003

Total distributions paid                     $  87,373,144    $  82,323,739

As of March 31, 2004, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a tax
basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income                                 $   2,695,800
Accumulated capital and other losses                           (127,414,167)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                          133,560,278(b)
                                                              -------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                          $   8,841,911
                                                              =============

(a)  On March 31, 2004, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$127,414,167 of which $68,891,646 expires in the year 2010 and $58,522,521
expires in the year 2011. To the extent future capital gains are offset by
capital loss carryforwards, such gains will not be distributed. During the
fiscal year, the fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $225,624,007.

(b)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of
losses on wash sales, the difference between book and tax amortization methods
for premium and the difference between book  and tax treatment of swap income.

Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified

as "market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to
cooperate with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not
redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by
the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the
market timing and late trading practices that are the subject of the
investigations mentioned above or the lawsuits described below. Please see
below for a description of the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC
and NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The
lawsuits are now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferring and centralizing all of the mutual funds involving
market and late trading in the District of Maryland. Management of the Adviser
believes that these private lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuance dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAG Order"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

(i)  The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the "Reimbursement
Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse effects of market
timing attributable to market timing relationships described in the SEC Order.
According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be paid, in order of
priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share of losses suffered
by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate share of advisory
fees paid by such fund during the period of such market timing;

(ii)  The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some of
the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January 1,
2004, for a period of at least five years; and

(iii)  The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and compliance
procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adviser's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

The Adviser and approximately twelve other investment management firms were
publicly mentioned in connection with the settlement by the SEC of charges that
an unaffiliated broker/dealer violated federal securities laws relating to its
receipt of compensation for selling specific mutual funds and the disclosure of
such compensation. The SEC has indicated publicly that, among other things, it
is considering enforcement action in connection with mutual funds' disclosure
of such arrangements and in connection with the practice of considering mutual
fund sales in the direction of brokerage commissions from fund portfolio
transactions. The SEC has issued subpoenas to the Adviser in connection with
this matter and the Adviser has provided documents and other information to the
SEC and is cooperating fully with its investigation.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal
defendants. The Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York by an alleged shareholder of an
AllianceBernstein mutual fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other
things, (i) that certain of the defendants improperly authorized the payment of
excessive commissions and other fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in
exchange for preferential marketing services, (ii) that certain of the
defendants misrepresented and omitted from registration statements and other
reports material facts concerning such payments, and (iii) that certain
defendants caused such conduct as control persons of other defendants. The
Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and
48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206 and 215 of the Advisers Act,
breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding and abetting breaches of
common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of
compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of their contracts with
the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the Adviser pursuant to
such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees, commissions and soft
dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or discriminatorily obtained
fees and expenses.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since June 22, 2004, numerous additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants, and others may be filed.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.

                                                           Financial Highlights
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a)  As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however prior to
April 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. The effect of this change for
the year ended March 31, 2004, was to decrease net investment income per share
by $0.06 and increase net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment
transactions per share by $0.06, and decrease the ratios of net investment
income and expenses to average net assets by 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively.

(b)  As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund has adopted the provisions
of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, and
began amortizing premium on debt securities for financial statement reporting
purposes only. The effect of this change for the year ended March 31, 2002 was
to decrease net investment income per share by $.01, increase net realized and
unrealized gain on investments per share by $.01, and decrease the ratio of net
investment income to average net assets from 12.74% to 12.69%. Per share,
ratios and supplemental data for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been
restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(c)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed, for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to
the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of
such periods. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one
year is not annualized.

(e)  Annualized.

                  CERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER

I, Marc O. Mayer, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR (the "Report") of Alliance World
     Dollar Government Fund II, Inc. (the "Fund");

2.   Based on my knowledge, this Report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     Report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this Report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the Fund as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this Report;

4.   The Fund's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing
     and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
     30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the Fund and have:

         a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
              supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
              Fund, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
              by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
              which this Report is being prepared;

         b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the Fund's disclosure controls and
              procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
              effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
              date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Report based
              on such evaluation; and

         c)   disclosed in this Report any change in the Fund's internal control
              over financial reporting that occurred during the Fund's most
              recent fiscal half-year [or second fiscal half-year in the case of
              an annual report] that has materially affected, or is reasonably
              likely to materially affect, the Fund's internal control over
              financial reporting; and

5.   The Fund's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the Fund's
     auditors and the audit committee of the Fund's board of directors:

         a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
              internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
              likely to adversely affect the Fund's ability to record, process,
              summarize, and report financial information; and

         b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
              other employees who have a significant role in the Fund's internal
              controls.
