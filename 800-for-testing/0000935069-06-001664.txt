            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

In our opinion, the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital,  including the schedule of investments,  and the related  statements of
operations,  of changes in members'  capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of
Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund,  LLC (the "Fund") at March 31,
2006, and the results of its  operations,  the changes in its members'  capital,
its cash  flows and the  financial  highlights  for the  periods  indicated,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial  statements") are the  responsibility of the Fund's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  of these  financial  statements  in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  investments  at  March  31,  2006 by
correspondence  with the  custodian and  portfolio  funds,  provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by the
Fund  valued at  $170,361,661  (94.10% of the Fund's net  assets),  at March 31,
2006, the values of which have been fair valued by the Investment  Manager based
on estimates  provided by each portfolio fund, under the general  supervision of
the Board of Directors,  in the absence of readily  ascertainable market values.
These estimated values may differ  significantly from the values that would have
been used had a ready market for the  investments  existed,  and the differences
could be material.

The below ratios are  calculated  by dividing  total dollars of income or expenses as applicable by the average of total annual
members' capital. Total return amounts are calculated by geometrically linking returns based on the change in value during each
accounting period. An individual  member's return may vary from these returns based on the timing of capital  contributions and
withdrawals.

1. ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
investment  company and which has many of the  features of a private  investment
fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests") are offered only in private placements
to persons (i) who are both  "accredited  investors" under the Securities Act of
1933 and  "qualified  clients"  under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as
amended and (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the
Fund. The primary investment  objective of the Fund is to provide investors with
an  attractive,  long-term  rate  of  return,  on  an  absolute  as  well  as  a
risk-adjusted  basis,  with low performance  volatility and minimal  correlation
with the equity and fixed income  markets.  The Fund's strategy is to (i) invest
in approximately  25-50 partnerships and other investment  vehicles  ("Portfolio
Funds") managed by different  investment managers and (ii) construct a portfolio
employing  various  arbitrage and equity  strategies to achieve the risk control
benefits  of  diversification  together  with the  value of a hedged  investment
approach.

Effective  December  4,  2004,  Banc  of  America  Investment   Advisors,   Inc.
("Adviser") is the SEC registered investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser is
an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Bank of America  Corporation  ("BAC").
Prior to December 4, 2004, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("CMA"), which has
merged into Columbia Management Advisors, LLC, was the investment adviser to the
Fund.  CMA is an affiliate of the  Adviser.  The Adviser has retained  Grosvenor
Capital Management,  L.P. ("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as subadviser to the
Fund. The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have been  designated as special  members
(the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The  Fund's  investments  are  fair  valued  by the  Adviser  or  Subadviser  in
accordance  with  policies and  procedures  that seek to ensure that the Fund is
able to reliably  determine the value of its investments in the Portfolio Funds.
Investments in Portfolio  Funds are generally  valued at net asset value,  which
approximates  fair  value,  as  reported  by the  administrators  or  investment
managers of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such values  generally  represent the Fund's
proportionate share of the net assets of the Portfolio Funds.  Accordingly,  the
value of  investments  in Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are initially  valued at cost,  with  subsequent  adjustments  to values,  which
reflect either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C. INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E. CASH

At March 31,  2006,  a total of  $3,781,362  in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust Company,  the Fund's custodian.  Of that amount,  $1,539,918 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

3. MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2005 and December 31, 2005. The interests  redeemed pursuant to such tenders are
shown in the Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

4. INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

Aggregate  purchases  of  Portfolio  Funds for the year  ended  March 31,  2006,
amounted to  $27,925,326,  including  $5,600,000 in purchases of Portfolio Funds
paid in advance of Portfolio Fund  openings.  Portfolio  Fund  investments  sold
during the year ended March 31, 2006 amounted to $46,762,488.

5. MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if  its  Interest  as of  the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter  and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive  Period.  The Hurdle
Rate Amount for June 30, 2005,  September 30, 2005,  December 31, 2005 and March
31, 2006 is 3.403%, 3.636%, 4.153% and 4.424% per annum,  respectively.  On June
30, 2005 and  December 31, 2005,  incentive  allocations  of $1,689 and $497,639
were  realized,  respectively.  Additional  capital of $572,438  would have been
reallocable  to the Special  Members  had the  Members'  measurement  period for
incentive allocation closed on March 31, 2006.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution, and
the Member's  opening capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the
beginning of such Incentive Period,  will be allocated between the two Interests
in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that is  repurchased  or
distributed.

7. ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC")  (also an affiliate  of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain accounting,  record keeping, and investor related services. The
Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the  administrator  based primarily
upon month-end Members' capital, subject to a monthly minimum fee.

Effective  January 1, 2005,  the Fund has entered into an agreement with PFPC to
perform regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays PFPC .015% per year of
average net assets  subject to a minimum fee. For the year ended March 31, 2006,
the  Fund  expensed  $28,862,  which  is  recorded  in  Other  expenses  in  the
accompanying Statement of Operations.

8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each manager who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund,  as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for each
meeting attended.  Any manager or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund.  All managers are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

9. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
   RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only  invested  in  such  limited  partnership  and  limited  liability  company
interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Investors and will not be exchangeable for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have  limited
liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund  significant  repurchases.  Members
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

10. LITIGATION EVENT

The  events  described  below  have not  directly  impacted  the Fund or had any
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in connection  with matters  related to late trading
and market timing of mutual funds advised and  distributed  by affiliates of the
Adviser. The SEC Orders and the NYAG Settlements contain  substantially the same
terms and conditions  outlined in the agreements in principle that affiliates of
the Adviser  entered into with the SEC and NYAG in March 2004. A copy of the SEC
Orders is available on the SEC website at HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV. A copy of the NYAG
settlements  is  available as part of the Bank of America  Corporation  Form 8-K
filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with these  matters,  various  parties  have filed suit  against
certain  Columbia Funds,  including  former Nations Funds, the Trustees of these
Funds,  FleetBoston Financial Corporation (the former parent of the Adviser) and
its affiliated  entities  and/or Bank of America  Corporation and its affiliated
entities.   More  than  300  cases,   including  those  filed  against  entities
unaffiliated  with the  Columbia  Funds,  their  Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial
Corporation and its affiliated  entities and/or Bank of America  Corporation and
its affiliated entities,  have been transferred to the Federal District Court in
Maryland and consolidated in a multi-district proceeding.  Other actions against
certain of the Columbia Funds, advisers and affiliated entities,  alleging among
other  things  excessive  fees  and   inappropriate   use  of  fund  assets  for
distribution, have been consolidated in the Massachusetts federal court as IN RE
COLUMBIA ENTITIES LITIGATION on March 2, 2005. These actions are ongoing.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

     (a)  The  registrant,  as of the end of the period  covered by this report,
          has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to  the  registrant's
          principal executive officer,  principal  financial officer,  principal
          accounting  officer  or  controller,  or  persons  performing  similar
          functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the
          registrant or a third party.

     (c)  The  registrant's  Board of Directors  adopted,  effective  January 3,
          2006,  a revised code of ethics  described in 2(a) above.  The revised
          code of  ethics,  which is  attached  as an exhibit  hereto,  does not
          differ materially from the code of ethics in effect for the year ended
          March 31, 2005.

     (d)  The  registrant  has not granted any  waivers,  including  an implicit
          waiver,  from a provision  of the code of ethics  that  applies to the
          registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
          principal  accounting  officer or  controller,  or persons  performing

  (e)(1)       Audit Committee Pre-approval Policies and Procedures.
               -----------------------------------------------------

               The  registrant's  Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the
          engagement  of the  registrant's  independent  accountants  to provide
          audit  and  permissible  non-audit  services  to  the  registrant  and
          non-audit  services  to its  investment  adviser  (not  including  any
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another  investment  adviser) or any
          entity  controlling,  controlled by or under common  control with such
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          ("Adviser  Affiliates"),  if the  engagement  relates  directly to the
          operations or financial reporting of the registrant.

               The Audit  Committee  has  adopted  a Policy  for  Engagement  of
          Independent  Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit Services  ("Policy").
          The  Policy  sets  forth  the  understanding  of the  Audit  Committee
          regarding the engagement of the registrant's  independent  accountants
          to  provide  (i) audit and  permissible  audit-related,  tax and other
          services  to  the  registrant  (collectively  "Fund  Services");  (ii)
          non-audit  services  to  the  registrant's   investment  adviser  (not
          including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management
          and is subcontracted with or overseen by another  investment  adviser)
          and Adviser Affiliates, if the engagement relates

<PAGE>

          directly  to  the   operations  or  financial   reporting  of  a  Fund
          (collectively  "Fund-related  Adviser  Services");  and (iii)  certain
          other  audit and  non-audit  services to the  registrant's  investment
          adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily
          portfolio  management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
          investment adviser) and Adviser  Affiliates.  Unless a type of service
          receives general  pre-approval  under the Policy, it requires specific
          pre-approval  by the Audit  Committee  if it is to be  provided by the
          independent  accountants.  Pre-approval  of non-audit  services to the
          registrant,  the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not including any
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          subcontracted  with or overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  and
          Adviser  Affiliates  may be  waived  provided  that  the "de  minimis"
          requirements  set forth under  paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of
          Regulation S-X are met.

               Under the Policy,  the Audit Committee may delegate  pre-approval
          authority to any pre-designated  member or members who are independent
          directors.  The  member(s) to whom such  authority  is delegated  must
          report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to
          the Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. The Audit Committee's
          responsibilities   with  respect  to  the   pre-approval  of  services
          performed  by the  independent  accountants  may not be  delegated  to
          management.

               The Policy  requires the Fund Treasurer or his or her designee to
          submit to the Audit  Committee,  on an annual basis, a schedule of the
          types of  services  that are  subject  to  general  pre-approval.  The
          schedule(s)  provide a  description  of each type of  service  that is
          subject to general  pre-approval  and,  where  possible,  will provide
          estimated  fee caps for each instance of providing  each service.  The
          Audit  Committee  will review and  approve  the types of services  and
          review the projected  fees for the next fiscal year and may add to, or
          subtract from, the list of general pre-approved  services from time to
          time based on subsequent  determinations.  That approval  acknowledges
          that the Audit  Committee is in agreement  with the specific  types of
          services  that  the  independent  accountants  will  be  permitted  to
          perform. The Fund Treasurer or his or her designee must update the fee
          amounts to the extent  necessary  at each of the  regularly  scheduled
          meetings of the Audit Committee.

               If the registrant,  any Adviser  Affiliate or a Control Affiliate
          wishes to engage  the  registrant's  independent  account to perform a
          service  that has not  received  general  pre-approval  but for  which
          pre-approval  is  required,  management  must  prepare a  request  for
          approval  and the matter  must be  included  in the agenda of the next
          regularly  scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee.  If a more timely
          consideration of the matter is required,  the Chairperson of the Audit
          Committee  may take action on the matter or call a special  meeting of
          the Audit Committee to consider the proposal.

   (e)(2) The  percentage  of services  described in  paragraphs (b) through (d)
          of this Item  approved  pursuant to the "de minimis"  exception  under
          paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C)  of Rule 2-01 of  Regulation  S-X  during  the
          fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005 was zero.

     (f)  Not applicable.

     (g)  During the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  2005 and March 31,  2006,
          respectively,  aggregate non-audit fees of approximately $24.9 million
          and $25.1 million were billed by the Registrant's principal accountant
          to the  Registrant's  investment  adviser (not including a sub-adviser
          whose role is primarily portfolio  management and is sub-contracted or
          overseen by another investment
<PAGE>

          adviser) and any entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common
          control with the investment  adviser,  including entities that provide
          ongoing services to the Registrant.

     (h)  The Registrant's  audit committee  considered whether the provision of
          non-audit  services  rendered to the Registrant's  investment  adviser
          (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose role is  primarily  portfolio
          management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
          adviser),  and any entity controlling,  controlled by, or under common
          control with the investment  adviser that provides ongoing services to
          the  Registrant   that  were  not   pre-approved  is  compatible  with
          maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the close of
the  reporting  period is included as part of the report to  shareholders  filed
under Item 1 of this form.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The   registrant   has   delegated  to  Grosvenor   Capital   Management,   L.P.
("Grosvenor"),  its sub-adviser,  the responsibility to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, requires an
SEC-registered  investment  adviser like  Grosvenor  to  implement  proxy voting
policies and procedures  reasonably designed to ensure that they vote proxies in
the best  interests  of their  clients.  Pursuant  to that rule,  Grosvenor  has
adopted Proxy Voting  Policies and Procedures  (the "Proxy  Policies") that have
been designed to ensure that  Grosvenor  votes proxies in the best  interests of
the various  investment  funds or  accounts  that  Grosvenor  manages or advises
(each, a "GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNT").

WHEN GROSVENOR IS REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO PROXY REQUESTS

Each Grosvenor-Managed  Account is either: (i) a "fund of funds" that invests in
underlying  investment funds ("PORTFOLIO FUNDS") but does not invest directly in
securities of operating  companies  except on a limited basis or (ii) a "feeder"
fund that invests in such a "fund of funds."

As a result, the most common scenario in which Grosvenor is requested to respond
to proxy requests  relating to securities held by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts is where Grosvenor is requested to vote limited partnership  interests,
limited  liability  company  interests,  shares or similar  equity  interests in
Portfolio Funds in which one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts invest. In rare
cases,  Grosvenor  is requested to vote on matters  relating to  investments  in
operating companies.

For  purposes  of  convenience,  each  request  to  vote a  security  held  by a
Grosvenor-Managed Account is referred to as a "PROXY REQUEST."

MATERIAL PROPOSALS AND IMMATERIAL PROPOSALS

<PAGE>

Grosvenor divides Proxy Requests into two general categories,  those relating to
"Immaterial Proposals" and those relating to "Material Proposals."

An  "IMMATERIAL  PROPOSAL"  is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD NOT, in the
reasonable judgment of a Grosvenor Compliance Officer,  either: (a) be likely to
have a material  adverse  affect on the  relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)
(E.G.,  a  proposal  to  approve a change in the name of a  Portfolio  Fund,  to
approve a Portfolio  Fund's previous  year's audited  financial  statements,  to
approve a Portfolio  Fund's  appointment of independent  auditors,  to elect new
directors of a Portfolio Fund); or (b) materially  adversely change the terms on
which future investments may be made by one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

A  "MATERIAL  PROPOSAL,"  I.E.,  a proposal  that,  if  adopted,  WOULD,  in the
reasonable judgment of a Grosvenor Compliance Officer,  either: (a) be likely to
have a material adverse affect on the relevant Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s); or
(b) materially  adversely  change the terms on which future  investments  may be
made by one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST

It is Grosvenor's  policy to act on each Proxy Request relating to an Immaterial
Proposal in accordance  with such request  (unless  Grosvenor's  Chief Operating
Officer determines otherwise). Except as provided in the following paragraph and
as discussed  below under  "MANAGING  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST," it is  Grosvenor's
policy  to  act on  each  Proxy  Request  relating  to a  Material  Proposal  in
accordance  with the  recommendation  of the Grosvenor  employee who has primary
investment  authority  with respect to the  securities in question (the "PRIMARY
INVESTMENT  PRINCIPAL"),  as long as such action  would be  consistent  with the
investment   objective(s),   policies   and   restrictions   of   the   relevant
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  any member of Grosvenor's  Investment  Committee
may object to the recommendation of a Primary  Investment  Principal in response
to a Proxy  Request.  In the case of any such  objection,  the  matter  shall be
referred  to the  Investment  Committee,  whose  decision  shall  be  final  and
conclusive;  provided,  however,  that the Chief Executive  Officer or the Chief
Operating  Officer  may  veto any  action  proposed  to be  taken  by a  Primary
Investment  Principal  or by the  Investment  Committee  in  response to a Proxy
Request.

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING  WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE  TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST

Grosvenor  expects that Proxy  Requests  frequently  will  request  Grosvenor to
approve measures that reduce the rights,  powers and authority,  and/or increase
the duties and obligations,  associated with the security in question  ("ADVERSE
MEASURES").  For example,  it is anticipated that Proxy Requests frequently will
request  Grosvenor to approve  increased  fees and/or less  favorable  liquidity
provisions relating to Portfolio Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest.

Nevertheless, it is expected that a Primary Investment Principal ordinarily will
recommend  favorable  action on Proxy Requests that propose Adverse  Measures as
long as such Primary Investment Principal reasonably believes that continuing to
hold the relevant security has a reasonable  probability of conferring  benefits
on the  relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (e.g.,  continued  access  to a
high-quality  Portfolio  Manager)  that  outweigh the adverse  affect(s) of such
Adverse Measure, considered

<PAGE>

over  the  anticipated  holding  period  of such  security  in the  hands of the
relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).

MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In  furtherance  of  Grosvenor's  goal to take action on all Proxy Requests in a
manner  that  best  serves  the  interests  of  the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  Grosvenor  will not  implement  any  decision  to  respond to a Proxy
Request in a particular manner unless and until a Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer
has implemented certain procedures to: (i) identify whether Grosvenor is subject
to a conflict of interest  in taking  action in response to such Proxy  Request;
(ii) assess the  materiality  of such a conflict;  and (iii)  address a material
conflict  in a manner  designed  to serve  the best  interests  of the  affected
Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s).  A  conflict  of  interest  ordinarily  will  be
considered material if it can reasonably be argued that Grosvenor (or certain of
its  related  persons)  has an  incentive  to respond to the Proxy  Request in a
manner  designed to benefit  Grosvenor (or any such related  person) rather than
the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (even if  there  is no  ostensible
detriment to the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s) from responding to such
request  in  that  manner).  All  materiality  determinations  are  based  on an
assessment of the particular facts and circumstances.

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of  interest in taking  action in response to a
Proxy Request but that such  conflict is not material,  he or she shall issue an
instruction  to take action in response to such Proxy Request as provided  above
under "DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is  subject  to a material  conflict  of  interest  in taking  action in
response to a Proxy Request,  he or she shall, in  consultation  with such other
Grosvenor  personnel  as he  or  she  determines  to be  appropriate  under  the
circumstances,  determine how to address such conflict.  In  determining  how to
address a material conflict of interest,  the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer may
consider the following potential solutions, as well as any other solutions he or
she wishes to consider:

o    disclosing the conflict of interest to the  participant(s)  in the relevant
     Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  and obtaining  their consent (in  accordance
     with the  governing  documents of such Account) to act on the Proxy Request
     as provided  above  under  "DETERMINING  WHAT  ACTION  SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH
     RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."

o    engaging an  independent  third party to  recommend a response to the Proxy
     Request.

The Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer shall not issue an instruction to take action
in response to the Proxy Request without first  determining  that such action is
in the best interests of the affected Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).

     COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE.  Mr.  Sacks  and  the  members  of the  Investment
Committee each receive a fixed base salary as well as an annual bonus based upon
the success of the firm. In addition, each holds an equity participation,  which
entitles him to distributions. Compensation is not based upon the performance or
net asset  value of the  Registrant  or any of the  other  accounts  managed  by
Grosvenor.

     OWNERSHIP  BY  PORTFOLIO  MANAGERS.  As of  March  31,  2006,  none  of the
individuals at Grosvenor responsible for the day-to-day investment management of
the Registrant owns any interests in the Registrant.

     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  Grosvenor  is subject to  significant  conflicts of
interest in managing the business  and affairs of the  Registrant  and the other
pooled   investment   vehicles   and   other   accounts    (collectively,    the
"Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts") and in making investment decisions for them. Such
conflicts  could affect the  objectivity of Grosvenor and the performance of the
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts.    Grosvenor   has   fiduciary   duties   to   the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  to act in good faith and with  fairness  in all its
dealings  with them,  and will take such duties into account in dealing with all
actual and potential conflicts of interest.

     Grosvenor and its related persons are currently involved in, and may in the
future become involved in, other business ventures, including: (i) investing in,
entering into fee-, revenue- or profit sharing agreements with, operating and/or
managing other  investment  management or investment  advisory  firms;  and (ii)
managing  and/or  administering  investment  funds and  accounts  in addition to
existing Grosvenor- Managed Accounts.  The  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will not
share in the risks or  rewards  of such  other  ventures.  Further,  such  other
ventures will both compete with the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts for the time and
attention of Grosvenor and its related persons and potentially create additional
conflicts of interest or raise other special  considerations.  Grosvenor and its
related  persons,  in  investing  and  trading  for  accounts  (including  their
proprietary accounts) other than the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, may make use of
information   obtained   by   them  in  the   course   of   investing   for  the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  will have no
obligation to compensate any Grosvenor-Managed  Account in any respect for their
receipt of such information or to account to any  Grosvenor-Managed  Account for
any profits earned from their use of such information.

     Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  currently  manage or advise  numerous
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts,   and  expect  to  manage  or  advise   additional
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  in the  future.  Certain  of the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  have  or  will  have  investment  objectives  that  are  identical  or
substantially  similar to those of other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts. It is not
anticipated,  however,  that  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  having  identical  or
substantially similar investment

<PAGE>

objectives will have identical or substantially  similar investment  portfolios.
Differing investment  portfolios can be expected to result from several factors,
including, without limitation, the following:

     o    regulatory   constraints  that  apply  to  certain   Grosvenor-Managed
          Accounts but not to others, as discussed below;

     o    investment constraints imposed by the Investment Managers of Portfolio
          Funds on certain Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not on others;

     o    the  availability  of  particular  Portfolio  Funds for  investment by
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times but not at others; and

     o    the   amount  of  cash   available   for   investment   by   different
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times.

     As a result of factors such as these, a Grosvenor-Managed  Account may have
a  different  investment  portfolio  (and,  as a result,  different  performance
results)   from  other   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   even   though  all  such
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.

     Regulatory constraints may prohibit one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
from participating in investment opportunities that are available to one or more
other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

     The   Investment   Managers   of  the   Portfolio   Funds  in   which   the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts wish to invest may impose investment restrictions on
certain  Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  but  not  on  others.  (For  example,  an
Investment  Manager of a  Portfolio  Fund may  accept  only  limited  amounts of
capital from  participants that are "plan asset" funds within the meaning of the
Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,  but place no such
restrictions on participants that are not "plan asset" funds.) Such restrictions
could render one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  ineligible to invest,  in
whole  or  in  part,   in  a   Portfolio   Fund  in  which  one  or  more  other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are free to invest.

     Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
may place  assets  under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure  investment
advisory or investment management services from, any Investment Manager directly
or  indirectly  used by one or more other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Grosvenor, its related persons and one
or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may invest in, or withdraw investments from,
a  Portfolio  Fund in which one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  are
invested, from which they are withdrawing their investments or in which they are
not invested.

     In  certain  instances,  Grosvenor  may be  required  to  allocate  limited
investment opportunities in Portfolio Funds among Grosvenor, its related persons
and Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Grosvenor has developed policies and procedures
for allocating limited investment  opportunities in a manner that it believes to
be equitable to all Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

     Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
that place  assets under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure  investment
advisory  services from, any Investment  Manager  directly or indirectly used by
one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may do so on

<PAGE>

terms   (including   terms  relating  to  fees  and  liquidity)  that  are  more
advantageous  than  those  applicable  to the  investments  made by  such  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s) with such Investment  Manager.  To the extent that
Grosvenor or its related persons invest with a given Investment Manager on terms
that are more advantageous than those on which Grosvenor-Managed Accounts invest
with such  Investment  Manager,  Grosvenor  and its related  persons may have an
incentive to maintain or increase the investment by  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
with  such   Investment   Manager  in  order  to  obtain  and/or  maintain  such
advantageous terms for the benefit of Grosvenor and its related persons.

     Grosvenor and its related  persons may from time to time invest,  for their
respective  proprietary  accounts, in early-stage Portfolio Funds, at times when
investments   in   such   Portfolio   Funds   are   not   appropriate   for  the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  If Grosvenor  should  subsequently  determine,  in
accordance  with  its  then-current  criteria  applicable  to the  selection  of
Portfolio Funds for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, that a such a Portfolio Fund
is an appropriate investment for the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  Grosvenor and
its related  persons will not be required to restructure the terms on which they
invest in such  Portfolio  Fund in order to make  investments  in such Portfolio
Fund available to those Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that, for regulatory or other
reasons,  are (or, in Grosvenor's  reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded
from investing in such Portfolio Fund in the absence of such restructuring.

     Grosvenor  might have an incentive  to favor one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts over one or more other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (for example,  with
regard to the selection of Portfolio Funds for those Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
or the  allocation  of  investment  opportunities  in Portfolio  Funds that have
limited investment capacity), because the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed Account(s)
might pay  Grosvenor  more for its  services  than such other  Grosvenor-Managed
Account(s).  Similarly,  Grosvenor  may have an  incentive  to favor one or more
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts over one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts if
Grosvenor  or any of its  related  persons  has a  personal  investment  in such
"favored"  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s).  No assurance  can be given that (i) a
particular   Grosvenor-Managed   Account  will  participate  in  all  investment
opportunities in which other client or proprietary accounts of Grosvenor and its
related persons participate,  (ii) particular investment opportunities allocated
to client or  proprietary  accounts of Grosvenor  and its related  persons other
than a  particular  Grosvenor-Managed  Account  will not  outperform  investment
opportunities allocated to such Grosvenor-Managed Account, or (iii) a particular
Grosvenor-Managed  Account, on the one hand, and other similarly-situated client
and  proprietary  accounts of Grosvenor  and its related  persons,  on the other
hand, will receive equal or similar treatment.

     Grosvenor may from time to time arrange for a Grosvenor-Managed Account (an
"ASSIGNOR  ACCOUNT")  to  assign  all  or any  portion  of  its  interest  in an
underlying  Portfolio  Fund to another  Grosvenor-Managed  Account (an "ASSIGNEE
ACCOUNT").  In each such  case,  Grosvenor  will have  determined  to cause such
Assignor  Account to effect a redemption  from such Portfolio Fund, and to cause
such Assignee  Account to invest in such  Portfolio  Fund.  However,  instead of
causing  the  Assignor  Account  to  effect a  redemption  from  the  underlying
Portfolio  Fund and causing the  Assignee  Account to invest in such  underlying
Portfolio  Fund,  the  transaction  may be  effected as an  assignment  from the
Assignor  Account  to  the  Assignee  Account  for  reasons  of   administrative
convenience  and mutual benefit to both Accounts.  Any such  assignment  will be
effected at the  reported net asset value for the relevant  Portfolio  Fund,  as
calculated and reported by the Investment  Manager of such Portfolio Fund. In no
instance will any party,  including  Grosvenor or the Investment  Manager of the
affected Portfolio Fund, receive any additional  compensation  specifically as a
result of any such assignment.

<PAGE>

     Grosvenor may from time to time cause a Grosvenor-Managed Account to invest
(or recommend that a Grosvenor-Managed Account invest) all or any portion of its
assets in another Grosvenor-Managed  Account, provided that such investments are
consistent  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and have been adequately
disclosed to participants in the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts involved,  if such
disclosure  is  material  under  the  particular  facts and  circumstances,  or,
alternatively, if such investments are made on a basis that does not involve the
payment of an additional fee to Grosvenor.

     Different  participants in the same  Grosvenor-Managed  Account, as well as
certain other persons may receive reporting  packages from Grosvenor that differ
in form, substance,  timing and/or frequency.  In particular,  certain reporting
packages  may  include  information  relating  to  Portfolio  Funds in which the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  invest  (or in  which  they  are  contemplating  an
investment).  Grosvenor  ordinarily does not place restrictions on a recipient's
use of such  information,  and a recipient could use such  information to invest
directly in Portfolio Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts invest (or
in which they are contemplating an investment),  potentially in competition with
the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.


ITEM 9. PURCHASES  OF  EQUITY  SECURITIES BY  CLOSED-END  MANAGEMENT  INVESTMENT
        COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not applicable.


ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material  changes to the procedures by which the shareholders
may  recommend  nominees to the  registrant's  board of  directors,  where those
changes were  implemented  after the  registrant  last  provided  disclosure  in
response to the  requirements  of Item  7(d)(2)(ii)(G)  of Schedule  14A (17 CFR
240.14a-101), or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's  principal  executive officer and principal financial
          officers,  based on their  evaluation of the  registrant's  disclosure
          controls and  procedures  as of a date within 90 days of the filing of
          this report,  have  concluded  that such controls and  procedures  are
          adequately  designed  to  ensure  that  information   required  to  be
          disclosed  by  the  registrant  in  Form  N-CSR  is  accumulated   and
          communicated to the registrant's  management,  including the principal
          executive  officer  and  principal   financial  officer,   or  persons
          performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
          regarding required disclosure.


     (b)  There  were no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
          financial  reporting (as defined in Rule  30a-3(d)  under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

     (a)(1)   Code of ethics,  or any amendment thereto,  that is the subject of
              disclosure required by Item 2 is attached hereto.

                                Item 2 of Form N-CSR

- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT
- ----------------------

Item 2 of Form N-CSR, the form used by registered management investment
companies to file certified shareholder reports, requires a registered
management investment company to disclose (1) whether it has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to the investment company's principal executive officer and
senior financial officers and, if it has not adopted such a code of ethics, why
it has not done so, and (2) any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of
ethics relating to such officers.

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following Code of Ethics, which sets
forth the ethical standards to which the Fund holds its principal executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

FUND LEVEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
- ----------------------------------

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This Code of Ethics (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer or
Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in
          other public communications made by the Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
<PAGE>

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or apparent
conflicts of interest.

II. ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

     The Board has designated an individual to be primarily responsible for the
administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). In the absence of the Code
Officer, his or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
temporary basis.

     The Board has designated a person who meets the definition of a chief legal
officer (the "CLO") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
promulgated thereunder as the Fund's CLO. The CLO of the Fund shall assist the
Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Code Officer, in
consultation with the CLO, shall be responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations (in consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and
has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.

III. MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's personal
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

     Certain provisions in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Advisers Act and the rules and regulations thereunder govern certain
conflicts of interest that arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and its Adviser's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and conduct that is consistent
with such programs and procedures falls outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationships between the Fund and, as applicable, its Adviser, administrator,
principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
(each, a "Primary Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes

<PAGE>

that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for a Primary Service Provider, or for both), be
involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the Primary Service Providers and the Fund. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationships between the Fund and the Primary Service Providers and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of
the Fund that the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or
more other investment companies or organizations affiliated with the sponsor of
the Fund covered by other similar codes and that the codes of ethics of those
other investment companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers
acting in such capacities for such other investment companies.

     This Code covers conflicts of interest that are not subject to provisions
in the 1940 Act and Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such conflicts of interest follow.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    not knowingly use his or her personal influence or personal
          relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or
          financial reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     o    not knowingly cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,
          for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, rather than the benefit of the Fund;

     o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
          or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to
          trade personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
          transactions; and

     o    report at least annually (or more frequently, as appropriate) known
          affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of
          interest with respect to the Fund.

     If a Covered Officer believes that he or she has a potential conflict of
interest that is likely to materially compromise his or her objectivity or his
or her ability to perform the duties of his or her role as a Covered Officer,
including a potential conflict of interest that arises out of his or her
responsibilities as an officer or employee of one or more Primary Service
Providers or other funds, he or she should consult with the Code Officer, the
CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent Board Members, as
appropriate.

<PAGE>

     Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially compromise
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer and which the
Covered Officer should consider discussing with the Code Officer or other
appropriate person include:

     o    service as a director on the board of a public or private company or
          service as a public official;

     o    the receipt of a non-de minimis gift when the gift is in relation to
          doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

     o    the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Fund has
          current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is
          business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
          place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

     o    an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
          with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the Primary
          Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
          transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
          portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than
          an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

IV.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

     o    to familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
          generally applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and
          financial operations of the Fund;

     o    to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others to
          misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board, legal counsel, legal
          counsel to the Independent Board Members and auditors, and to
          governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility,
          consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the Primary
          Service Providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
          timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
          Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
          communications made by the Fund; and
<PAGE>

     o    to adhere to and, within his or her area of responsibility, promote
          compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

V.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer, acknowledge
          in writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has received, read and
          understands the Code, using the form attached as Appendix I hereto;

     o    annually thereafter acknowledge in writing to the Fund's Board that he
          or she has received and read the Code and believes that he or she has
          complied with the requirements of the Code, using the form attached as
          Appendix II hereto;

     o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify the Code Officer promptly if he or she knows of any violation,
          or of conduct that reasonably could be expected to be or result in a
          violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

     The Fund will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

     o    The Code Officer will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
          investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

     o    If, after such investigation, the Code Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Code Officer will so notify the person(s)
          reporting the potential violation, and no further action is required;

     o    Any matter that the Code Officer, upon consultation with the CLO,
          believes is a violation will be reported by the Code Officer or the
          CLO to the Fund's Audit Committee;

     o    If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
          inform and make a recommendation to the Fund's Board, which will
          consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
          appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to the appropriate personnel of the Fund's Primary
          Service Providers or their boards; a recommendation to censure,
          suspend or dismiss the Covered Officer; or referral of the matter to
          the appropriate authorities for civil action or criminal prosecution;
<PAGE>

     o    The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers,
          as appropriate; and

     o    This Code and any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the
          extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit Committee quarterly any
violations of, or material issues arising under, this Code.

VI.  OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for the
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered management investment companies thereunder. Insofar as
other polices or procedures of the Fund or the Fund's Primary Service Providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent
that they conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Fund's and its
Adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
1940 Act and the more detailed policies and procedures of the Primary Service
Providers as set forth in their respect Compliance Manuals are separate
requirements applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

ratified by the Fund's Board, including a majority of the Independent Board
Members.

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code or upon advice of counsel, such
reports and records shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's
Board, the Covered Officers, the Code Officer, the CLO, the Fund's Primary
Service Providers and their affiliates, and outside audit firms, legal counsel
to the Fund and legal counsel to the Independent Board Members and to the
Primary Service Providers and their affiliates.

IX.  RECORDKEEPING

     The Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an easily
accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the Audit
Committee or the Board: (i) that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver
to this Code; and (ii) relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions
imposed for such violation, together with a written record of the approval or
action taken by the Audit Committee and/or Board.

         The CLO is responsible for maintaining (i) a current list of the Fund's
Covered

<PAGE>

Officers and (ii) records of all activities related to this Policy, including
those records required to be maintained by the Fund pursuant to the preceding
paragraph.


X.   INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

for administration of this Policy and for adopting specific procedures to ensure
