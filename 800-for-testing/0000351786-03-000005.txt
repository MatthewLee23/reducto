1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company") is a closed-end, diversified investment
      company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
      Prior to becoming a regulated investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
      Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary
      of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the
      preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity
      with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies.

      A.    Investment Valuations - The investment securities are stated at
            market value as determined by closing prices on national securities
            exchanges. Investment securities include corporate bonds, government
            agency bonds, mutual funds, common and preferred stocks, and other
            investments, including limited partnerships and venture capital.

            The carrying value of the investments in wholly owned subsidiaries
            is based on an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the
            subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of the wholly owned subsidiaries in
            the statement of operations represents the current year earnings of
            the subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method.

            The carrying value of the investment in real estate is based on an
            independent appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate.

      B.    Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for
            on the date the order to buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
            losses on investments are determined on the basis of specific
            identification of issues sold or matured.

      C.    Income Taxes - No federal tax provision is required as it is the
            Company's policy to comply with the provisions of Subchapter M of
            the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the
            distribution to its shareholders of substantially all of its income
            and any capital gains not offset by capital losses. Also, no state
            income tax provision has been provided because the states in which
            the Company has income recognize the tax exempt status of a
            regulated investment company.

      D.    Dividend Policy - It is the Company's policy to pay dividends during
            the year in sufficient amounts to meet the requirements to maintain
            its status as a regulated investment company.

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

      E.    Temporary Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of
            financial reporting, the Company considers all investments at
            financial institutions with original maturities of three months or
            less (repurchase agreements at April 30, 2003) to be equivalent to
            cash. Short-term money market investments managed by third party
            investors are included in investment securities.

      F.    Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States of America requires management to make estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
            liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
            revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
            could differ from those estimates.

2.    LINE OF CREDIT

      On August 24, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for
      a line of credit in the amount of $10,000,000 to provide the Company more
      flexibility in its payment of dividends and management of its investments.
      The interest rate on any borrowings will be at the LIBOR market index rate
      plus 125 basis points. No commitment fee is charged on any unused balance.
      As of April 30, 2003, the Company had borrowings of $10,000,000 from this
      line of credit.

3.    ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS

      The Company does not have an advisory board. The independent directors are
      paid an annual fee of $3,000 plus $1,000 for each meeting attended. Each
      such independent director is paid an additional $1,000 for each day
      attending a committee meeting not held in conjunction with a board
      meeting. In addition, all directors are reimbursed for their reasonable
      expenses incurred in attending meetings.

4.    CHANGE OF FISCAL YEAR

      The Company changed its fiscal year from March 31 to October 31, beginning
      with the seven month period ended October 31, 2002. The change was made to
      facilitate the calculation of capital gain that must be paid by December
      31 for the twelve month period ending October 31.
