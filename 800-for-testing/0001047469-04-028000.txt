                                                              PRESIDENT'S LETTER

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:                                                   JULY 2004

The stock market posted a modest advance during the second quarter, as the S&P
500 Index gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq rose 2.8 percent. For the first
half, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq advanced 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent,
respectively.

     Key growth indices were also flat to modestly ahead for the second quarter
and first half. Returns for the Russell growth indices are summarized in the
table on the facing page. Most notable is the fact that small and mid-cap growth
stocks outperformed large cap growth stocks by a considerable margin for the
half. If second quarter returns are any indicator, however, that may be
changing, as the large caps led the way in the most recent reporting period.

     Overall, equity markets for the quarter took their cue from the prospect of
higher interest rates, rising oil prices, fears surrounding the handover of
power in Iraq and concerns over a slowdown in global economic growth. All
contributed to sluggishness in share prices. With this uncertainty as a
backdrop, energy stocks advanced, and financial stocks declined owing to
concerns over higher interest rates. Stocks have experienced a broad based
decline thus far in July as the market has failed to overcome the aforementioned
concerns.

     On the positive side, the economy continued to expand and corporate
earnings continued to rise. During the quarter, the government reported a 4.4
percent rise in first quarter GDP, up from the solid 4.1 percent pace registered
in the fourth quarter of 2003. By the time all reports are in, year-over-year
second quarter corporate earnings are expected to be ahead by more than 20
percent for the fourth quarter in a row--a rare event.

     Like the first quarter, Liberty All-Star Growth Fund returns were mixed for
the second quarter. With shares valued at net asset value with dividends
reinvested, the Fund gained 1.0 percent. This result was virtually in line with
the Fund's primary benchmark, the Lipper Multi-Cap Growth Mutual Fund Average,
which advanced 1.1 percent. The Fund's quarterly return also places it in the
mid-range of the three Russell growth indices summarized in the table. The
Fund's investment performance was generally acceptable, but an overweight to the
underperforming media industry proved a drag on overall results.

     The one negative note for the quarter was a 6.3 percent decline in the
market value of Fund shares with dividends reinvested. We believe this was not
related to investment performance, but to the Fund's premium. During the
quarter, the premium

                                        1
<Page>

at which Fund shares traded over NAV reached a high of 13.7 percent which,
historically, was unsustainably high.

     For the past year, lower quality stocks have outperformed higher quality
issues--a factor that has hampered the Fund's relative results. For the past
three years, however, the Fund ranks comfortably above median in the Lipper
Multi-Cap Growth Mutual Fund universe.

     One encouraging sign to come out of the second quarter was a gradual but
ongoing rotation to higher quality stocks, an investment strategy pursued by the
Fund's large cap investment manager, William Blair & Company. We invite you to
read the interview with investment manager and one of the firm's principals,
John Jostrand, beginning on page 8.

     On behalf of the entire team here at Liberty Asset Management Company, I
would like to thank shareholders for their ongoing support of the Fund. We
believe that the Fund is properly structured with a quality team of investment
managers, giving us confidence as we move into the future.

Sincerely,

/s/ William R. Parmentier, Jr.

MANAGERS' DIFFERING INVESTMENT STYLES ARE
REFLECTED IN PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS

The portfolio characteristics table below is a regular feature of the Fund's
shareholder reports. It serves as a useful tool for understanding the value of
the Fund's multi-managed portfolio. The characteristics are different for each
of the Fund's three investment managers. These differences are a reflection of
the fact that each has a different capitalization focus and investment strategy.
The shaded column highlights the characteristics of the Fund as a whole, while
the first three columns show portfolio characteristics for the S&P/BARRA
SmallCap, MidCap and LargeCap Growth indices.

The dark green region of the graph above reflects the growth of the investment
assuming all distributions were received in cash and not reinvested back in the
Fund. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $15,200 (this
value includes distributions per share totaling $7.66 during the period).

     The light green region of the graph depicts additional value realized
through reinvestment of all distributions and participation in all the rights
offerings under the terms of each offering. On three occasions, the Fund has
conducted rights offerings that allowed shareholders to purchase additional
shares at a discount. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to
$16,357.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc.'s current policy, in effect since 1997, is to
pay distributions on its shares totaling approximately 10 percent of its net
asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2.5 percent of
the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the
Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date. THE FIXED DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT
RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE FUND'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME OR NET REALIZED
CAPITAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND MAY BE TAXED AS ORDINARY INCOME UP TO THE AMOUNT OF
THE FUND'S CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS. If, for any calendar
year, the total distributions made under the 10 percent pay-out policy exceed
the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will
generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the
shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares. If the Fund's net investment
income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount distributed
under the 10 percent pay-out policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and
not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the
extent of such excess.

MANAGER INTERVIEW

[PHOTO OF JOHN F. JOSTRAND]

JOHN F. JOSTRAND
William Blair & Company, L.L.C.

AS THE ECONOMIC WINDS SHIFT, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY SEES HIGHER QUALITY
STOCKS BENEFITING

WILLIAM BLAIR IS ONE OF LIBERTY ALL-STAR GROWTH FUND'S THREE INVESTMENT
MANAGERS. CHICAGO-BASED WILLIAM BLAIR IS A GROWTH STYLE MANAGER EMPHASIZING
DISCIPLINED, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY QUALITY GROWTH COMPANIES WITH THE
ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THEIR GROWTH OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AT THE CORE OF THE
FIRM IS A TEAM OF ANALYSTS WHO PERFORM RESEARCH AIMED AT IDENTIFYING COMPANIES
THAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. RECENTLY, WE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH PRINCIPAL AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER JOHN F. JOSTRAND, CFA.

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS INTERVIEW REPRESENT THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S POSITION
AT THE TIME OF THE DISCUSSION (JULY 2004) AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

LAMCOCO: In last year's market rally, smaller cap, lower quality stocks surged
ahead of larger cap, higher quality stocks--not entirely surprising after the
three-year bear market and historically low interest rates. At this stage in the
market cycle and the economic recovery, however, one would expect higher quality
issues to outperform. Have you found that to be true through the first half of
2004?

JOSTRAND: The early months of 2004 saw a continuation of the trends from 2003;
low interest rates and stocks with lower capitalizations and earnings quality
continuing to outperform through the first quarter. As the growth in earnings
and the economy were decelerating towards more sustainable growth rates, there
was growing evidence, particularly in the second quarter, that the market was
pivoting towards quality.

     We recently completed a study of roughly 2,300 companies over a 15-year
period in which we sorted stocks into quintiles by beta--high beta to low beta.
The high beta, or lower quality stocks do very well in earnings recovery years.
That's when earnings explode off the bottom and rise dramatically, just as they
did in 2003. The study confirms, however, that the huge rebound in earnings
isn't sustainable. The economy either settles back to a more normalized rate of
growth or flattens out--sometimes even falling to recessionary levels. So, we
have three types of market environments: strong rebound, normal and
flat/recessionary. In the latter two environments, higher quality stocks
outperform, and the study confirms that quite persuasively.

LAMCO: Are second quarter earnings reports starting to provide hard evidence of
that, or is it too early to tell?

JOSTRAND: I think we're starting to pivot toward quality right now. To cite an
analogy, the wind was in the face of quality managers

                                        8

all last year. For about four months this year, the wind shifted across our bow
and started coming at us sideways. Now, we think, the wind is continuing to
shift, and as we get into the second half of the year the wind will be at our
back, propelling us ahead.

LAMCO: What are two large cap, high quality growth stocks in the portion of the
All-Star Growth Fund portfolio that you manage that have done well through the
first half of 2004?

JOSTRAND: The stocks with the largest percentage gains in the six-month period
ending June 30, 2004, are Avon Products (+36 percent) and Harley-Davidson (+29
percent).

     Avon is a company that we identified as an attractive candidate three years
ago due to financial restructuring, revitalization of the sales force (including
a new incentive compensation structure), and a growing presence in developing
markets such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Avon's ability to
successfully sell its products outside of retail stores also affords better
pricing options and brand control than competitors who rely on stores for
distribution. Avon's ability to achieve strong unit growth and improve margins
has been developing over a period of time, but was ultimately recognized by the
market in the first half of this year.

     Harley-Davidson's brand recognition and customer loyalty are among the
strongest anywhere, and unit sales continue to grow both in the U.S. and abroad.
The stock has been a core holding due to its continued unit growth and better
margins, owing to improved efficiencies and technological advances in
manufacturing automation.

LAMCO: There is a belief that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will
raise short-term interest rates three times for a total of 75 to 100 basis
points before the end of the year. In June, the FOMC raised rates 25 basis
points. Do you think that is likely to serve as a drag on the stock market, or
merely do its intended job, that is, to slow growth and temper inflation? Or, do
you feel there are other factors that are greater cause for concern, e.g., oil
prices, presidential election uncertainties and geopolitical tensions?

JOSTRAND: Due to the low level of short-term interest rates, the FOMC has
indicated a predisposition to raising rates to a more natural level--i.e., about
the level of the "core" inflation rate. All indications by the FOMC lead the
markets to believe there will be two to three additional 25-basis point
increases in short-term interest rates before year-end. At this point, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has conducted what could be considered to be the
worst-kept secret, or the best choreographed economic maneuver: He has virtually
announced the FOMC's plans such that the market has time to digest these rate
increases well in advance.

    Since the Fed actions will primarily affect rates at the short end of the
market, there is the possibility that longer-term rates may remain relatively
stable. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) settles in at a growth rate

OUR BACK..."

"WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON COMPANIES WITH SUSTAINABLE EARNINGS GROWTH THAT SHOULD
PERFORM WELL IN A MODESTLY EXPANDING ENVIRONMENT."

                                        9

of two to three percent, then the long end of the yield curve will likely remain
at under 5.0 percent. This environment would imply a price-to-earnings (P/E)
ratio compression from 20x, where we were at the start of the year, to the
current multiple of approximately 17x. Now that P/E compression has occurred and
earnings are poised to achieve continued, albeit slower growth, the market could
finish the year stronger.

     With respect to other factors in the market, the ongoing uncertainty in the
Middle East is causing energy-related stocks to continue to show strength, but
also to have a negative impact on CPI. Oil is a contributor to CPI and
geopolitical concerns are inflating the most recent CPI numbers. However, our
view is that core CPI (CPI minus the volatile food and energy components) is the
paramount gauge of inflation. At this point, the core CPI level does not concern
us.

     The upcoming Presidential election is generating concerns about the
economic policies that may be adopted in the next administration. This
factor--combined with geopolitical concerns in the Middle East and rising
interest rates--is lending uncertainty to the financial markets, and it is
possible that unexpected changes could have an impact on overall market
direction.

     We continue to focus on companies with sustainable earnings growth that
should perform well in a modestly expanding environment. Barring an
unpredictable economic shock, we would expect our stocks to benefit from a
moderate economic growth cycle.

LAMCO: In brief, what are the main points in the bull market case for continued
stock market strength?

JOSTRAND: The key to market growth is that inflation stabilizes at current
levels. The market has spent the year adjusting to the acceleration in CPI by
marking down P/E ratios. If the CPI stabilizes and we see an increase in capital
spending (resulting in new supply and, therefore, relief from price pressure),
the market is likely to settle into a multiple of 16 to 17x for an appropriate
P/E level.

     In our own case as a high quality, large cap growth manager, I would go
back to my earlier analogy about the shifting wind. The shifting or rotating
wind puts pressure on low quality stocks. Why? Those companies tend to require
external financing--maybe they have money-losing operations that require outside
financing. When interest rates or inflation rise, it tends to put pressure on
P/E multiples, particularly for companies with the highest multiples.
Furthermore, as we finish the early phase of the recovery when earnings growth
is both surprising and unsustainable, we see high quality, durable growth return
to its normal prominence in investors' eyes.

LAMCO: Many thanks for the comments. It's sure to be an interesting second
half.

"...AS WE FINISH THE EARLY PHASE OF THE RECOVERY WHEN EARNINGS GROWTH IS
BOTH SURPRISING AND UNSUSTAINABLE, WE SEE HIGH QUALITY, DURABLE GROWTH RETURN TO
ITS NORMAL PROMINENCE..."

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

I. ORGANIZATION

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a Maryland corporation
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended, as
a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.

FUND SHARES

The Fund may issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 par.

II. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Equity securities are valued at the last sale price at the close of the
principal exchange on which they trade. Unlisted securities or listed securities
for which there were no sales during the day are valued at the closing bid price
on such exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

     Short-term debt obligations maturing in more than 60 days for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at current market value. Short-term
debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

     Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are
valued at fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied
procedures approved by and under the general supervision of the Board of
Directors.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with institutions that
the Fund's investment advisor has determined are creditworthy. The Fund, through
its custodian, receives delivery of underlying securities collateralizing a
repurchase agreement. Collateral is at least equal, at all times, to the value
of the repurchase obligation including interest. A repurchase agreement
transaction involves certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the
counterparty. These risks include possible delays or restrictions upon the
Fund's ability to dispose of the underlying securities and a possible decline in
the value of the underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to
assert its rights.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Corporate actions and dividend
income are recorded on the ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

Consistent with the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable income to shareholders, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund currently has a policy of paying

                                       24
<Page>

distributions on its common shares totaling approximately 10% of its net asset
value per year. The distributions are payable in four quarterly distributions of
2.5% of the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange
on the Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on ex-date.

III. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2003
was as follows:

<Table>
    <S>                                         <C>
    Distributions paid from:

                                                -------------
                                                    7,098,737
    Return of capital                               4,528,603
                                                -------------
                                                $  11,627,340
</Table>

*For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions, if any, are considered
ordinary income distributions.

     The following capital loss carryforwards, determined as of December 31,
2003, may be available to reduce taxable income arising from future net realized
gains on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
Code:

<Table>
<Caption>
      YEAR OF         CAPITAL LOSS
    EXPIRATION        CARRYFORWARD
    ----------        ------------
       <S>           <C>
       2009          $    5,781,653

       2010              11,242,729
                     --------------
                     $   17,024,382
</Table>

Future realized gains offset by the loss carryforwards are not required to be
distributed to shareholders. However, under the Fund's distribution policy, as
described above, such gains may be distributed to shareholders in the year gains
are realized. Any such gains distributed may be taxable to shareholders as
ordinary income.

IV. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

Liberty Asset Management Company ("LAMCO"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor of the Fund.
Prior to April 1, 2004, LAMCO was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Fund's investment advisor, was acquired by BOA. The
acquisition did not change the way the Fund is managed, the investment personnel
assigned to manage the Fund or the fees paid by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

LAMCO receives a quarterly investment advisory fee based on the Fund's average
weekly net assets at the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
    AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS           FEE RATE
    -------------------------           --------

    Over $300 million                   0.72%
</Table>

Under Portfolio Manager Agreements, LAMCO pays each Portfolio Manager a
portfolio management fee based on the assets of the investment portfolio that
they manage. The portfolio management fee is paid from the investment advisory
fees collected by LAMCO and is based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at
the following annual rates:

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia"), an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of BOA and an affiliate of LAMCO, is responsible for providing
pricing and bookkeeping services to the Fund under a pricing and bookkeeping
agreement. Under a separate agreement (the "Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia
has delegated those functions to State Street Corporation ("State Street").
Columbia pays the total fees collected from the Fund for these services to State
Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

     Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Fund, Columbia
receives from the Fund an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any
month that the Fund's average weekly net assets exceed $50 million, an
additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is calculated by taking into
account the fees payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. This
rate is applied to the average daily net assets of the Fund for that month. The
Fund also pays additional fees for pricing services. For the six months ended
June 30, 2004, the annualized effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was
0.032%.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. The Fund could have invested a portion of the
assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement in an income
producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS

The Fund pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
LAMCO or its affiliates.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Fund related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Fund paid $1,506 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Miscellaneous expense"
on the Statement of Operations.
