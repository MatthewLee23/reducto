The third calendar quarter exhibited mixed results for the healthcare/biotech
sectors. As the quarter began, both the American Stock Exchange Biotechnology
Index (BTK) and the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NBI) were declining, continuing
a trend that had been in place since March. Both indices reached a nadir in
early/mid August and then advanced noticeably as the quarter progressed. This
upward trend continued through the early part of the fourth calendar quarter.
Overall the biotech sector, as measured by these indices continues to be
somewhat volatile. It is our opinion that recent price trends have not been
driven by events within the healthcare or biotechnology sector. Rather we think
that external events, including presidential election dynamics, movement in
energy costs and geopolitical developments have drowned out sector news. It may
also be that rotation of funds into and out of the biotech sector may have also
had an effect. Within the biotech sector, there has been both positive
encouraging and negative discouraging news (in terms of clinical results, FDA
panel meetings and and/or product approvals). In our view, neither the good nor
the bad news has been dominating. And as indicated, we think the sector view has
been overwhelmed by general market factors. We are encouraged that the first few
weeks of the fourth calendar quarter have produced encouraging results. We are
particularly encouraged now that there is a definitive result in the
presidential election.

                                        1
<Page>

We think that there are pending positive events within the biotech sector that
could buoy the biotech market. We are less sanguine about the big pharmaceutical
company space given the negative background impact of pricing uncertainties as
well as Merck's recent difficulties surrounding the withdrawl of Vioxx from the
market. Given recent weakness in the generic group we are cautious about the
prospects of that group. At this point we are more impressed with the prospects
of the biotechnology sector and have established new positions in companies
which we think have interesting products and/or pipelines. We also have a
generally favorable view of the prospects for the medtech sector.

During the quarter, the Fund established positions in Ariad Pharmaceuticals,
Barr Pharmaceuticals, Guilford Pharmaceuticals, Myogen, Seattle Genetics, and
Vicuron Pharmaceuticals. The Fund increased its holdings of Adolor Corporation,
and deCode Genetics. The Fund's position in Amgen increased as a result of
Amgen's acquisition of Tularik which was also held by the Fund. The Fund
decreased its holdings in Celgene, IVAX, and Pozen. The Fund exited its
positions in Durect, Encysive Pharmaceuticals, and United Therapeutics.

Within the venture portfolio, the Fund made follow on investments in Conor
Medsystems, and made an initial investment in Provident Senior Living Trust.

Please note that we have elected to change the principal indices against which
we benchmark performance. During the last several years, we have used a
comparison to the American Stock Exchange's Biotech Index (commonly known at the
BTK) as our principal comparator. This index comprises 17 relatively large
biotechnology companies. As of September 30, 2004 seven of the Fund's 44
publicly traded investments were components of the BTK. One transaction
completed in the quarter ended September 30, 2004 involved a BTK component. In
contrast to the BTK, the NASDAQ Biotech index (commonly known as the NBI) is
comprised of approximately 150 small and large biotech companies including
several companies that are also part of the BTK. As of September 30, 2004, 30 of
the Fund's 44 publicly traded investments were components of the NBI. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2004, 11 of the 16 position changes made by the Fund
involved NBI components. We believe that the NBI is the more appropriate primary
index with which to compare performance. In addition to the primary index, the
Fund has traditionally reported performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
the Russell 2000 index and the NASDAQ Industrials. Going forward, we will not
use these indices as comparators but will compare the Fund's performance (both
NAV and total stock return) to the S&P 500.

As always, please feel free to call me with any questions or comments you might
have. As you may have noticed, the focus of this shareholder letter has been
changed to emphasize specific developments in the biotech and healthcare sector
and in the portfolio. This change is the result of shareholder input. Several
shareholders have suggested that the macroeconomic views we have presented in
the past are available elsewhere. It was suggested that shareholders would
rather hear more about the sector in which the Fund invests and about specific
events within the Fund's portfolio. We thought that was a good idea. Please let
us know if you agree (or disagree). Also note that the organization and
presentation of information in this portion of the annual report has been
changed to comply with recent regulatory requirement changes. And finally, we
have changed the paper stock on which the report is printed to reduce costs.

(1)  In 2002, the Fund adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting
     Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting discounts and amortizing
     premiums on all debt securities. The effect of this change for the year
     ended September 30, 2002 was a decrease in net investment loss per share of
     $.006, an increase in net realized and unrealized loss on investments per
     share of $.006, and a decrease in the ratio of net investment loss to
     average net assets from (1.28%) to (1.25%). Per share data and ratios for
     the periods prior to October 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this
     change in presentation.

(2)  Net investment loss per share has been computed using average shares
     outstanding.

                               SEPTEMBER 30, 2004

(1) ORGANIZATION

       H&Q Life Sciences Investors (the Fund) is a Massachusetts business trust
    registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified
    closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is
    long-term capital appreciation through investment in securities of companies
    in the healthcare industries. The Fund invests primarily in securities of
    public and private companies that are believed to have significant potential
    for above-average growth. The Fund was organized on February 20, 1992 and
    commenced operations on May 8, 1992.

       The Fund has adopted investment policies (non-fundamental investment
    policies) which may be changed by action of the Board of Trustees without
    shareholder approval. In June 2004, the Board of Trustees took action to
    make the following change (as indicated by the strikethrough) to one of the
    Fund's non fundamental investment policies:

    "Investments will not be made in any company with the objective of
    exercising control over that company's management, [STRIKETHROUGH] AND
    THE FUND GENERALLY WILL NOT PROVIDE MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY SUCH
    COMPANY AS IS NORMALLY THE CASE WITH VENTURE CAPITAL
    FUNDS.[/STRIKETHROUGH] The Fund, however, may make investments as a
    co-investor with other venture capital groups that may provide issuers
    with significant managerial assistance."

       In June and September, 2004, the Board of Trustees amended the Fund's
    by-laws to provide for the office of Chief Compliance Officer and to require
    that all matters put to a vote of shareholders shall be decided by a vote of
    the majority of all votes validly cast at a meeting at which a quorum is
    present, unless otherwise specifically required by the Fund's Declaration of
    Trust or By-Laws.

       The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of certain
    estimates by management in determining the Fund's assets, liabilities,
    revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
    following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
    followed by the Fund, which are in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

    INVESTMENT SECURITIES

       Investments traded on national securities exchanges or in the
    over-the-counter market that are National Market System securities are
    valued at the last sale price or, lacking any sales, at the mean between the
    last bid and asked prices. Other over-the-counter securities are valued at
    the most recent bid prices as obtained from one or more dealers that make
    markets in the securities. Exchange traded investments for which market
    quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined
    in good faith by the Trustees of the Fund. The value of venture capital and
    other restricted securities is determined in good faith by the Trustees.
    However, because of the uncertainty of venture capital and other restricted
    security valuations, these estimated values may differ significantly from
    the values that would have been used had a ready market for these securities
    existed, and the differences could be material. See note 4 below. Temporary
    investments with maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

       Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Gains and
    losses from sales of investments are recorded using the "identified cost"
    method. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividend income is
    recorded on the ex-dividend date.

    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

       In connection with transactions in repurchase agreements, the Fund's
    custodian takes possession of the underlying collateral securities, the
    market value of which is at least equal to the principal, including accrued
    interest, of the repurchase transaction at all times. In the event of
    default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization
    and/or retention of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

                                       15

    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

       It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
    to its shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and its net
    realized capital gains, if any. Therefore, no Federal income or excise tax
    provision is required.

    DISTRIBUTIONS

       The Fund records all distributions to shareholders from net investment
    income, if any, and realized gains on the ex-dividend date. Such
    distributions are determined in conformity with income tax regulations. Due
    to permanent book/tax differences in accounting for certain transactions,
    certain distributions may be treated as distributions from capital as
    opposed to distributions of net investment income or realized capital gains.

    DISTRIBUTION POLICY

       Distributions will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the
    Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Pursuant to an SEC
    exemptive order, the Fund has implemented a fixed distribution policy that
    permits the Fund to make quarterly distributions at a rate of 2% of the
    Fund's net assets to shareholders of record. The Fund intends to use net
    realized capital gains when making quarterly distributions. This could
    result in a return of capital to shareholders if the amount of the
    distribution exceeds the Fund's net investment income and realized capital
    gains. It is anticipated that net realized capital gains in excess of the
    total distributed under this policy would be included in the December
    distribution.

       Pursuant to Section 852 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund has
    designated $16,063,421 as a long-term capital gain distribution for its
    taxable year ended September 30, 2004.

    STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

       The cash amount shown in the Statement of Cash Flows is the amount
    included in the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities and represents
    cash on hand at its custodian and does not include temporary cash
    investments at September 30, 2004.

    INDEMNIFICATIONS

       Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and Trustees may
    be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the
    performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course
    of business, the Fund enters into agreements with service providers that may
    contain indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
    agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
    against the fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience,
    the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

(2) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

       The aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment
    securities (other than temporary cash investments) for the year ended
    September 30, 2004 totaled $64,306,635 and $62,449,141 respectively.

       At September 30, 2004, the total cost of securities for Federal income
    tax purposes was $174,911,515. The net unrealized gain on securities held by
    the Fund was $16,912,198, including gross unrealized gain of $50,002,742 and
    gross unrealized loss of $33,090,544.

                                       16

       At September 30, 2004, the Fund was committed to participate in a round
    of financing to purchase additional shares of restricted preferred stock for
    approximately $706,172.

(3) INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

       The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement (the Advisory
    Agreement) with Hambrecht & Quist Capital Management LLC (the Adviser).
    Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a
    monthly fee at the rate when annualized of (i) 2.5% of the average net
    assets for the month of its venture capital and other restricted securities
    up to 25% of net assets and (ii) for the month, for all other assets, 1.0%
    of the average net assets up to $250 million, 0.9% of the average net assets
    for the next $250 million, 0.8% of the average net assets for the next $500
    million and 0.7% of the average net assets thereafter. The aggregate fee may
    not exceed a rate when annualized of 1.375%. Certain officers and Trustees
    of the Fund are also officers of the Adviser.

       Trustees who are not affiliates of the Adviser receive an annual fee of
    $20,000 plus $500 for each Committee on which they serve and $1,000 for each
    meeting attended.

(4) VENTURE CAPITAL AND OTHER RESTRICTED SECURITIES

       The Fund may invest in venture capital and other restricted securities if
    these securities would currently comprise 40% or less of net assets. The
    value of these securities represents 25.89% of the Fund's net assets at
    September 30, 2004.

       The Fund maintains an investment restriction that prohibits the Fund from
    purchasing more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any issuer.
    In order to clarify that restriction, the Board of Trusttes (effective
    September 30, 2004), has determined that for purposes of that restriction,
    the Fund will consider outstanding voting securities of an issuer to include
    any security of the issuer that entitles the owner or holder to vote for the
    election of directors of the issuer (a "voting security") and any other
    outstanding security of the issuer that is exercisable for or convertible
    into a voting security within 60 days from the date of calculation.

       During the year ended September 30, 2004, certain restricted securities
    were exchanged for cash in connection with a corporate action, a portion of
    which has been retained by the issuer in an escrow account pending
    resolution of certain contingencies and whose estimated value of $388,000 at
    September 30, 2004 has been determined by the Trustees. On September 30,
    2004, the Fund has a 5% interest bearing promissory note due October 31,
    2004 from the sale of restricted securities, with a par value of $80,800 and
    an estimated value of $80,000 as determined by the Trustees. The value of
    the escrow account and note are included in the Receivable for Investments
    Sold in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
                                 ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF H&Q LIFE SCIENCES INVESTORS:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of H&Q Life
Sciences Investors (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments, as of
September 30, 2004, and the related statements of operations, changes in net
assets, and cash flows and the financial highlights for the year then ended.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. The financial
highlights of the Fund for the year ended September 30, 2000 were audited by
other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial highlights in their report dated November
3, 2000. The statement of changes in net assets of the Fund for the year ended
September 30, 2003 and the financial highlights for the years ended September
30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated
November 25, 2003, expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement and
financial highlights.

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of September 30, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of H&Q
Life Sciences Investors as of September 30, 2004, and the results of its
operations, its cash flows, the changes in its net assets, and the financial
highlights for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Pursuant to the registrant's Audit Committee Charter ("Charter"), the Audit

the Audit Committee is responsible for approving any and all proposals by the
registrant, its investment adviser or their affiliated persons or any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that
provides services to the registrant to employ the independent auditor to
render permissible non-audit services to such entity, provided those
permissible non-audit services relate directly to the operations and
financial reporting of the registrant. In determining whether to pre-approve
non-audit services, the Audit Committee considers whether such services are
consistent with the independent auditor's independence. The Charter further
permits the Audit Committee to delegate to one or more of its members
authority to pre-approve permissible non-audit services to the registrant,
provided that any pre-approval determination of a delegate is for services
with an estimated budget of less than $15,000.

financial reporting of the registrant. As disclosed above in Items 4(b)
through (d), there were no fees for such services during the applicable
periods.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Registrant has adopted the following proxy voting policies and procedures:

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

POLICY

     The following are the policies and procedures adopted and implemented by
Hambrecht & Quist Capital Mangement LLC (the "Adviser") for voting proxies with
respect to portfolio securities held by H&Q Healthcare Investors and H&Q Life
Sciences Investors (each a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds"). The policies
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in the
best interest of the Funds and the Funds' shareholders, in accordance with the
Adviser's fiduciary duties and Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). The Adviser considers the "best
interests" of the Funds and their shareholders to mean their best long-term
economic interests.

     The Adviser shall vote proxies for the exclusive benefit, and in the best
economic interest, of the Funds and their shareholders. Such exercise of voting
rights shall be subject to the same standard of care as is generally applicable
to the Adviser's performance of its duties, as set forth in the advisory
agreements with the Funds. The policies and procedures contained herein are
designed to be guidelines, however each vote is ultimately cast on a
case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. Any material conflicts that may arise
will be resolved in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.

     A proxy committee has been designated and is responsible for administering
and overseeing the proxy voting process. The committee consists of the President
of the Adviser, the Treasurer of the Adviser, and the analyst responsible for
oversight of the company that is the subject of the proxy. The committee
considers proxy questions and determines the vote on behalf of the Funds.

PROCEDURES

LOGISTICS

     The Treasurer shall be responsible for maintaining the proxy log,
monitoring corporate actions and confirming the timely voting of proxies. The
proxy log shall contain the following information, in accordance with Form N-PX:

  -  the name of the issuer;

  -  the exchange ticker symbol, if available;

  -  the CUSIP number, if available;

  -  the shareholder meeting date;

  -  a brief identification of the matter voted on;

  -  whether the matter was proposed by the issuer or a security holder;

  -  whether the Adviser cast its vote on the matter;

  -  how the Adviser cast its vote on the matter (for, against, abstain; for or
     withhold regarding the election of directors); and

  -  whether the Adviser cast its vote for or against management;

     The Treasurer shall also record whether any conflicts of interest have been
identified and, if so, what action was taken to resolve the conflict with
respect to each vote cast and each abstention.

SUBSTANTIVE VOTING DECISIONS

<Page>

     The Adviser's substantive voting decisions turn on the particular facts and
circumstances of each proxy vote. The following is a list of common proxy vote
issues and the Adviser's standard considerations when determining how to vote
such proxies.

     Routine Matters/Corporate Administrative Items. After an initial review,
the Adviser generally votes with management on routine matters related to the
operation of the issuer that are not expected to have a significant economic
impact on the issuer and/or its shareholders.

     Potential for Major Economic Impact. The Adviser reviews and analyzes on a
case-by-case basis, non-routine proposals that are more likely to affect the
structure and operation of the issuer and to have a greater impact on the value
of the investment.

     Corporate Governance. The Adviser reviews and considers corporate
governance issues related to proxy matters and generally supports proposals that
foster good corporate governance practices.

     Special Interest Issues. The Adviser considers: (i) the long-term benefit
to shareholders of promoting corporate accountability and responsibility on
social issues; (ii) management's responsibility with respect to special interest
issues; (iii) any economic costs and restrictions on management; and (iv) the
responsibility of the Adviser to vote proxies for the greatest long-term
shareholder value.

     Limitations on Director Tenure and Retirement. The Adviser considers: (i) a
reasonable retirement age for directors, E.G. 70 or 72; (ii) the introduction of
new perspectives on the board; and (iii) the arbitrary nature of such
limitations and the possibility of detracting from the board's stability and
continuity.

     Directors' Minimum Stock Ownership. The Adviser considers: (i) the benefits
of additional vested interest; (ii) the ability of a director to serve a company
well regardless of the extent of his or her share ownership; and (iii) the
impact of limiting the number of persons qualified to be directors.

     D&O Indemnification and Liability Protection. The Adviser considers: (i)
indemnifying directors for acts conducted in the normal course of business; (ii)
limiting liability for monetary damages for violating the duty of care; (iii)
expanding coverage beyond legal expenses to acts that represent more serious
violations of fiduciary obligation than carelessness (E.G. negligence); and (iv)
providing expanded coverage in cases when a director's legal defense was
unsuccessful if the director was found to have acted in good faith and in a
manner that he or she reasonably believed was in the best interests of the
issuer.

     Director Nominations in Contested Elections. The Adviser considers: (i)
long-term financial performance of the issuer relative to its industry; (ii)
management's track record; (iii) background to proxy contest; (iv)
qualifications of both slates of nominees; (v) evaluations of what each side is
offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the proposed objectives and
goals can be met; and (vi) stock ownership positions.

     Cumulative Voting. The Adviser considers: (i) the ability of significant
stockholders to elect a director of their choosing; (ii) the ability of minority
shareholders to concentrate their support in favor of a director or directors of
their choosing; and (iii) the potential to limit the ability of directors to
work for all shareholders.

     Classified Boards. The Adviser considers: (i) providing continuity; (ii)
promoting long-term planning; and (iii) guarding against unwanted takeovers.

     Poison Pills. The Adviser considers: (i) the Adviser's position on
supporting proposals to require a shareholder vote on other shareholder rights
plans; (ii) ratifying or redeeming a poison pill in the interest of protecting
the value of the issuer; and (iii) other alternatives to prevent a takeover at a
price demonstrably below the true value of the issuer.

     Fair Price Provisions. The Adviser considers: (i) the vote required to
approve the proposed acquisition; (ii) the vote required to repeal the fair
price provision; (iii) the mechanism for determining fair price; and (iv)
whether these provisions are bundled with other anti-takeover measures (E.G.,
supermajority voting requirements) that may entrench management and discourage
attractive tender offers.

     Equal Access. The Adviser considers: (i) the opportunity for significant
shareholders of the issuer to evaluate and propose voting recommendations on
proxy proposals and director nominees, and to nominate candidates to the board;
and (ii) the added complexity and burden.

     Charitable Contributions. The Adviser considers: (i) the potential benefits
to shareholders; (ii) the potential to detract the issuer's resources from more
direct uses of increasing shareholder value; and (iii) the responsibility of
shareholders to make individual contributions.

     Stock Authorizations: The Adviser considers: (i) the need for the increase;
(ii) the percentage increase with respect to the existing authorization; (iii)
voting rights of the stock; and (iv) overall capitalization structures.

<Page>

     Preferred Stock. The Adviser considers: (i) whether the new class of
preferred stock has unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and
other rights; (ii) whether the issuer expressly states that the stock will not
be used as a takeover defense or carry superior voting rights; (iii) whether the
issuer specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such
stock and the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable; and (iv) whether
the stated purpose is to raise capital or make acquisitions in the normal course
of business.

     Director Compensation. The Adviser considers: (i) whether director shares
are at the same market risk as those of the shareholders; and (ii) how option
programs for outside directors compare with the standards of internal programs.

     Golden and Tin Parachutes. The Adviser considers: (i) whether they will be
submitted for shareholder approval; and (ii) the employees covered by the plan
and the quality of management.

LIMITATIONS

     The Adviser may abstain from voting a proxy if it concludes that the effect
on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is
indeterminable or insignificant. The Adviser may abstain from voting a proxy if
it concludes that the cost of voting is disproportionate to the economic impact
the vote would have on the portfolio holdings.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     The Proxy Committee identifies any potential conflicts of interest. Each
potential conflict must be addressed in a manner which will be in the best
interest of the Funds and their shareholders. If any potential conflict is
identified the Proxy Committee consults with the Adviser's CCO. Where conflicts
of interest arise between clients and the Adviser, the Adviser may convene an
ad-hoc committee to debate the conflict and to give a ruling on a preferred
course of action. If the ad-hoc committee determines that the Adviser has a

                                 CODE OF ETHICS

                          SARBANES-OXLEY CODE OF ETHICS

INTRODUCTION

         The Board of Trustees of H&Q Life Sciences Investors and H&Q
Healthcare Investors (each, a "Fund") has established this Code of Ethics
("Code") in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
promulgated thereunder. This Code does not supersede or otherwise affect the
separate code of ethics that the Fund and its investment adviser have adopted
pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
("1940 Act").

         This Code is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote: (i) honest
and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; (ii)
full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
Fund; (iii) compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and
regulations; (iv) the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to
an appropriate person or persons; and (v) accountability for adherence to the
Code. The Code applies to the Fund's President and Treasurer and Secretary
(collectively, "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A).

A.  PRINCIPLES OF HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT

         1. General Objectives

         The Fund expects all Covered Officers to adhere to the highest possible
standards of honest and ethical conduct. All Covered Officers are expected to
handle actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
professional relationships in a manner that is above reproach, and to place the
interests of the Fund above their own personal interests.

         2.  Conflicts of Interest

         All Covered Officers should be scrupulous in avoiding a conflict of
interest with regard to the Fund's interests. A conflict of interest occurs when
an individual's private interest interferes in any way with the interests of the
Fund. This includes any specific situation or transaction that the Trustees of
the Fund who are not interested persons as defined in the 1940 Act, would
consider to create the appearance of a conflict of interest. A conflict
situation can arise when a Covered Officer takes actions or has interests that
may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Fund objectively and
effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when a Covered Officer, or a
member of his or her family, receives improper benefits as a result of his or
her position with the Fund, whether such benefits are received from the Fund or
a third party. Any conflict of interest that arises in a specific situation or
transaction must be disclosed by the Covered Officer and resolved before taking
any action.

         Conflicts of interest may not always be evident, and Covered Officers
should consult with the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer or the Fund's legal
counsel if they are uncertain about any situation.

         Examples of possible conflicts of interest include:

    I)   OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ACTIVITIES. Covered Officers may not engage in
         any outside employment or activity that interferes with their
         performance or responsibilities to the Fund or is otherwise in
         conflict with or prejudicial to the Fund. A Covered Officer must
         disclose to the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer any outside
         employment or activity that may constitute a conflict of interest
         and obtain the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer's approval before
         engaging in any such employment or activity.

   II)   GIFTS. Covered Officers may not accept gifts or other items of more
         than small value, consistent with industry standards from any person
         or entity that does business with or on behalf of the Fund.

   III)  OTHER SITUATIONS. Because other conflicts of interest may arise, it
         would be impractical to attempt to list all possible situations in
         this Code. If a proposed transaction or situation raises questions
         or doubts, a Covered Officer should consult with the Funds' Chief
         Compliance Officer before engaging in the transaction or activity.

<page>

         3.  Corporate Opportunities

         Covered Officers may not exploit for their own personal gain, or for
the personal gain or their family members or relatives, opportunities that are
discovered through the use of Fund property, information, or position, unless
the opportunity is first disclosed fully in writing to the Board of Trustees and
the Board of Trustees declines to pursue such opportunity.

B.  FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY, AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE IN FUND
DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING DOCUMENTS

         As a registered investment company, it is of critical importance that
the Fund's public communications, reports, and filings contain full, fair,
accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure. Accordingly, Covered Officers
are expected to consider it central to their roles as officers of the Fund to
promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in the
Fund's public communications and reports, and in the documents that the Fund
files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

         Depending on his or her position with the Fund, a Covered Officer may
be called upon to provide necessary information to make the Fund's public
reports, communications, and SEC filings and submissions complete, fair, and
understandable. The Fund expects Covered Officers to take this responsibility
very seriously and to provide prompt and accurate answers to inquiries related
to the Fund's public disclosure requirements. Covered Officers may be asked to
certify the accuracy of all responses and information provided for inclusion in
the Fund's public reports, communications, and SEC filings and submissions.

C.  COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL RULES AND REGULATIONS

         As a registered investment company, the Fund is subject to regulation
by the SEC and must comply with Federal securities laws and regulations, as well
as other applicable laws. The Fund insists on strict compliance with the spirit
and the letter of these laws and regulations. Each Covered Officer shall
cooperate with Fund counsel, the Fund's independent accountants, and the Fund's
other service providers with the goal of maintaining the Fund's material
compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations.

         The Fund expects its Covered Officers to comply with all laws, rules,
and regulations applicable to the Fund's operations and business. Covered
Officers should seek guidance whenever they are in doubt as to the applicability
of any law, rule, or regulation, or regarding any contemplated course of action.
Covered Officers should also make use of the various guidelines which the Fund
and its service providers have prepared on specific laws and regulations. If in
doubt on a course of action, a good guideline is "always ask first, act later"
- -- if you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance before you
act.

<page>

         Covered Officers are encouraged to attend courses and seminars for the
purpose of keeping themselves apprised of developments relating to those
governmental statutes, rules, and regulations applicable to the Fund.

         Upon obtaining knowledge of any material violation of any applicable
law, rule, or regulation by the Fund or a person acting with or on behalf of the
Fund, a Covered Officer shall report such violation to the Funds' Compliance
Officer, Fund counsel, or both. (See Section VI of the Code for a discussion of
reporting Code violations.) Each Covered Officer shall cooperate or take such
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to remedy any such material violation.

D.  CONFIDENTIALITY

         Covered Officers must maintain the confidentiality of information
entrusted to them by the Fund, except when disclosure is authorized by Fund
counsel or required by laws or regulations. Whenever possible, Covered Officers
should consult with Fund counsel if they believe they have a legal obligation to
disclose confidential information. Confidential information includes all
non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the
Fund or its shareholders, if disclosed. The obligation to preserve confidential
information continues even after employment as a Covered Officer ends.

E.  PROMPT INTERNAL REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE;  EVALUATION OF
POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS;  DETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS

          1.  Reporting to the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer

                  A Covered Officer shall promptly report knowledge of, or
           information concerning, any material violation of this Code to the
           Funds' Chief Compliance Officer. Any such report shall preferably be
           in writing, and shall describe in reasonable detail the conduct that
           such Covered Officer believes to have violated this Code. The Funds'
           Chief Compliance Officer shall also have the authority to draft a
           report of a suspected material violation of the Code, if no written
           report is made by a Covered Officer.

           2.  Evaluation of Reports

                  The Funds' Chief Compliance Officer shall then consult with
           Fund counsel to the extent necessary to determine whether the
           reported conduct actually violates the Code. If it is determined that
           there has been a violation of the Code, the Funds' Chief Compliance
           Officer will determine (in consultation with Fund counsel) whether
           the violation has had or may have, in the reasonable judgment of the
           Funds' Chief Compliance Officer, a material adverse impact upon the
           Fund.

              i   NO MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FUND. If the Funds' Chief
                  Compliance Officer determines that the violation has not
                  caused a material adverse impact upon the Fund, the Funds'
                  Chief Compliance Officer shall determine what sanctions, if
                  any, may be appropriate for the violation. (See G of this
                  Code for a discussion of possible sanctions.)

<page>

             ii   MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FUND. If the Funds' Chief
                  Compliance Officer determines that the violation has caused
                  a material adverse impact upon the Fund, the Funds' Chief
                  Compliance Officer shall promptly notify the Board of such
                  violation. The Board shall be entitled to consult with
                  independent legal counsel to determine whether the
                  violation actually has had a material adverse impact upon
                  the Fund; to formulate sanctions, if any, appropriate for
                  the violation; or for any other purpose that the Board, in
                  its business judgment, determines to be necessary or
                  advisable. (See G of this Code for a discussion of possible
                  sanctions.)

           3.  Periodic Reports by the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer to Board
               of Trustees.

                  The Funds' Chief Compliance Officer shall report to the Board
           at each regularly scheduled Board meeting all violations of this Code
           (whether or not they caused a material adverse impact upon the Fund)
           and all sanctions imposed.

F.  WAIVERS OF PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

                  1.  Waivers.

                           A Covered Officer may request a waiver of a provision
                  of this Code if there is a reasonable likelihood that a
                  contemplated action would be a material departure from a
                  provision of the Code. Waivers will not be granted except
                  under extraordinary or special circumstances.

                  The process of requesting a waiver shall consist of the
                  following steps:

                      i.   The Covered Officer shall set forth a request for
                           waiver in writing and submit such request to the
                           Funds' Chief Compliance Officer. The request shall
                           describe the conduct, activity, or transaction for
                           which the Covered Officer seeks a waiver, and
                           shall briefly explain the reason for engaging in
                           the conduct, activity, or transaction.

                     ii.   The determination with respect to the waiver shall
                           be made in a timely fashion by the Funds' Chief
                           Compliance Officer, in consultation with Fund
                           counsel, and submitted to the Board for
                           ratification.

                     iii.  The decision with respect to the waiver request
                           shall be documented and kept in the Fund's records
                           for the appropriate period mandated by applicable
                           law or regulation.

                  2.  Disclosure of Waivers.

                           To the extent required by applicable law, waivers
                  (including "implicit waivers") shall be publicly disclosed on
                  a timely basis. An "implicit waiver" is defined as the Fund's
                  failure to take action within a reasonable period of time
                  regarding a material departure from a provision of the Code
                  that has been made known to an "executive officer" of the
                  Fund. For this purpose, an "executive officer" is a Fund's
                  President or

<page>

                  Chief Executive Officer, Vice President (who is in charge
                  of a principal policymaking function), or any other person
                  who performs similar policymaking functions for the Fund.
                  For the purpose of determining whether an "implicit waiver"
                  has occurred, if a material departure from a provision of
                  the Code is known only by the Covered Officer who has
                  caused the material departure, the material departure will
                  not be considered to have been made known to an executive
                  officer of the Fund.

G.  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE CODE

         The matters covered in this Code are of the utmost importance to the
Fund and its shareholders, and are essential to the Fund's ability to conduct
its business in accordance with its stated values. Covered Officers are expected
to adhere to these rules in carrying out their duties for the Fund.

         The Fund will, if appropriate, take action against any Covered Officer
whose actions are found to violate this Code. Sanctions for violations of the
Code may include, among other things, a requirement that the violator undergo
training related to the violation, a letter of sanction, the imposition of a
monetary penalty, and/or suspension or termination of the employment of the
violator. Where the Fund has suffered a loss because of violations of this Code
or applicable laws, regulations, or rules, it may pursue its remedies against
the individuals or entities responsible.

H.  RECORDKEEPING

         1.  General.

              The Fund requires accurate recording and reporting of information
         in order to make responsible business decisions. All of the Fund's
         books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in
         reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Fund's transactions
         and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the
         Fund's system of internal controls.

         2.  Code of Ethics Records.

              A copy of this Code, any amendments hereto, and any reports or
         other records created in relation to waivers of or amendments to
         provisions of this Code shall be kept as records of the Fund for six
         years from the end of the fiscal year in which such document was
         created. Such records shall be furnished to the SEC or its staff upon
         request.

I. AMENDMENTS TO THE CODE

         The Covered Officers and the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer are
encouraged to recommend improvements to this Code to the Board, and the Board
may amend the Code in its discretion. In connection with any amendment to the
Code, the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer shall prepare a brief description of
the amendment, in order that this description may be disclosed in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.

I, Daniel R. Omstead, certify that:

1.  I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of H&Q LIFE SCIENCES INVESTORS;

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of

    were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial

         a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
              supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known

              period in which this report is being prepared;
         b)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
              controls and procedures and presented in this report our
