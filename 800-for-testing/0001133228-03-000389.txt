R. JAY GERKEN, CFA

Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Shareholder,

As you know, the high-yield bond market has confronted its share of challenges
in recent years, including concerns about the economy, integrity of corporate
financial statements and the war, to name a few. Although it has recently
vacillated in reaction to a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields, the
high-yield market has made significant strides over the 12 months ended
September 30, 2003. Because the high-yield market is more closely linked to the
strength of corporate balance sheets than to interest rates, reports of
declining rates of defaults on bond payments and an improved corporate earnings
environment over the past year have contributed to the market's performance.

In this environment of four-decade-low money market yields, higher-yielding
bonds may seem to be even more appealing. Remember, however, that high-yield
bonds carry more credit risk than investment-grade issues. That is why it is
critical to perform a thorough analysis before carefully choosing these bonds.
In our opinion, this is all the more reason why investing in high-yield bonds
with a professional fund manager is a more prudent strategy than buying these
bonds directly. Fund managers can provide the diversification and thorough
credit analysis that is so important in managing risk.

As always, thank you for entrusting your assets to us. We look forward to
helping you continue to meet your financial goals.


Sincerely,


/s/ R. JAY GERKEN

================================================================================

Performance Review

During the 12 months ended September 30, 2003, the High Income Opportunity Fund
Inc. distributed dividends to shareholders totaling $0.68(i) per share. The
table below shows the 12-month total return based on the fund's September 30,
2003 net asset value ("NAV") per share and its New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
closing price.(ii) Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Based on NAV, the fund underperformed the average of its Lipper peer group of
high current yield (closed-end) funds, which returned 30.85%(iii), and its
unmanaged benchmark Citigroup High-Yield Market Index ("High-Yield Index"),(iv)
which returned 33.27%, for the same period. In our experience, it's not uncommon
for actively managed mutual funds to lag their unmanaged benchmarks during
periods of robust returns, such as during the last 12 months.

                 $7.08 (NAV)                             28.67%
                 $7.09 (NYSE)                            31.00%

High-Yield Market Review(vi)

Early last fall the market began to rally as default rates started to decline,
the economy appeared to be showing signs of improvement, and additional reports
of fraudulent corporate accounting activity diminished. The Fed's reduction of a
key short-term interest rate target to 1.25% in November further contributed to
the improved environment for high-yield securities at the time.

Despite weak equity markets, a struggling economy, the conflict with Iraq and
heightened concerns about North Korea's nuclear program, the high-yield market
continued to gain momentum throughout the first quarter of 2003. Early in the
second quarter after major combat operations in Iraq came to an end, the market
rally gained further momentum as companies reported first-quarter earnings, many
of which were in line with estimates and aided a recovering equity market. These
events, coupled with expectations during May that the Fed may cut its short-term
interest rate targets again, all helped buoy high-yield securities through
mid-June.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2                                                             2003 Annual Report
<PAGE>

Although the High-Yield Index recorded eight consecutive monthly increases from
last November through June, the bond markets in general performed less favorably
between the latter part of June through much of the summer. On June 25th, the
Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate(vii) by one-quarter of a
percentage point to a four-decade low of 1% to trigger a more accommodative
borrowing environment. Bond prices typically rise when interest rates are
expected to drop under the assumption that the yields on new bonds issued will
be lower than prevailing market yields, making outstanding bonds more valuable.
However, investors' reaction to the Fed's post-meeting statement suggesting that
additional rate cuts might not be needed, coupled with the fact that the market
had already partially factored a larger cut into bond prices, actually caused
the prices of bonds to retreat. The high-yield market lost ground between the
latter part of June into the middle of August as the prices of 10-year U.S.
Treasuries retreated and their yields soared from the low 3% range in mid-June
to almost 4.5% by the middle of August. These rising yields, the subsequent
outflows of cash from high-yield bond funds, and supply pressures due to the
over-abundant quantity of new issues on the market caused the high-yield market
to move lower during this time.

Toward the latter part of August, the market reversed course and rallied
through September as the prices of U.S. Treasury notes rose and yields dropped,
bottoming below 4% in September. During this time the momentum in the market
sparked the return of inflows into high-yield bond funds. As of the period's
close, the yield on the High-Yield Index exceeded 8.5%. While yields will
fluctuate, based upon this rate as of September's close, high-yield bonds
continued to offer very competitive yields relative to higher-rated bonds.

Analysis of High-Yield Fund Holdings

Rallying from distressed levels last year, bonds in the CCC credit range and
those falling into a variety of credit categories in the airlines, cable and
media, communications towers, energy, technology, telecommunications and
utilities sectors finished the period among the top performers in the High-Yield
Index. The fund benefited from its exposure to securities rated CCC. It also
benefited from its overweighted positions in the cable and media sector, which
it increased during the period, and from its overweighted exposure to the
communications towers and telecommunications sectors (it shifted from
underweight to overweight positions during the period.)

High Income Opportunity Fund Inc.                                              3
<PAGE>

However, the fund did not participate as strongly in the rally in the technology
sector, as it decreased its exposure to this industry during the period. The
fund's underweighted position in the utilities and energy sectors also detracted
from its performance. During the period, a particularly large number of bonds in
the utilities and energy sectors were added to the High-Yield Index. Although
the fund increased its exposure to the utilities and energy sectors during the
period, it remained underweighted in relation to this index, which detracted
from its relative performance.

As of September 30, 2003, the fund held underweight positions in the gaming,
healthcare, metals and mining and restaurants sectors. This approach proved
favorable given that these sectors were all among the underperformers during the
period. However, the fund remained overweighted in the textiles sector, which
also underperformed many other sectors.

<PAGE>

The information provided in this letter by the Manager is not intended to be a
forecast of future events, a guarantee of future results or investment advice.
Views expressed may differ from those of the firm as a whole.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of September 30, 2003 and are subject
to change. Please refer to pages 7 through 21 for a list and percentage
breakdown of the fund's holdings.

(i)   Includes a return of capital of $0.07 per share.
(ii)  NAV is a price that reflects the value of the fund's underlying portfolio.
      However, the price at which an investor may buy or sell shares of the fund
      is at the fund's market price as determined by supply of and demand for
      the fund's common shares.
(iii) Lipper is a major independent mutual-fund tracking organization. Average
      annual returns are based on the 12-month period ended September 30, 2003,
      calculated among five funds in the high current yield (closed-end) funds
      category with reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
(iv)  The High-Yield Index is a broad-based unmanaged index of high-yield
      securities. Please note that an investor cannot invest directly in an
      index.
(v)   Total returns are based on changes in NAV or the market price,
      respectively. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends
      and/or capital gains distributions in additional shares.
(vi)  Investments in high-yield securities and securities of foreign companies
      and governments, including emerging markets, involve risks beyond those
      inherent in solely higher-rated and domestic investments. The risks of
      high-yield securities include, but are not limited to, price volatility
      and the possibility of default in the timely payment of interest and
      principal. Foreign investments involve additional risks, including
      economic, political and social factors and currency fluctuations. These
      risks are magnified in emerging markets. These and other risks are more
      fully described in the prospectus. Derivatives, such as options and
      futures, can be illiquid and harder to value, especially in declining
      markets. A small investment in certain derivatives may have a potentially
      large impact on the fund's performance. Derivatives can disproportionately
      increase losses as stated in the prospectus.
(vii) The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks with excess
      reserves at a Federal Reserve district bank charge other banks that need
      overnight loans.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!

As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your dividends
and capital gains distributions, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below
is a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary

If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of common stock shares in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a cash
dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value ("NAV") per share on the
determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a price reflecting
the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than the NAV at the time of valuation (the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC Inc. ("Plan Agent") will buy common
stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the NAV previously
determined before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt to
terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95% of
the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will be
based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open
market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in the section of this
report beginning on page 37. To find out more detailed information about the
Plan and about how you can participate, please call PFPC Inc. at (800) 331-1710.

           Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
           strong.
AA      -- Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
           repay principal and differ from the highest rated issue only in a
           small degree.
A       -- Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
           principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
           effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
           bonds in higher rated categories.
BBB     -- Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
           interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate
           protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing
           circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay
           interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for
           bonds in higher rated categories.
BB, B,  -- Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC", "CC" and "C" are regarded, on balance,
CCC, CC    as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest
and C      and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.
           "BB" represents the lowest degree of speculation and "C" the highest
           degree of speculation. While such bonds will likely have some quality
           and protective characteristics, these are outweighed by large
           uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions.
D       -- Bonds rated "D" are in default, and payment of interest and/or
           repayment of principal is in arrears.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 may be
applied to each generic rating from "Aa" to "Caa", where 1 is the highest and 3
the lowest rating within its generic category.

Aa      -- Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
           Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are generally known
           as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because
           margins of protection may not be as large in "Aaa" securities or
           fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or
           there may be other elements present which make the long-term risks
           appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa" securities.
A       -- Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and are
           to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving
           security to principal and interest are considered adequate but
           elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment
           some time in the future.
Baa     -- Bonds rated "Baa" are considered to be medium grade obligations; that
           is, they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest
           payment and principal security appear adequate for the present but
           certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
           characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. These
           bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
           speculative characteristics as well.
Ba      -- Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
           future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of
           interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby not
           well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future.
           Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.
B       -- Bonds rated "B" generally lack characteristics of desirable
           investments. Assurance of interest and principal payments or
           maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of
           time may be small.
Caa     -- Bonds rated "Caa" are of poor standing. These issues may be in
           default, or there may be present elements of danger with respect to
           principal or interest.
Ca      -- Bonds rated "Ca" represent obligations which are speculative in a
           high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked
           shortcomings.
C       -- Bonds rated "C" are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
           rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever
           attaining any real investment standing.

NR      -- Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's or Moody's.

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The High Income Opportunity Fund Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company.

The significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund are: (a)
security transactions are accounted for on trade date; (b) securities are valued
at the mean between the quoted bid and asked prices provided by an independent
pricing service that are based on transactions in corporate obligations,
quotations from corporate bond dealers, market transactions in comparable
securities and various relationships between securities; securities listed on
the NASDAQ National Market System for which market quotations are available are
valued at the official closing price or, if there is no official closing price
on that day, at the last sale price; (c) securities for which market quotations
are not available will be valued in good faith at fair value by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors; (d) securities maturing within 60 days are
valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which
approximates value; (e) gains or losses on the sale of securities are calculated
by using the specific identification method; (f) dividend income is recorded on
the ex-dividend date; foreign dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend
date or as soon as practical after the Fund determines the existence of a
dividend declaration after exercising reasonable due diligence; (g) interest
income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is
recorded on an accrual basis; (h) dividends and distributions to shareholders
are recorded on the ex-dividend date; the Fund distributes dividends monthly and
capital gains, if any, at least annually; (i) the accounting records are
maintained in U.S. dollars. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of
such currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and
sales of securities, and income and expenses are translated at the rate of
exchange quoted on the respective date that such transactions are recorded.
Differences between income or expense amounts recorded and collected or paid are
adjusted when reported by the custodian bank; (j) the character of income and
gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations
which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. At September 30, 2003, reclassifications were made to the
capital accounts of the Fund to reflect permanent book/tax differences and
income and gains available for distributions under income tax regulations.
Accordingly, a portion of net realized losses amounting to $16,016,598 has been
reclassified to paid-in-capital. Net investment income, net realized gains and
net assets were not affected by this adjustment; (k) the Fund intends to comply
with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of

1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make
distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all
Federal income and excise taxes; and (l) estimates and assumptions are required
to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets resulting
from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the economic
environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

In addition, the Fund may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order
to hedge against foreign currency risk. These contracts are marked-to-market
daily by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the
current market rate as an unrealized gain or loss. Realized gains or losses are
recognized when contracts are settled or offset by entering into another forward
foreign exchange contract.

In addition, the Fund invests in high-yield instruments that are subject to
certain credit and market risks. The yields of high-yield debt obligations
reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's investment in
securities rated below investment grade typically involve risks not associated
with higher rated securities including, among others, greater risk of timely and
ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater market price volatility and
less liquid secondary market trading.

2. Management Agreement

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager of the Fund. The
Fund pays SBFM a management fee calculated at an annual rate of 1.15% of the
Fund's average daily net assets. This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

3. Investments

During the year ended September 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

================================================================================
Purchases                                                           $169,321,878

Net unrealized appreciation                                        $ 16,528,417
================================================================================

4. Repurchase Agreements

The Fund purchases (and the custodian takes possession of) U.S. government
securities from securities dealers subject to agreements to resell the
securities to the sellers at a future date, (generally, the next business
day),at an agreed-upon higher repurchase price. The Fund requires continual
maintenance of the market value (plus accrued interest) of the collateral in
amounts at least equal to the repurchase price.

5. Capital Shares

Capital stock transactions were as follows:

7. Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders

At September 30, 2003, the tax basis components of distributable earnings were:

================================================================================
Accumulated capital loss                                          $(361,790,511)

Unrealized appreciation                                              16,529,395
================================================================================

The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation
and depreciation is attributable to wash sales, treatment of accretion of
discounts and amortization of premiums and consent fees.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2003
was:

================================================================================
Ordinary income                                                      $44,735,429
Capital                                                                5,250,728

8. Subsequent Event

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue guarantee
agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor would
guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue Guarantee
Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the sub-contractor's
business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent (PFPC Inc.) used by
CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee Agreement was
amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements that included a
one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards

informed of the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when
that occurred.

CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
$16 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received from the
Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. CAM also plans an independent
review to verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were fairly priced
as compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new procedures and
making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are entered into in
the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determined.

The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

(1)   Per share amounts have been calculated using the monthly average shares
      method.
(2)   Effective October 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in the accounting
      method that requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all
      discounts. Without the adoption of this change, for the year ended
      September 30, 2002, the net investment income, net realized and unrealized
      loss and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets would
      have been $0.68, $0.98 and 10.13%, respectively. Per share information,
      ratios and supplemental data for the periods prior to October 1, 2001 have
      not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.
(3)   The total return calculation assumes that dividends are reinvested in
      accordance with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

Independent Auditors' Report
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of
High Income Opportunity Fund Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of High Income Opportunity Fund Inc. ("Fund") as of
September 30, 2003, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended and financial highlights for each of the years in the
five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of September 30, 2003, by correspondence with the custodian.
As to securities purchased or sold but not yet received or delivered, we
performed other appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Fund as of September 30, 2003, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the years in the
five-year period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

the Fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), as purchasing agent
under the Plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. Distributions
with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer or other
nominee (that is, in "street name") will be reinvested by the broker or nominee
in additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the
broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash.
Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult their
broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of PFPC as dividend
paying agent.

The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the Plan in
lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the market
price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value ("NAV") per
share of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the record date
for the distribution), the Plan participants will be issued shares of common
stock by the Fund at a price equal to the greater of NAV determined as described
below or 95% of the market price of the common stock.

If the market price of the common stock is less than the NAV of the common stock
at the time of valuation (which is the close of business on the determination
date) PFPC will buy common stock in the open market, on the stock exchange or
elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following the commencement of the
purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds
the NAV of the common stock as of the valuation time, PFPC will attempt to
terminate purchases in the open market and cause the Fund to issue the remaining
portion of the dividend or distribution in shares at a price equal to the
greater of (a) NAV as of the valuation time or (b) 95% of the then current
market price. In this case, the number of shares received by a Plan participant
will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the
open market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares. To the
extent PFPC is unable to stop open market purchases and cause the Fund to issue
the remaining shares, the average per share purchase price paid by PFPC may
exceed the NAV of the common stock as of the valuation time, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or capital gains distribution
had been paid in common stock issued by the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC
will begin to purchase common stock on the open market as soon as practicable
after the determination date for the dividend or capital gains distribution, but
in

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

no event shall such purchases continue later than 30 days after the payment date
for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for a succeeding dividend
or distribution, except when necessary to comply with applicable provisions of
the federal securities laws.

PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmation of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve Plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each Plan participant will be held
by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of each Plan participant.

Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and capital
gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the Fund. No brokerage
charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the Fund
under the Plan. Each Plan participant will, however, bear a proportionate share
of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with respect to any open market
purchases made under the Plan.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to Plan participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Global Inc., P.O. Box 8030, Boston,
Massachusetts 02266-8030 or by telephone at 1-800-331-1710.

                              --------------------

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, that from time to time the Fund may purchase,
at market prices, shares of its common stock in the open market.

EX 99.CODE ETH

                        SARBANES-OXLEY ACT CODE OF ETHICS
                           FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
      SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF CAM\U.S. REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES

I.    Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

      This code of ethics (the "Code") for Citigroup Asset Management's
("CAM's") U. S. registered proprietary investment companies (collectively,
"Funds" and each a, "Company") applies to each Company's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller
(the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
      apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
      relationships;

o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
      documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and
      Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
      Company;

o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
      person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   Administration of Code

      The Regional Director of CAM Compliance, North America ("Compliance
Officer") is responsible for administration of this Code, including granting
pre-approvals (see Section III below) and waivers (as described in Section VI
below), applying this Code in specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and interpreting this Code in any particular situation.

<PAGE>

III.  Covered Officers Should Ethically Handle Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
      Interest

      Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Company.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The compliance programs
and procedures of the Company and its investment adviser are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code (see Section VII
below).

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and a
Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of a Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Funds' Boards of Directors\Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may
also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered
by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

                                     * * * *

      Each Covered Officer must:

o     not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting (e.g. through
      fraudulent accounting

<PAGE>

      practices) by the Company whereby the Covered Officer(1) would benefit
      personally to the detriment of the Company; or

o     not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than for the
      benefit of the Company; and

o     not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
      contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to trade
      personally in contemplation of the market affect of such transactions.

o     There are some potential conflict of interest situations that should
      always be discussed with the Compliance Officer, if material. Examples are
      as follows:

            (1) service as a director on the board of any public or private
      company;

            (2) any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
      relationship with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its
      investment adviser,

            (3) a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
      transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio
      transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
      arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
      equity ownership; and

            4) the receipt of any gifts or the conveyance of any value
      (including entertainment) from any company with which the Company has
      current or prospective business dealings, except:

                  (a) any non-cash gifts of nominal value (nominal value is less
            than $100); and

                  (b) customary and reasonable meals and entertainment at which
            the giver is present, such as the occasional business meal or
            sporting event.

IV.   Disclosure and Compliance

Each Covered Officer:

o     should be familiar with his or her responsibilities in connection with the
      disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company;

- ----------------------------
(1)   Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
      Officer would also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
      of a Covered Officer's family (spouse, minor children and any account over
      which a Covered Officer is deemed to have beneficial interest) engages in
      such an activity or has such a relationship.

<PAGE>

o     should not knowingly misrepresent, or knowingly cause others to
      misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside
      the Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors, and to
      governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

o     should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
      responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and
      the investment adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
      timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
      Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications
      made by the Funds; and

o     is responsible to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
      imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.    Reporting and Accountability

      Each Covered Officer must:

o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that the Covered Officer
      has received, read, and understands the Code;

o     annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied with
      the requirements of the Code;

o     annually disclose affiliations and other relationships related to
      conflicts of interest;

o     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
      Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
      are made in good faith; and

o     notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he knows of any violation of
      this Code (failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code).

      In rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting
investigations of potential violations under the Code, the Compliance Officer
may, at his discretion, consult with such persons as he determines to be
appropriate, including, but not limited to, a senior legal officer of the
Company or its investment adviser or its affiliates, independent auditors or
other consultants, subject to any requirement to seek pre-approval from the
Company's audit committee for the retention of independent auditors to perform
permissible non-audit services. The Funds will follow these procedures in
investigating and enforcing the Code:

o     the compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate any
      potential violation of which he becomes aware;

o     if, after investigation the Compliance Officer believes that no violation
      has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take any further
      action;

<PAGE>

o     any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
      reported to the Directors of the Fund who are not "interested persons" as
      defined in the Investment Company Act the ("Non-interested Directors")

o     if the Non-interested Directors of the Board concur that a violation has
      occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include review
      of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
      notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
      board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer; and

o     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules

      The Compliance Officer shall submit an annual report to the Board
describing any waivers granted.

VI.   Waivers(2)

      A Covered Officer may request a waiver of any of the provisions of the
Code by submitting a written request for such waiver to the Compliance Officer,
setting forth the basis of such request and explaining how the waiver would be
consistent with the standards of conduct described herein. The Compliance
Officer shall review such request and make a determination thereon in writing,
which shall be binding.

      In determining whether to waive any provisions of this Code, the
Compliance Officer shall consider whether the proposed waiver is consistent with
honest and ethical conduct and other purposes of this Code.

VII.  Other Policies and Procedures

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code. The codes of ethics of the funds and the
investment advisers and principal underwriters under Rule 17j-1 of the
Investment Company Act and the Citigroup Code of Conduct and Citigroup Statement
of Business Practices as well as other policies of the Fund's investment
advisers or their affiliates are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

- ----------------------------
(2)   For purposes of this Code, Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the
      approval by a Company of a material departure from a provision of the
      Code" and includes an"implicit waiver," which means a Company's failure to
      take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material
      departure from a provision of the Code that has been made known to an
      executive officer of the Company.

<PAGE>

VIII. Amendments

      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B and C
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a
majority of Non-interested Directors.

IX.   Confidentiality

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board and Company and their
respective counsel, counsel to the non-Interested Directors or independent
auditors or other consultants referred to in Section V above.

X.    Internal Use

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

I, R. Jay Gerken, certify that:

1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of High Income Opportunity Fund
      Inc.;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
      information included in this report, fairly present in all material
      respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
      assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
      include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
      periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
      registrant and have:

      a)    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such

            registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
            fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
            materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

I, Richard L. Peteka, certify that:

1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of High Income Opportunity Fund
      Inc.;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial information included in this report,
      and the financial statements on which the financial information is based,
      fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
      of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows (if the financial
      statements are required to include a statement of cash flows) of the
      registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the
      registrant and have:

      a)    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
            registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
            to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
            period in which this report is being prepared;

      b)    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
            and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
            the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
            date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on
            such evaluation; and

      c)    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
            control over financial reporting that occurred during the
            registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
            fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
            materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      a)    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and

      b)    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
