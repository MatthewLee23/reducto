ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

The Report to Shareholders is attached herewith.



                                            (THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC. LOGO)

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2008

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers to certify the entire contents of the semi-annual and annual
shareholder reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification would cover the portfolio manager's commentary
and subjective opinions if they are attached to or a part of the financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

     Because we do not want our portfolio managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or restrict their commentary to historical facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to you separately. Both the commentary and the financial statements,
including the portfolio of investments, will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com.

     Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2008.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity Trust") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Maryland
corporation on May 20, 1986 and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), whose primary objective is long-term growth
of capital. Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

     The Equity Trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in equity
securities under normal market conditions (the "80% Policy"). The 80% Policy may
be changed without shareholder approval. The Equity Trust will provide
shareholders with notice at least 60 days prior to the implementation of any
changes in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION. Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's official closing price as of the close of business on the
day the securities are being valued. If there were no sales that day, the
security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if
there were no asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, the security is valued at the most recently available price or, if the
Board of Directors (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio securities primarily traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on the relevant
market, but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the Board
if market conditions change significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued.
Debt instruments with remaining maturities of 60 days or less that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost, unless the Board determines such
amount does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these
securities will be fair valued as determined by the Board. Debt instruments
having a maturity greater than 60 days for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked prices quoted on such day, the security is valued using the
closing bid price. Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board. Fair valuation methodologies and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial information about the company; comparisons with the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign securities with the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at
the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of any other information that
could be indicative of the value of the security.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements" ("SFAS 157") clarifies the definition of fair value for financial
reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires
additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157 are described below:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
          risk, etc.); and

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's
          determinations as to the fair value of investments).

     The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. The
summary of the Fund's investments and other financial instruments, by inputs
used to value the Fund's investments as of December 31, 2008 is, as follows:

     In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 161, "Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 161") that is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 is intended to
improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced
disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity uses
derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative instruments
affect an entity's results of operations and financial position. Management is
currently evaluating the implications of SFAS 161 on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary government securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System, or with other brokers or
dealers that meet credit guidelines established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the Fund to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
It is the policy of the Fund to always receive and maintain securities as
collateral whose market value, including accrued interest, are at least equal to
102% of the dollar amount invested by the Fund in each agreement. The Fund will
make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of
book entry transfer of the collateral to the account of the custodian. To the
extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of
the collateral is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of
the collateral. If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines
or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller of the
security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.
At December 31, 2008, there were no open repurchase agreements.

     INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES. The Fund may invest, from time
to time, in shares of other investment companies (or entities that would be
considered investment companies but are excluded from the definition pursuant to
certain exceptions under the 1940 Act) (the "Acquired Funds") in accordance with
the 1940 Act and related rules. As a shareholder in the Fund, you would bear the
pro rata portion of the periodic expenses of the Acquired Funds in addition to
the Fund's expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund's pro rata
portion of the periodic expenses charged by the Acquired Funds was less than one
basis point.

     OPTIONS. The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or indices. As a writer of put options, the Fund receives a premium at the
outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the
financial instrument underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the underlying financial instrument decreases between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain, to the extent of the premium, if the price of the financial
instrument increases between those dates. If a written call option is exercised,
the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying security in
determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a written put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security.

     As a purchaser of put options, the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put option the underlying security at a specified
price. The seller of the put has the obligation to purchase the underlying
security upon exercise at the exercise price. If the price of the underlying
security declines, the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise. If the
price of the underlying security increases or stays the same, the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at the expiration date, but only to the extent of
the premium paid.

     In the case of call options, these exercise prices are referred to as
"in-the-money", "at-the-money", and "out-of-the-money", respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying security will remain stable or decline during the option
period, (b) at-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the price of
the underlying security will remain stable, decline or advance moderately during
the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money call options when the Adviser
expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will be greater
than the appreciation in the price of the underlying security above the exercise
price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to profit from
any increase

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

in the market value of the underlying security above the exercise price of the
option. Out-of-the-money, at-the-money, and in-the-money put options (the
reverse of call options as to the relation of exercise price to market price)
may be utilized in the same market environments that such call options are used
in equivalent transactions. There were no open option contracts at December 31,
2008.

     SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into equity, contract for difference,
and interest rate swap or cap transactions. The use of swaps and caps is a
highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. A
swap agreement may involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and
counterparty risk and exposure to loss in excess of the related amounts
reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In an interest rate swap,
the Fund would agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap (which
is known as the "counterparty") periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange
for the counterparty agreeing to pay to the Fund periodically a variable rate
payment that is intended to approximate the Fund's variable rate payment
obligation on Series C Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock. In an
interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty and, to the
extent that a specified variable rate index exceeds a predetermined fixed rate,
would receive from that counterparty payments of the difference based on the
notional amount of such cap. In a swap, a set of future cash flows are exchanged
between two counterparties. One of these cash flow streams will typically be
based on a reference interest rate combined with the performance of a notional
value of shares of a stock. The other will be based on the performance of the
shares of a stock. Swap and cap transactions introduce additional risk because
the Fund would remain obligated to pay preferred stock dividends when due in
accordance with the Articles Supplementary even if the counterparty defaulted.
If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap contract, the Fund will be
limited to contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be
able to meet their obligations pursuant to a swap contract or that, in the event
of default, the Fund will succeed in pursuing contractual remedies. The Fund
thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining
payments owed to it pursuant to a swap contract. The creditworthiness of the
swap contract counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this
risk. Depending on the general state of short-term interest rates and the
returns on the Fund's portfolio securities at that point in time, such a default
could negatively affect the Fund's ability to make dividend payments. In
addition, at the time a swap or cap transaction reaches its scheduled
termination date, there is a risk that the Fund will not be able to obtain a
replacement transaction or that the terms of the replacement will not be as
favorable as on the expiring transaction.

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market and counterparty risk in excess of the amount recognized below.

     Unrealized gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
The change in value of swaps, including the accrual of periodic amounts of
interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as unrealized gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     At December 31, 2008, there were no open interest rate swap agreements.

     Effective March 16, 2008, Bear, Stearns International Limited entered into
a Guaranty Agreement with JPMorgan Chase & Co., whereby JPMorgan Chase & Co.
unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment of certain liabilities
of Bear, Stearns International Limited, including the current liabilities of
Bear, Stearns International Limited to the Fund. As of December 31, 2008, the
Fund held a contract for difference swap with Bear, Stearns International
Limited which is covered by the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Guaranty Agreement as of
the date of the report. Details of the swap at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the
value of securities it intends to purchase. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the
value of the contract, which are included in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and futures contracts. The Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging instrument. The change in value of futures contracts primarily
corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market. At December 31, 2008, there were no
open futures contracts.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the transaction is denominated or another currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward rate and are marked-to-market daily. The change in market value is
included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign
currency translations. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The use of forward foreign exchange contracts does not eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future. Although
forward foreign exchange contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency, they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the counterparties to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their contracts. At December 31, 2008, there were no open forward
foreign exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currencies, investments, and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, income, and expenses are
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. Unrealized gains and losses that result from changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities have been included
in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency
translations. Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from
changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment securities transactions, foreign
currency transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and
dividends recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually received.
The portion of foreign currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent sale trade date is
included in realized gain/loss on investments.

     FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers. Investing in securities of foreign issuers involves special risks not
typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The risks
include possible revaluation of currencies, the ability to repatriate funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political and economic developments. Moreover, securities of many foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable, based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its
net assets in securities for which the markets are illiquid. Illiquid securities
include securities the disposition of which is subject to substantial legal or
contractual restrictions. The sale of illiquid securities often requires more
time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other
selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on
national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets. Restricted
securities may sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not
subject to restrictions on resale. Securities freely saleable among qualified
institutional investors under special rules adopted by the SEC may be treated as
liquid if they satisfy liquidity standards established by the Board. The
continued liquidity of such securities is not as well assured as that of
publicly traded securities, and accordingly the Board will monitor their
liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted for on the trade date with realized gain or loss on investments
determined by using the identified cost method. Interest income (including
amortization of premium and accretion of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized using the
effective yield to maturity method. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date except for certain dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS AND INTEREST EXPENSE. When cash balances are
maintained in the custody account, the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits." When cash balances are
overdrawn, the Fund is charged an overdraft fee equal to 110% of the 90 day
Treasury Bill rate on outstanding balances. This amount, if any, would be
included in "interest expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions to common shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to shareholders are based on
income and capital gains as determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency transactions held by the Fund, timing differences, and
differing characterizations of distributions made by the Fund. Distributions
from net investment income include net

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

realized gains on foreign currency transactions. These book/tax differences are
either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are
permanent, adjustments are made to the appropriate capital accounts in the
period when the differences arise. Permanent differences were primarily due to
reclassifications of distributions and swap investments. These reclassifications
have no impact on the NAV of the Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
reclassifications were made to increase accumulated distributions in excess of
net investment income by $738,712 and decrease accumulated net realized loss on
investments, written options, futures contracts, swap contracts, and foreign
currency transactions by $738,405 with an offsetting adjustment to paid-in
capital.

     On June 28, 2007, the Fund contributed $67,695,672 in cash in exchange for
shares of the Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust, and on the same date
distributed such shares to holders of the Fund on record as of June 21, 2007 at
the rate of one share of the Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust for every
twenty shares of the Fund's common stock.

     Distributions to shareholders of the Fund's Series C Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock, 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E
Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, and 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred
Stock ("Cumulative Preferred Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are
determined as described in Note 5.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2008 and December 31, 2007 was as follows:

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its net investment company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

     At December 31, 2008, the Fund had net capital loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of $5,677,238 which are available to reduce future
required distributions of net capital gains to shareholders through 2016.

     At December 31, 2008, the difference between book basis and tax basis
unrealized depreciation was primarily due to deferral of losses from wash sales
for tax purposes and basis adjustments for investments in real estate investment
trusts and partnerships.

     As of December 31, 2008, the components of accumulated earnings/losses on a
tax basis were as follows:

     FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48") provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold
are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. In accordance with
FIN 48, management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions taken on the federal
and state income tax returns for all open tax years (the current and prior three
tax years) and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the
Fund's financial statements. Management's determination regarding FIN 48 may be
subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but
not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations, and
interpretations thereof.

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Fund has an investment
advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Adviser which provides
that the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee, computed weekly and paid monthly,
equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average weekly net
assets including the liquidation value of preferred stock. In accordance with
the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides a continuous investment program for
the Fund's portfolio and oversees the administration of all aspects of the
Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee
on the incremental assets attributable to the Cumulative Preferred Stock if the
total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund, including
distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction, does not exceed the stated
dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock for the year.

     The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or the corresponding swap rate of each
particular series of Cumulative Preferred Stock for the period. For the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares
did not exceed the stated dividend rate or the corresponding swap rate on any of
the series of Preferred Stock. Thus, management fees with respect to the
liquidation value of the preferred stock assets were reduced by $4,012,394.

     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund paid brokerage
commissions on security trades of $331,715 to Gabelli & Company, Inc. ("Gabelli
& Company"), an affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Fund paid or accrued $45,000 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     As per the approval of the Board, the Fund compensates officers who are
employed by the Fund, and are not employed by the Adviser (although the officers
may receive incentive based variable compensation from affiliates of the
Adviser) and pays its allocated portion of the cost of the Fund's Chief
Compliance Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund paid
$143,545, which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement of Operations.

     The Fund pays each Director who is not considered to be an affiliated
person an annual retainer of $12,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended
in person and $500 per telephonic meeting, and they are reimbursed for any out
of pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members
receive $1,000 per meeting attended. In addition, the Audit Committee Chairman
receives an annual fee of $3,000, the Proxy Voting Committee Chairman receives
an annual fee of $1,500, the Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual
fee of $2,000, and the Lead Director receives an annual fee of $1,000. Directors
who are directors or employees of the Adviser or an affiliated company receive
no compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the year ended December 31, 2008, other than short-term securities and U.S.
Government obligations, aggregated $211,346,272 and $316,095,409, respectively.

     Purchases and proceeds from the sales of U.S. Government obligations for
the year ended December 31, 2008, other than short-term obligations, aggregated
$127,500 and $127,031, respectively.

5. CAPITAL. The charter permits the Fund to issue 246,000,000 shares of common
stock (par value $0.001) and authorizes the Board to increase its authorized
shares from time to time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of its shares
on the open market when the shares are trading on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") at a discount of 10% or more (or such other percentage as the Board may
determine from time to time) from the NAV of the shares. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Fund did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in
the open market.

     The Fund's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance
of up to 18,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and results in the
financial leveraging of the common stock. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common shareholders. Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative. The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the Articles Supplementary to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect to the Cumulative Preferred Stock. If the Fund fails to meet these
requirements and does not correct such failure, the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the Series C Auction Rate, 5.875% Series D, Series E
Auction Rate, and 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock at redemption prices
of $25,000, $25, $25,000, and $25, respectively, per share plus an amount equal
to the accumulated and unpaid dividends whether or not declared on such shares
in order to meet these requirements. Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing
asset coverage requirements could restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends
to common shareholders and could lead to sales of portfolio securities at
inopportune times. The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner
unrelated to the fixed and variable rates, which could have either a beneficial
or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to common
shareholders.

     At the Fund's August 15, 2007 Board meeting, the Board approved the filing
of a shelf registration with the SEC, to give the Fund the ability to offer
additional preferred shares. The shelf registration was declared effective by
the SEC on March 20, 2008.

     On June 27, 2002, the Fund received net proceeds of $128,246,557 (after
underwriting discounts of $1,300,000 and offering expenses of $453,443) from the
public offering of 5,200 shares of Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock ("Series C Stock"). The dividend rate, as set by the auction process,
which is generally held every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term
interest rates. Since February 2008, the number of Series C Stock subject to bid
orders by potential holders has been less than the number of Series C Stock
subject to sell orders. Therefore, the weekly auctions have failed, and the
dividend rate has been the maximum rate. Holders that have submitted sell orders
have not been able to sell any or all of the Series C Stock for which they have
submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate is 150% of the "AA" Financial
Composite Commercial Paper Rate. The dividend rates of Series C Stock ranged
from 0.135% to 5.350% during the year ended December 31, 2008. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on each
auction date. Shareholders of Series C Stock may also trade their shares in the
secondary market. The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series C Stock in
whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Fund redeemed and retired 520 shares of Series C Stock.
Shareholders received the redemption price of $25,000 per share, which was equal
to the liquidation preference, together with any accumulated and unpaid
dividends, for each share redeemed. At December 31, 2008, 4,680 shares of Series
C Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of 0.300% and accrued
dividends amounted to $975.

     On October 7, 2003, the Fund received net proceeds of $72,375,842 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,362,500 and offering expenses of $261,658) from the
public offering of 3,000,000 shares of 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Stock ("Series D Stock"). Commencing October 7, 2008 and thereafter, the Fund,
at its option, may redeem the 5.875% Series D Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption price at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of Series
D Stock in the open market at prices less than the $25 liquidation value per
share. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund repurchased 48,431
shares of 6.00% Series D Stock in the open market at a cost of $977,750 and an
average discount of approximately 19.29% from its liquidation preference. All
6.00% Series D Stock repurchased have been retired. At December 31, 2008,
2,901,269 shares of 5.875% Series D Stock were outstanding and accrued dividends
amounted to $71,021.

     On October 7, 2003, the Fund received net proceeds of $49,350,009 (after
underwriting discounts of $500,000 and offering expenses of $149,991) from the
public offering of 2,000 shares of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock ("Series E Stock"). The dividend rate, as set by the auction process,
which is generally held every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term
interest rates. Since February 2008, the number of Series E Stock subject to bid
orders by potential holders has been less than the number of Series E Stock
subject to sell orders. Therefore, the weekly auctions have failed, and the
dividend rate has been the maximum rate. In that event, holders that have
submitted sell orders have not been able to sell any or all of the Series E
Stock for which they have submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate is
150% of the "AA" Financial Composite Commercial Paper Rate. The dividend rates
of Series E Stock ranged from 0.105% to 5.510% during the year ended December
31, 2008. Existing shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such
shares on each auction date. Shareholders of Series E Stock may also trade
shares in the secondary market. The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series E
Stock in whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Fund redeemed and retired 200 shares of Series E
Stock.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Shareholders received the redemption price of $25,000 per share, which was equal
to the liquidation preference, together with any accumulated and unpaid
dividends, for each share redeemed. At December 31, 2008, 1,800 shares of Series
E Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of 0.150% and accrued
dividends amounted to $1,125.

     On November 10, 2006, the Fund received net proceeds of $144,765,000 (after
underwriting discounts of $4,725,000 and estimated offering expenses of
$510,000) from the public offering of 6,000,000 shares of 6.20% Series F
Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series F Stock"). Commencing November 10, 2011 and
thereafter, the Fund, at its option, may redeem the 6.20% Series F in whole or
in part at the redemption price at any time. The Board has authorized the
repurchase of Series F Stock in the open market at prices less than the $25
liquidation value per share. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund
repurchased and retired 79,734 shares of Series F Stock in the open market at a
cost of $1,652,658 and an average discount of approximately 13.93% from its
liquidation preference. At December 31, 2008, 5,920,266 shares of Series F Stock
were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $152,940.

     The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class. The
holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock voting together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Directors and under certain circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. In addition, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class, voting separately, of the
Fund's outstanding voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end to an open-end investment company. The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding preferred stock and a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's outstanding voting securities are
required to approve certain other actions, including changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS. The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7. OTHER MATTERS. On April 24, 2008, the Adviser entered into an administrative
settlement with the SEC to resolve the SEC's inquiry regarding prior frequent
trading activity in shares of the GAMCO Global Growth Fund (the "Global Growth
Fund") by one investor who was banned from the Global Growth Fund in August
2002. In the settlement, the SEC found that the Adviser had violated Section
206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act, and Rule
17d-1 thereunder and had aided and abetted and caused violations of Section
12(d)(1)(B)(i) of the 1940 Act. Under the terms of the settlement, the Adviser,
while neither admitting nor denying the SEC's findings and allegations, agreed,
among other things, to pay the previously reserved total of $16 million
(including a $5 million penalty), of which at least $11 million will be
distributed to shareholders of the Global Growth Fund in accordance with a plan
to be developed by an independent distribution consultant and approved by the
independent directors of the Global Growth Fund and the staff of the SEC and to
cease and desist from future violations of the above referenced federal
securities laws. The settlement is not expected to impact the Fund and will not
have a material adverse impact on the Adviser or its ability to fulfill its
obligations under the Advisory Agreement. On the same day, the SEC filed a civil
action against the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the
Adviser, alleging violations of certain federal securities laws arising from the
same matter. The officer is also an officer of the Global Growth Fund and other
funds in the Gabelli/GAMCO fund complex including the Fund. The officer denies
the allegations and is continuing in his positions with the Adviser and the
funds. The Adviser currently expects that any resolution of the action against
the officer will not have a material adverse impact on the Adviser or its
ability to fulfill its obligations under the Advisory Agreement.

     In a separate matter, on January 12, 2009, the SEC issued an administrative
action approving a final settlement of a previously disclosed matter with the
Adviser involving compliance with Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of
1940 and Rule 19a-1 thereunder by two closed-end funds. These provisions require
registered investment companies when making a distribution in the nature of a
dividend from sources other than net investment income to contemporaneously
provide written statements to shareholders, which adequately disclose the source
or sources of such distribution. While the two funds sent annual statements and
provided other materials containing this information, the shareholders did not
receive the notices required by Rule 19a-1 with any of the distributions that
were made for 2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that the funds have been in
compliance with Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 since the beginning of 2004. As
part of the settlement, in which the Adviser neither admits nor denies the
findings by the SEC, the Adviser agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of
$450,000 and to cease and desist from causing violations of Section 19(a) and
Rule 19a-1. In connection with the settlement, the SEC noted the remedial
actions previously undertaken by the Adviser. The staff's notice to the Adviser
did not relate to the Fund.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.
(hereafter referred to as the "Trust") at December 31, 2008, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2008 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

AUCTION RATE SERIES C AND E CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

     Auction Rate Preferred Stock pays dividends weekly based on a rate set at
auction, usually held every seven days. There were no 2008 distributions derived
from long-term capital gains for the Auction Rate Series C and Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock.

     A Form 1099-DIV has been mailed to all shareholders of record which sets
forth specific amounts to be included in the 2008 tax returns. Ordinary income
distributions include net investment income and realized net short-term capital
gains, if any. Ordinary income is reported in box 1a of Form 1099-DIV. Capital
gain distributions are reported in box 2a of Form 1099-DIV. There were no
long-term gain distributions for the year ended December 31, 2008.

CORPORATE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION, QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME, AND U.S.
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INCOME

     In 2008, the Fund paid to common, 5.875% Series D, and 6.200% Series F
cumulative preferred shareholders ordinary income totaling $0.01000, $1.46875,
and $1.55000 per share, respectively. The Fund paid weekly distributions to
auction rate Series C and Series E cumulative preferred shareholders at varying
rates throughout the year, including an ordinary income dividend totaling
$760.66000 and $783.29000 per share, respectively, in 2008. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, 94.57% of the ordinary income dividend qualified for the
dividend received deduction available to corporations, and 100% of the ordinary
income distribution was deemed qualified dividend income and is reported in box
1b on Form 1099-DIV. The percentage of the ordinary income dividends paid by the
Fund during 2008 derived from U.S. Government securities was 0.33%. Such income
is exempt from state and local tax in all states. However, many states,
including New York and California, allow a tax exemption for a portion of the
income earned only if a mutual fund has invested at least 50% of its assets at
the end of each quarter of the Fund's fiscal year in U.S. Government securities.
The Fund did not meet this strict requirement in 2008. The percentage of net
assets of U.S. Government securities held as of December 31, 2008 was 5.00%.

     The Annual Meeting of The Gabelli Equity Trust's shareholders will be held
     on Monday, May 18, 2009 at the Greenwich Library in Greenwich, Connecticut.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                       AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

     It is the  policy  of  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust  Inc.  (the  "Fund")  to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to credit shares of common stock to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a
capital  gains  distribution  regardless  of whether the shares are trading at a
discount or a premium to net asset  value.  All  distributions  to  shareholders
whose shares are registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested
pursuant to the Plan in additional  shares of the Fund.  Plan  participants  may
send  their  stock   certificates   to   Computershare   Trust   Company,   N.A.
("Computershare") to be held in their dividend reinvestment account.  Registered
shareholders  wishing to receive  their  distribution  in cash must  submit this
request in writing to:

                         The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.
                               c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                           Providence, RI 02940-3010

     Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan, may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

     If your  shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  reregistered  in your own name.
Once  registered  in  your  own  name  your  dividends  will  be   automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

     The number of shares of common stock  distributed  to  participants  in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner.  Under the
Plan,  whenever  the  market  price of the  Fund's  common  stock is equal to or
exceeds  net  asset  value  at the  time  shares  are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of common stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Fund's common stock.  The valuation date is
the  dividend or  distribution  payment  date or, if that date is not a New York
Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE")  trading  day,  the next trading day. If the net asset
value of the common stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds the market price of
the common  stock,  participants  will  receive  shares  from the Fund valued at
market  price.   If  the  Fund  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution  payable only in cash,  Computershare  will buy common stock in the
open market, or on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts, except
that Computershare  will endeavor to terminate  purchases in the open market and
cause the Fund to issue shares at net asset value if, following the commencement
of such purchases, the market value of the common stock exceeds the then current
net asset value.

     The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends  and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

     The  Voluntary   Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase their  investment in the Fund. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

     Participants  in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's shares
at the then current market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from $250 to
$10,000.  Computershare  will use  these  funds to  purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will  charge
each shareholder who participates  $0.75, plus a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary cash payments be sent to Computershare, P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010 such that Computershare  receives such payments approximately 10 days
before  the 1st and 15th of the  month.  Funds not  received  at least five days
before the investment date shall be held for investment  until the next purchase
date.  A payment  may be  withdrawn  without  charge if  notice is  received  by
Computershare at least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

     SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE  must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your request your name,  address,  and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

     For more information regarding the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Fund.

     The Fund  reserves the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by  Computershare  on at least 90 days written
notice to participants in the Plan.

         Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. The Audit Committee ("Committee")
         of the registrant is responsible for pre-approving (i) all audit and
         permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent
         registered public accounting firm to the registrant and (ii) all
         permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent
         registered public accounting firm to the Adviser, Gabelli Funds, LLC,
         and any affiliate of Gabelli Funds, LLC ("Gabelli") that provides
         services to the registrant (a "Covered Services Provider") if the
         independent registered public accounting firm's engagement related
         directly to the operations and financial reporting of the registrant.
         The Committee may delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such
         audit and permissible non-audit services to the Chairperson of the
         Committee, and the Chairperson must report to the Committee, at its
         next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairperson's pre-approval
         of such services, his or her decision(s). The Committee may also
         establish detailed pre-approval policies and procedures for
         pre-approval of such services in accordance with applicable laws,
         including the delegation of some or all of the Committee's pre-approval
         responsibilities to the other persons (other than Gabelli or the
         registrant's officers). Pre-approval by the Committee of any
         permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the
         permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the registrant at
         the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (ii) such
         services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and
         approved by the Committee or Chairperson prior to the completion of the
         audit.

(e)(2)   The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
         (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to
         paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                           (b) 100%

                           (c) 100%

                           (d) N/A

     (f) The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
         other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
         was zero percent (0%).
<PAGE>

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
         investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of the
         registrant was $0 for 2007 and $0 for 2008.

     (h) The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
         considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
         rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
         sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
         entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
         investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
         that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
         accountant's independence.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

following members: Anthony J. Colavita, Anthony R Pustorino and Salvatore J.
Zizza.


ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

     (a) Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the
         close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
         shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

     (b) Not applicable.



ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS


         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt written policies and procedures governing the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Asset Management Inc., Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities, Inc., and Teton Advisors, Inc. (collectively,
the "Advisers") to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the Advisers; the principal underwriter; or any affiliated person of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the Advisers do not have voting discretion or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific guidelines or procedures supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

         The Proxy Voting Committee was originally formed in April 1989 for the
purpose of formulating guidelines and reviewing proxy statements within the
parameters set by the substantive proxy voting guidelines originally published
in 1988 and updated periodically, a copy of which are appended as Exhibit A. The
Committee will include representatives of Research, Administration, Legal, and
the Advisers. Additional or replacement members of the Committee will be
nominated by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire Committee.

           Meetings are held as needed basis to form views on the manner in
which the Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

         In general, the Director of Proxy Voting Services, using the Proxy
Guidelines, recommendations of Institutional Shareholder Corporate Governance
Service ("ISS"), other third-party services and the analysts of Gabelli &
Company, Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the recommendations of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines; or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of Directors but is consistent with the Proxy Guidelines. In those
instances, the Director of Proxy Voting Services or the Chairman of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy statement indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters identified by the Chairman of the Committee, the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as controversial, taking into
account the recommendations of ISS or other third party services and the
analysts of Gabelli & Company, Inc., will be presented to the Proxy Voting
Committee. If the Chairman of the Committee, the Director of Proxy Voting
Services or the Legal Department has identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial; (2) would benefit from deliberation by the Proxy Voting
Committee; or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest between the Advisers
and their clients, the Chairman of the Committee will initially determine what
vote to recommend that the Advisers should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         A.       CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

                  The Advisers have implemented these proxy voting procedures in
                  order to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing their
                  proxy voting decisions. By following the Proxy Guidelines, as
                  well as the recommendations of ISS, other third-party services
                  and the analysts of Gabelli & Company, the Advisers are able
                  to avoid, wherever possible, the influence of potential
                  conflicts of interest. Nevertheless, circumstances may arise
                  in which one or more of the Advisers are faced with a conflict
                  of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in
                  connection with its vote. In general, a conflict of interest
                  may arise when an Adviser knowingly does business with an
                  issuer, and may appear to have a material conflict between its
                  own interests and the interests of the shareholders of an
                  investment company managed by one of the Advisers regarding
                  how the proxy is to be voted. A conflict also may exist when
                  an Adviser has actual knowledge of a material business
                  arrangement between an issuer and an affiliate of the Adviser.

                  In practical terms, a conflict of interest may arise, for
                  example, when a proxy is voted for a company that is a client
                  of one of the Advisers, such as GAMCO Asset Management Inc. A
                  conflict also may arise when a client of one of the Advisers
                  has made a shareholder proposal in a proxy to be voted upon by
                  one or more of the Advisers. The Director of Proxy Voting
                  Services, together with the Legal Department, will scrutinize
                  all proxies for these or other situations that may give rise
                  to a conflict of interest with respect to the voting of
                  proxies.

         B.       OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

                  For matters submitted to the Committee, each member of the
                  Committee will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the
                  proxy statement, any relevant third party research, a summary
                  of any views provided by the Chief Investment Officer and any
                  recommendations by Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts. The Chief
                  Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts may
                  be invited to present their viewpoints. If the Director of
                  Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department believe that the
                  matter before the committee is one with respect to which a
                  conflict of interest may exist between the Advisers and their
                  clients, counsel will provide an opinion to the Committee
                  concerning the conflict. If the matter is one in which the
                  interests of the clients of one or more of Advisers may
                  diverge, counsel will so advise and the Committee may make
                  different recommendations as to different clients. For any
                  matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
                  counsel will provide an opinion concerning the likely risks
                  and merits of such an appraisal action.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         Each matter submitted to the Committee will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting. Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee, the Chairman of
the Committee will cast the deciding vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy Guidelines express the normal preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee meetings will be maintained. The Advisers subscribe to
ISS, which supplies current information on companies, matters being voted on,
regulations, trends in proxy voting and information on corporate governance
issues.

         If the vote cast either by the analyst or as a result of the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the issuer, the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine whether an amendment to the most recently filed Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II.      SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies, they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department. This is the responsibility of the investment professional or
sales assistant for the client. In accordance with Department of Labor
guidelines, the Advisers' policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan participants with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote shares held on behalf of the client in a manner consistent with any
individual investment/voting guidelines provided by the client. Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III.     CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any change in voting authority, the following should be notified by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

                                       3
<PAGE>

         In the event that the Board of Directors (or a Committee thereof) of
one or more of the investment companies managed by one of the Advisers has
retained direct voting control over any security, the Proxy Voting Department
will provide each Board Member (or Committee member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.      VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients. The Advisers will supply information on how
an account voted its proxies upon request.

         A letter is sent to the custodians for all clients for which the
Advisers have voting responsibility instructing them to forward all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The sales assistant sends the letters to the custodians along with the
trading/DTC instructions. Proxy voting records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.       VOTING PROCEDURES

1. Custodian banks, outside brokerage firms and clearing firms are responsible
for forwarding proxies directly to the Advisers.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote Authorization Forms ("VAFs") - Issued by Broadridge
     Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") VAFs must be voted through the
     issuing institution causing a time lag. Broadridge is an outside service
     contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.

o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon receipt of the proxy, the number of shares each form represents is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In the case of a discrepancy such as an incorrect number of shares, an
improperly signed or dated card, wrong class of security, etc., the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are made to insure that a proper proxy is received in time to be voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

                                       4
<PAGE>

4. Upon receipt of instructions from the proxy committee (see Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Records have been maintained on the Proxy Edge system. The system is backed up
regularly.

Proxy Edge records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue


5. VAFs are kept alphabetically by security. Records for the current proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming season, files are transferred to an offsite storage facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote Authorization Forms issued by Broadridge are always sent
directly to a specific individual at Broadridge.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received too late to be voted in the conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to Broadridge up until the time of the meeting. This is
     followed up by mailing the original form.

o    When a solicitor has been retained, the solicitor is called. At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy contest, records are maintained for each opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be necessary to vote the shares in person. In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o     Banks and brokerage firms using the services at Broadridge:

      The back of the VAF is stamped indicating that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent overnight to Broadridge. Broadridge issues individual
legal proxies and sends them back via overnight (or the Adviser can pay
messenger charges). A lead-time of at least two weeks prior to the meeting is
needed to do this. Alternatively, the procedures detailed below for banks not
using Broadridge may be implemented.

                                       5
<PAGE>

o     Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

      The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal proxies are given to the person attending the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A limited Power of Attorney appointing the attendee an Adviser
     representative.

o    A list of all shares being voted by custodian only. Client names and
     account numbers are not included. This list must be presented, along with
     the proxies, to the Inspectors of Elections and/or tabulator at least
     one-half hour prior to the scheduled start of the meeting. The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e. determine if the vote have previously been
     cast, if the votes have been rescinded, etc. vote have previously been
     cast, etc.).

o    A sample ERISA and Individual contract.

o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.

o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES





GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our clients. As we state in our Magna Carta of Shareholders Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST management. We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy committee meeting in 1989, it was decided that each proxy
statement should be evaluated on its own merits within the framework first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders Rights. The attached guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not consider any issue routine. We take into consideration all of our
research on the company, its directors, and their short and long-term goals for
the company. In cases where issues that we generally do not approve of are
combined with other issues, the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

                                       7
<PAGE>


BOARD OF DIRECTORS


The advisers do not consider the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Historical responsiveness to shareholders
        This may include such areas as:
        -Paying greenmail
        -Failure to adopt shareholder resolutions receiving a majority of
         shareholder votes
o    Qualifications
o    Nominating committee in place
o    Number of outside directors on the board
o    Attendance at meetings
o    Overall performance


SELECTION OF AUDITORS


In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for auditors.



BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK


We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check preferred stock allows the company to issue stock and establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.



CLASSIFIED BOARD


A classified board is one where the directors are divided into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified board promotes continuity of directors facilitating long
range planning, we feel directors should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case basis taking into
consideration the board's historical responsiveness to the rights of
shareholders.

                                       8
<PAGE>

Where a classified board is in place we will generally not support attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an annually elected board is in place, we generally will not support
attempts to classify the board.



INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK


The request to increase the amount of outstanding shares is considered on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Future use of additional shares
        -Stock split
        -Stock option or other executive compensation plan
        -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet
        -Aid in restructuring
        -Improve credit rating
        -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o    Amount of stock currently authorized but not yet issued or reserved for
     stock option plans
o    Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and verifiable plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.


CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT


We support the idea that a shareholder's identity and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

                                       9
<PAGE>


CUMULATIVE VOTING


In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total number for one candidate or allocate the voting among two or more
candidates.

Where cumulative voting is in place, we will vote against any proposal to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board. When a proposal is made to institute cumulative voting, the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all shareholders, cumulative voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.



DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION


We support efforts to attract the best possible directors by limiting the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.


EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY


The SEC's rules provide for shareholder resolutions. However, the resolutions
are limited in scope and there is a 500 word limit on proponents' written
arguments. Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the proxy, we would look at such variables as length of time required to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.


FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS


Charter provisions requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

                                       10
<PAGE>

We support fair price provisions because we feel all shareholders should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



GOLDEN PARACHUTES


Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure management of its own welfare so that
they may continue to make decisions in the best interest of the company and
shareholders even if the decision results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes. Therefore, each proposal will be
decided on a case-by-case basis.

NOTE: CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.



ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS


We do not support greenmail. An offer extended to one shareholder should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.



LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS


We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.


CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER


This proposal releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

                                       11
<PAGE>

As a fiduciary, we are obligated to vote in the best economic interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that. Therefore, we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS


Each of the above is considered on a case-by-case basis. According to the
Department of Labor, we are not required to vote for a proposal simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.



MILITARY ISSUES


Shareholder proposals regarding military production must be evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients. As such, decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients, we will vote according to
the client's direction when applicable. Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.


NORTHERN IRELAND


Shareholder proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the discrimination of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients. As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients, we will vote according to
client direction when applicable. Where no direction has been given, we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

                                       12
<PAGE>

OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW


This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's takeover statutes. Example: Delaware law requires that a buyer must
acquire at least 85% of the company's stock before the buyer can exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider this on a case-by-case basis. Our decision will be based on the
following:

o    State of Incorporation
o    Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o    Other mitigating factors



POISON PILL


In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.



REINCORPORATION


Generally, we support reincorporation for well-defined business reasons. We
oppose reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent anti-takeover statutes that may negatively impact
the value of the stock.


STOCK OPTION PLANS


Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract, hold and motivate directors
and employees. However, each stock option plan must be evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o    Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o    Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o    Method of payment
o    Amount of stock already authorized but not yet issued under existing stock
     option plans

                                       13
<PAGE>

SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS


Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often exceed the average level of shareholder participation. We support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.


LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT


Written consent allows shareholders to initiate and carry on a shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting. It permits action to be taken by the written consent of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect proposed action at a
shareholder meeting.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

As reflected above, the Portfolio Managers manage accounts in addition to the
Trust. Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio
Manager also has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED TIME AND ATTENTION. As indicated above, the Portfolio
Managers manage multiple accounts. As a result, they will not be able to devote
all of their time to management of the Trust. The Portfolio Manager, therefore,
may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally
attractive investment opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the
case if he were to devote all of his attention to the management of only the
Trust.

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. As indicated above, the
Portfolio Managers manage managed accounts with investment strategies and/or
policies that are similar to the Trust. In these cases, if he identifies an
investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple accounts, a Fund may
not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity because the opportunity
may be allocated among all or many of these accounts or other accounts managed
primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser, and their affiliates. In
addition, in the event the Portfolio Manager determines to purchase a security
for more than one account in an aggregate amount that may influence the market
price of the security, accounts that purchased or sold the security first may
receive a more favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions.
<PAGE>


SELECTION OF BROKER/DEALERS. Because of Mr. Gabelli's position with the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor, he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute portfolio transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING STRATEGIES. At times, the Portfolio Manager may determine
that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the accounts
for which he exercises investment responsibility, or may decide that certain of
the funds or accounts should take differing positions with respect to a
particular security. In these cases, he may execute differing or opposite
transactions for one or more accounts which may affect the market price of the
security or the execution of the transaction, or both, to the detriment of one
or more other accounts.

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION. A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other benefits available to the Portfolio Managers differ among the accounts
that they manage. If the structure of the Adviser's management fee or the
Portfolio Manager's compensation differs among accounts (such as where certain
accounts pay higher management fees or performance-based management fees), the
Portfolio Manager may be motivated to favor certain accounts over others. The
Portfolio Manager also may be motivated to favor accounts in which he has an
investment interest, or in which the Adviser, or their affiliates have
investment interests. Similarly, the desire to maintain assets under management
or to enhance a Portfolio Manager's performance record or to derive other
rewards, financial or otherwise, could influence the Portfolio Manager in
affording preferential treatment to those accounts that could most significantly
benefit the Portfolio Manager. For example, as reflected above, if the Portfolio
Manager manages accounts which have performance fee arrangements, certain
portions of his compensation will depend on the achievement of performance
milestones on those accounts. The Portfolio Manager could be incented to afford
preferential treatment to those accounts and thereby by subject to a potential
conflict of interest.

The Adviser, and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser and their staff members. However, there is no guarantee that such
policies and procedures will be able to detect and prevent every situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR MARIO J. GABELLI

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined by deducting from gross investment management fees the firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's compensation) allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have arrangements whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee attributable to the liquidation value of outstanding preferred
stock (and Mr. Gabelli would only receive his percentage of such advisory fee)
if certain performance levels are met. Additionally, he receives similar
incentive based variable compensation for managing other accounts within the
firm and its affiliates. This method of compensation is based on the premise
that superior long-term performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation
and net investment activity. The level of compensation is not determined with
specific reference to the performance of any account against any specific
benchmark. One of the other registered investment companies managed by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his compensation
is adjusted up or down based on the performance of the investment company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance fees.
Compensation for managing these accounts has two components. One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account. The second component is based on absolute performance of the account,
with respect to which a percentage of such performance fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli. As an executive officer of the Adviser's parent company, GBL, Mr.
Gabelli also receives ten percent of the net operating profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.
<PAGE>

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR CAESAR M. P. BRYAN

The compensation of Mr. Bryan for the Trust is structured to enable the Adviser
to attract and retain highly qualified professionals in a competitive
environment. The Portfolio Manager receives a compensation package that includes
a minimum draw or base salary, equity-based incentive compensation via awards of
stock options, and incentive based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenue received by the Adviser for managing the Trust to the extent that
the amount exceeds a minimum level of compensation. Net revenues are determined
by deducting from gross investment management fees certain of the firm's
expenses (other than the Portfolio Managers' compensation) allocable to the
Trust (the incentive-based variable compensation for managing other accounts is
also based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for
managing the account). This method of compensation is based on the premise that
superior long-term performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded with
higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation and net
investment activity. The level of equity-based incentive and incentive-based
variable compensation is based on an evaluation by the Adviser's parent, GBL, of
quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation criteria. This evaluation
takes into account, in a broad sense, the performance of the accounts managed by
the Portfolio Manager, but the level of compensation is not determined with
specific reference to the performance of any account against any specific
benchmark. Generally, greater consideration is given to the performance of
larger accounts and to longer term performance over smaller accounts and
short-term performance.

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES IN THE FUND

Mario Gabelli and Caesar M. P. Bryan owned over $1,000,000 and $0 - $10,000,
respectively, of shares of the Trust as of December 31, 2008.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each affiliated registered investment company (each a
"Company") is committed to conducting business in accordance with applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate disclosure -- financial and otherwise -- in compliance with
applicable law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to each Company's Chief
Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons

ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that encourages the internal reporting of compliance concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics recognizes that the Senior Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies, because the Senior Officers currently or may in the future serve as
Senior Officers of each of the Companies, as officers or employees of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "Advisor")
and/or affiliates of the Advisor (the "Advisory Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors of other registered investment companies and unregistered
investment funds advised by the Advisory Group. This Code of Ethics also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and procedures adopted by, the Companies or the Advisory Group govern your
conduct in connection with many of the conflict of interest situations that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

                o the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the rules and
                  regulation promulgated thereunder by the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 Act");

                o the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the rules and
                  regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission (the "Advisers Act");

                o the Code of Ethics adopted by each Company pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act (collectively, the "Trust's 1940
                  Act Code of Ethics");

                                       1
<PAGE>

                o one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been reviewed and approved by those trustees/directors
                  (the "Directors") of each Company that are not "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "Independent Directors") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the "Advisory Group's 1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics" and, together with such Company's 1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 Act Codes of Ethics");

                o the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3, Rule 17a-7 and Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act
                  (collectively, the "Conflict Policies"); and

                o the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other things, conflict of interest situations and related
                  matters (collectively, the "Advisory Policies").

The provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the Conflict Policies and the Advisory Policies are referred to herein
collectively as the "Additional Conflict Rules".

                  This Code of Ethics is different from, and is intended to
supplement, the Additional Conflict Rules. Accordingly, a violation of the
Additional Conflict Rules by a Senior Officer is hereby deemed not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior Officer has a responsibility to each Company to
act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

                o act with integrity, including being honest and candid while
                  still maintaining the confidentiality of information where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

                o comply with the laws, rules and regulations that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's operations and report any suspected
                  violations thereof in accordance with the section below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

                o adhere to a high standard of business ethics.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior Officers are expected to use objective and unbiased
standards when making decisions that affect each Company, keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain inherent conflicts of interest because
Senior Officers of a Company also are or may be officers of other Companies
and/or the Advisory Group (as a result of which it is incumbent upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships. When making
any investment, accepting any position or benefits, participating in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest with respect to each Company where
you are receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior Officer of a Company, you should make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the Advisory Group (the "CCO") and obtain the approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

                o the receipt of any entertainment or non-nominal gift by the
                  Senior Officer, or a member of his or her family, from any
                  company with which a Company has current or prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

                o any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

                o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Senior Officer's
                  employment by the Advisory Group, such as compensation or
                  equity ownership.

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations in all reports and documents that such Company files with, or
submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission or a national securities
exchange and in all other public communications made by such Company. As a
Senior Officer, you are required to promote compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company's standards, policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:
                o familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure
                  requirements applicable to each Company as well as the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

                o not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent auditors, such Company's counsel,
                  any counsel to the Independent Directors, governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must report that information on a timely basis to the CCO or report it
anonymously by following the "whistle blower" policies adopted by the Advisory
Group from time to time. NO ONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION BECAUSE OF A GOOD
FAITH REPORT OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION.

                  Each Company will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

                o the CCO will take all appropriate action to investigate any
                  actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

                o violations and potential violations will be reported to the
                  Board of Directors of each affected Company after such
                  investigation;

                o if the Board of Directors determines that a violation has
                  occurred, it will take all appropriate disciplinary or
                  preventive action; and

                o appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a
                  letter of censure, suspension, dismissal or, in the event of
                  criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of
                  the Securities and Exchange Commission or other appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities.

questions are presented to the CCO and has the authority to interpret this Code
of Ethics in any particular situation. The CCO shall take all action he or she
considers appropriate to investigate any actual or potential violations reported

Form N-CSR, or otherwise, as provided by Securities and Exchange Commission
rules.

less than six (6) years from the date an action is taken, the first two (2)
years in an easily accessible place, a copy of the information or materials
supplied to the Boards of Directors pursuant to this Code of Ethics:

                o that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver to this
                  Code of Ethics; and

                o relating to any violation of this Code of Ethics and sanctions

                  the approval or action taken by the relevant Board of
                  Directors.

Trustees and their counsel, the Companies and their counsel, the Advisory Group
and its counsel and any other advisors, consultants or counsel retained by the
