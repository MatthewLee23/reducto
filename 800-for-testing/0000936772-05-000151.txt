Semi-Annual Report
This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund (the "Fund") for the semi-annual reporting
period ended April 30, 2005. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under
the New York Stock Exchange symbol "AFB".

Investment Objective and Policies
The Fund is a closed-end management investment company designed for investors
who seek high current income exempt from regular federal income tax. Under
normal conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80%, and normally
substantially all, of its assets in municipal securities paying interest that
is exempt from regular federal income tax. In addition, the Fund normally
invests at least 75% of its assets in investment grade municipal securities.
For more information regarding the Fund's risks, please see "A Word About Risk"
on page 3 and "Note G-Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to
Financial Statements on page 25.

Investment Results
The table on page 4 provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended April 30, 2005. For comparison, returns for the Lipper General Municipal
Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average (the "Lipper Average") are also included. The
funds that comprise the Lipper Average have generally similar investment
objectives to the Fund, although some may have different investment policies
and sales and management fees.

The Fund outperformed its benchmark and its peer group, as represented by the
Lipper Average, during both the six- and 12-month periods ended April 30, 2005.
The Fund's stronger relative performance versus its benchmark during the
six-month reporting period was largely the result of security selection in the
insured, special tax and hospital sectors. Security selection in the industrial
revenue bond sector detracted from performance. The Fund's relative exposure to
the pre-refunded, hospital, housing and industrial revenue bond sectors also
contributed positively to the Fund's performance.

Market Review and Investment Strategy
During the six-month period ended April 30, 2005, long-term municipal bond
yields declined and short-term municipal bond yields increased. Yields moved in
a similar manner in the Treasury bond market. The rise in short-term bond
yields was in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve increasing the target for
the Federal Funds rate by 1.00% through four rate hikes over the period.
Inconclusive economic signals and moderate inflation expectations, however,
allowed longer-term bond yields to decline. On a pre-tax basis, the municipal
market outperformed the taxable bond market for the six-month period ended
April 30, 2005. The LB Municipal Index gained 1.93%, versus the LB U.S.
Aggregate Index, representing taxable bonds, which returned 0.98% during the
same time frame. As of April 30, 2005, 30-year municipal bonds were yielding
approximately 97% of comparable maturity Treasury bonds.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 1


Interest rates are still low by historical standards versus inflation and
indications of economic growth. As such, the Fund's portfolio managers (the
"managers") continue to maintain shorter-than-benchmark portfolio durations.
The low-rate environment has led to relatively strong demand for lower-rated
bonds as investors seek higher income producing bonds. As the yield premium on
lower-rated bonds declined, making them more expensive to buy/own versus high
quality bonds, the managers sold lower-rated bonds opportunistically. Stronger
economic growth has helped boost state and local government tax revenues,
improving the creditworthiness of state and local issuers. Holdings in general
obligation bonds benefited from this trend.

HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE


An Important Note About the Value of Historical Performance
The performance on the following page represents past performance and does not
guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance information shown. Returns are annualized for periods longer than
one year. All fees and expenses related to the operation of the Fund have been
deducted. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not
account for taxes.

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund Shareholder Information
Daily market prices for the Fund's shares are published in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transaction section of The Wall Street Journal under the
abbreviation "AllianceNA." The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "AFB." Weekly
comparative net asset value (NAV) and market price information about the Fund
is published each Monday in The Wall Street Journal, each Sunday in The New
York Times and each Saturday in Barron's and other newspapers in a table called
"Closed-End Bond Funds." For additional shareholder information regarding this
Fund, please see page 39.

Benchmark Disclosure
The unmanaged Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index does not reflect fees and
expenses associated with the active management of a mutual fund portfolio. The
Index is a total return performance benchmark for the long-term, investment
grade, tax-exempt bond market. For both the six- and 12-month periods ended
April 30, 2005, the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average
consisted of 67 funds. These funds have generally similar investment objectives
to the Fund, although some may have different investment policies and sales and
management fees. An investor cannot invest directly in an index or average, and
their results are not indicative of the performance for any specific
investment, including the Fund.

A Word About Risk
Among the risks of investing in the Fund are changes in the general level of
interest rates or changes in bond credit quality ratings. Changes in interest
rates have a greater effect on bonds with longer maturities than on those with
shorter maturities. Please note, as interest rates rise, existing bond prices
fall and can cause the value of your investment in the Fund to decline.While
the Fund invests principally in bonds and other fixed-income securities, in
order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain
types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater
than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. At the discretion of
the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in
municipal bonds that are rated below investment grade ("junk bonds"). These
securities involve greater volatility and risk than higher-quality fixed-income
securities.

The issuance of the Fund's preferred stock results in leveraging of the Common
Stock, an investment technique usually considered speculative. Leverage creates
certain risks for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both
the net asset value and market value of the Common Stock, and fluctuations in
the dividend rates on the preferred stock will affect the return to holders of
Common Stock. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and if
short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends paid
on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income available
for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset value of the
Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may,
as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price of the
portfolio's investments, since the value of the Fund's Preferred Stock does not
fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 19


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2005 (unaudited)

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which requires management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation
Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities not listed on an exchange but traded on The
NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ
Official Closing Price; listed put or call options are valued at the last sale
price. If there has been no sale on that day, such securities will be valued at
the closing bid prices on that day; open futures contracts and options thereon
are valued using the closing settlement price or, in the absence of such a
price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are no quotations available
for the day of valuation, the last available closing settlement price is used;
securities traded in the over-the-counter market, ("OTC") (but excluding
securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid and
asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable
sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having 60 days
or less remaining until maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original
maturity was 60 days or less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st
day prior to maturity if their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days;
fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed and asset backed securities,
may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a
price obtained from one or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where
broker/dealer quotes are obtained, Alliance Capital Management, L.P. (the
"Adviser") may establish procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads
are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a
security;


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


and OTC and other derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or
spread from a major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because, most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes
It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions
Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the trade date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums
and accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions
Dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those
determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To
the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders. Such fee is accrued
daily and paid monthly. The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion
of its fees or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of 0.25% of the
Fund's average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders
for the first 5 full years of the Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's
average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders in
year 6, 0.15% in year


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 21


7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the six months ended April 30,
2005, the amount of such fees waived was $638,188.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance Global
Investor Services, Inc. (AGIS), an affiliate of the Adviser, the Fund
reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for the
Fund.During the six months ended April 30, 2005, there was no reimbursement
paid to AGIS.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions
Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the six months ended April 30, 2005, were as follows:

                                             Purchases             Sales

  U.S. government securities)              $ 53,216,599        $ 58,325,425
U.S. government securities                           -0-                 -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was substantially the
same as the cost for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, gross
unrealized appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap and futures
transactions) are as follows:

Gross unrealized appreciation                                   $28,344,512
Gross unrealized depreciation                                      (161,688)

                                                                -----------

1. Swap Agreements
The Portfolio may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received by the Portfolio, and/or the termination value at the end of the
contract. Therefore, the Portfolio considers the creditworthiness of each
counterparty to a swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk.
Additionally, risks may arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or
in the value of the underlying securities.

As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. The Fund accrues for the interim payments


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


on swap contracts on a daily basis, with the net amount recorded within
unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of
assets and liabilities. Once the interim payments are settled in cash, the net
amount is recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in addition to realized
gain/loss recorded upon the termination of swap contracts on the statement of
operations. Prior to November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected
within interest income/expense in the statement of operations. Fluctuations in
the value of swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in
unrealized appreciation/depreciation of investments.

2. Financial Futures Contracts
The Fund may buy or sell financial futures contracts for the purpose of hedging
the portfolio against adverse effects of anticipated movements in the market.
The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value of these
financial instruments and the imperfect correlation between movements in the
price of the futures contracts and movements in the price of the securities
hedged or used for cover.

At the time the Fund enters into a futures contract, the Fund deposits and
maintains as collateral an initial margin as required by the exchange on which
the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
fluctuation in the value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
Risks may arise from the potential inability of the counterparty to meet the
terms of the contract. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the
time it was opened and the time it was closed.

NOTE D
Common Stock
The Fund has 1,999,992,200 shares of $.001 par value common stock authorized.
There are 20,471,667 shares of common stock outstanding at April 30, 2005.

NOTE E
Preferred Stock
The Fund has authorized, issued and outstanding 7,800 shares of Auction
Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series T and W. The dividend rate on the Series M is 2.86% effective
through May 9, 2005. The dividend rate on the Series T is 2.76% effective
through May 3, 2005. The dividend rate on the Series W is 2.71% effective
through May 4,


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 23


2005. The dividend rate on the Series TH is 1.70% effective through August 4,
2005.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.

NOTE F
Distributions To Common Shareholders
The tax character of distributions to be paid to common shareholders for the
year ending October 31, 2005 will be determined at the end of the current
fiscal year. The tax character of distributions paid to common shareholders
during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004 and October 31, 2003 were as
follows:

                                                2004                2003
                                           ------------         -----------
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income                          $     75,220        $     56,946
  Tax exempt income                          20,243,067          17,845,503
                                           ------------         -----------
Total distributions paid                   $ 20,318,287        $ 17,902,449
                                           ------------         -----------

As of October 31, 2004, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                             $   5,057,817
Accumulated capital and other losses                           (3,839,649)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                         25,735,319(b)
                                                             --------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                         $ 26,953,487(c)
                                                             --------------

(a)  On October 31, 2004, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$3,839,649, of which $1,199,398 expires in the year 2010, $2,630,045 expires in
the year 2011, and $10,206 expires in the year 2012. To the extent future
capital gains are offset by capital loss carryforward, such gains will not be
distributed.


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


(b)  The differences between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are attributed primarily to the difference between
the book and tax treatment of swap income and the realization for tax purposes
of gain/losses on certain derivative instruments.

(c)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis components of accumulated
earnings/(deficit) is attributable primarily to dividends payable.

NOTE G
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund
Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE H
Legal Proceedings
As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as
"market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to
cooperate with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not
redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by
the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the
market timing and late trading practices that are the subject of the
investigations mentioned above or the lawsuits described below. Please see
below for a description of the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC
and NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 25


above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The lawsuits are now
pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland
pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
transferring and centralizing all of the mutual fund cases involving market and
late trading in the District of Maryland. Management of the Adviser believes
that these private lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on
the results of operations or financial condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuance dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAG Order"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

     (i)    The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the
"Reimbursement Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse
effects of market timing attributable to market timing relationships described
in the SEC Order. According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be
paid, in order of priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share
of losses suffered by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate
share of advisory fees paid by such fund during the period of such market
timing;

     (ii)   The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from
some of  the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing
January 1, 2004, for a period of at least five years; and

     (iii)  The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the
Adviser's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

The Adviser and approximately twelve other investment management firms were
publicly mentioned in connection with the settlement by the SEC of charges that
an unaffiliated broker/dealer violated federal securities laws relating to its
receipt of compensation for selling specific mutual funds and the disclosure of
such com-


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pensation. The SEC indicated publicly that, among other things, it was
considering enforcement action in connection with mutual funds' disclosure of
such arrangements and in connection with the practice of considering mutual
fund sales in the direction of brokerage commissions from fund portfolio
transactions. The SEC issued subpoenas to the Adviser, and the NASD issued
requests for information in connection with this matter and the Adviser
provided documents and other information to the SEC and NASD and cooperated
fully with the investigations. On June 8, 2005 the NASD announced that it had
reached a settlement with AllianceBernstein Investment Research and Management,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Adviser and the distributor of the
open-end mutual funds sponsored by the Adviser, in connection with this matter.
Management of the Adviser expects that the settlement has resolved both
regulatory inquires described above.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal
defendants. The Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York by an alleged shareholder of an
AllianceBernstein mutual fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other
things, (i) that certain of the defendants improperly authorized the payment of
excessive commissions and other fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in
exchange for preferential marketing services, (ii) that certain of the
defendants misrepresented and omitted from registration statements and other
reports material facts concerning such payments, and (iii) that certain
defendants caused such conduct as control persons of other defendants. The
Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and
48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206 and 215 of the Advisers Act,
breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding and abetting breaches of
common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of
compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of their contracts with
the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the Adviser pursuant to
such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees, commissions and soft
dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or discriminatorily obtained
fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, numerous additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants, and others may be filed.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.

(a)  As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however, prior to
November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. For the year ended October 31,
2004, the effect of this change to the net investment income and the net
realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment transactions was less than
$0.01 per share and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets
was .00%.

(b)  Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing
of the first public offering was $14.30.

(c)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)  Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(e)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(f)  These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect
of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(g)  Annualized.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 31


Information Regarding the Review and Approval of the Fund's Advisory Agreement
The Fund's disinterested directors (the "directors") unanimously approved the
continuance of the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser at a
meeting held on February 7-10, 2005

In preparation for the meeting, the directors had requested from the Adviser
and evaluated extensive materials, including performance and expense
information for other investment companies with similar investment objectives
derived from data compiled by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"). Prior to voting, the
directors reviewed the proposed continuance of the Advisory Agreement with
management and with experienced counsel who are independent of the Adviser and
received a memorandum from such counsel discussing the legal standards for
their consideration of the proposed continuance. The directors also discussed
the proposed continuance in two private sessions at which only the directors,
their independent counsel and the Fund's Independent Compliance Officer were
present. In reaching their determinations relating to continuance of the
Advisory Agreement, the directors considered all factors they believed
relevant, including the following:

   1.   information comparing the performance of the Fund to other investment
companies with similar investment objectives and to an index;

   2.   the nature, extent and quality of investment, compliance,
administrative and other services rendered by the Adviser;

   3.   payments received by the Adviser from all sources in respect of the
Fund and all investment companies in the AllianceBernstein Fund complex;

   4.   the costs borne by, and profitability of, the Adviser and its
affiliates in providing services to the Fund and to all investment companies in
the AllianceBernstein Fund complex;

   5.   comparative fee and expense data for the Fund and other investment
companies with similar investment objectives;

   6.   the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund
grows and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit
of investors;

   7.   the Adviser's policies and practices regarding allocation of portfolio
transactions of the Fund, including the extent to which the Adviser benefits
from soft dollar arrangements;


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


   8.   portfolio turnover rates for the Fund;

   9.   fall-out benefits which the Adviser and its affiliates receive from
their relationships with the Fund;

   10.  the Adviser's representation that it does not advise other clients with
similar investment objectives and strategies;

   11.  the professional experience and qualifications of the Fund's portfolio
management team and other senior personnel of the Adviser; and

   12.  the terms of the Advisory Agreement.

The directors also considered their knowledge of the nature and quality of the
services provided by the Adviser to the Fund gained from their experience as
directors or trustees of most of the funds advised by the Adviser, their
overall confidence in the Adviser's integrity and competence they have gained
from that experience and the Adviser's responsiveness to concerns raised by
them in the past, including the Adviser's willingness to consider and implement
organizational and operational changes designed to improve investment results
and the services provided to the AllianceBernstein Funds.

In their deliberations, the directors did not identify any particular
information that was all-important or controlling, and each director attributed
different weights to the various factors.

The directors determined that the overall arrangements between the Fund and the
Adviser, as provided in the Advisory Agreement, were fair and reasonable in
light of the services performed, expenses incurred and such other matters as
the directors considered relevant in the exercise of their business judgment.

The material factors and conclusions that formed the basis for the directors'
reaching their determinations to approve the continuance of the Advisory
Agreement (including their determinations that the Adviser should continue to
be the investment adviser for the Fund, and that the fees payable to the
Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement are appropriate) were separately
discussed by the directors.

Nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser
The directors noted that, under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to
the control of the directors, administers the Fund's business and other
affairs. The Adviser manages the investment of the assets of the Fund,
including making purchases and sales of portfolio securities consistent with
the Fund's investment objective and policies. The Adviser also provides the
Fund with such office space, administrative and other services (exclusive of,
and in addition to, any such ser-


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 33


vices provided by any others retained by the Fund) and executive and other
personnel as are necessary for the Fund's operations. The Adviser pays all of
the compensation of directors of the Fund who are affiliated persons of the
Adviser and of the officers of the Fund.

The directors also considered that a provision in the Advisory Agreement for
the Fund provides that the Fund will reimburse the Adviser for the cost of
certain clerical, accounting, administrative and other services provided at the
Fund's request by employees of the Adviser or its affiliates. The directors
noted that no reimbursements had been made to date by the Fund to the Adviser
as no requests for such reimbursements had been made in light of the expense
cap for the Fund. Requests for these "at no more than cost" reimbursements are
approved by the directors on a quarterly basis for most of the open-end
AllianceBernstein funds and result in a higher rate of total compensation from
the funds to the Adviser than the stated fee rates in the funds' advisory
agreements.

The directors considered the scope and quality of services provided by the
Adviser under the Advisory Agreement and noted that the scope of services
provided had expanded over time as a result of regulatory and other
developments. The directors noted that, for example, the Adviser is responsible
for maintaining and monitoring its own and, to varying degrees, the Fund's
compliance programs, and these compliance programs have recently been refined
and enhanced in light of new regulatory requirements. The directors considered
the quality of the investment research capabilities of the Adviser and the
other resources it has dedicated to performing services for the Fund. The
quality of administrative and other services, including the Adviser's role in
coordinating the activities of the Fund's other service providers, also were
considered. The directors also considered the Adviser's response to recent
regulatory compliance issues affecting many of the investment companies in the
AllianceBernstein Fund complex. The directors concluded that, overall, they
were satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of services provided to the
Fund under the Advisory Agreement.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability to the Adviser
The directors reviewed a schedule of the revenues, expenses and related notes
indicating the profitability of the Fund to the Adviser for calendar year 2003
and for the period from January 28, 2002 (inception) to December 31, 2002. The
directors reviewed the assumptions and methods of allocation used by the
Adviser in preparing fund-specific profitability data, and noted the Adviser's
representation to them that it believed that the methods of allocation used in
preparing the profitability information were reasonable and appropriate and
that the Adviser had previously discussed with the directors that there is no
generally accepted allocation methodology for information of this type.

The directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of
profitability


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


from fund advisory contracts because comparative information is not generally
publicly available and is affected by numerous factors, including the structure
of the particular adviser, the types of funds it manages, its business mix,
numerous assumptions regarding allocations and the adviser's capital structure
and cost of capital. In considering profitability information, the directors
considered the effect of fall-out benefits on the Adviser's expenses. The
directors focused on the profitability of the Adviser's relationship with the
Fund before taxes. The directors recognized that the Adviser should generally
be entitled to earn a reasonable level of profits for the services it provides
to the Fund and, based on their review, concluded that they were satisfied that
the Adviser's level of profitability from its relationship with the Fund was
not excessive.

Fall-Out Benefits
The directors considered that the Adviser benefits from soft dollar
arrangements whereby it receives brokerage and research services from many of
the brokers and dealers that execute purchases and sales of securities on
behalf of its clients, including the Fund. While the Fund does not normally
engage in brokerage transactions, the Adviser may benefit from soft dollar
arrangements when the Fund purchases securities in fixed price underwritings.
They noted that the Adviser makes presentations to the directors regarding its
trading practices and brokerage allocation policies, including its policies
with respect to soft dollar arrangements, from time to time and had made a
special presentation to the directors in 2004 on this subject. The directors
noted that the Adviser has represented to them that all of its soft dollar
arrangements are consistent with applicable legal requirements including the
achievement of best execution. At the special presentation, the directors
received and reviewed information concerning the Adviser's soft dollar
arrangements, which included a description of the Adviser's policies and
procedures with respect to allocating portfolio transactions for brokerage and
research services, data on the dollar amount of commissions allocated for
third-party research and brokerage services and for proprietary research and
brokerage services, and a list of firms providing third-party research and
brokerage to the Adviser.

The directors also noted that a subsidiary of the Adviser provides certain
shareholder services to the Fund and receives compensation from the Fund for
such services.

The directors recognized that the Adviser's profitability would be somewhat
lower if it did not receive research for soft dollars or if the Adviser's
subsidiary did not receive the other benefits described above. The directors
believe that the Adviser derives reputational and other benefits from its
association with the Fund.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 35


Investment Results
In addition to the information reviewed by the directors in connection with the
meeting, the directors receive detailed comparative performance information for
the Fund at each regular Board meeting during the year. At the meeting, the
directors reviewed information showing performance of the Fund compared to
other funds in the Lipper General Municipal Debt Average (Leveraged) for
periods ending December 31, 2004 and compared to the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index. The directors noted that the Fund had performed slightly above the
Lipper median in the 1-year period and significantly above the Lipper medians
in the 1-month, 3-month and since-inception periods (January 2002 inception).
Based on their review, the directors concluded that the Fund's relative
investment performance over time had been satisfactory.

Advisory Fees and Other Expenses
The directors considered the advisory fee rate paid by the Fund to the Adviser
and information prepared by Lipper concerning fee rates paid by other funds in
the same Lipper category as the Fund. The directors recognized that it is
difficult to make comparisons of advisory fees because there are variations in
the services that are included in the fees paid by other funds.

The directors noted that in connection with the settlement of the market timing
matter with the New York Attorney General, the Adviser agreed to material
reductions (averaging 20%) in the fee schedules of most of the open-end funds
sponsored by the Adviser (other than money market funds). As a result of that
settlement, the Adviser's fees (i) for managing open-end high income funds are
..50% of the first $2.5 billion of average daily net assets, .45% for average
daily net assets over that level to $5 billion, and .40% for average daily net
assets over $5 billion; and (ii) for managing open-end low risk income funds
are .45% of the first $2.5 billion of average daily net assets, .40% for
average daily net assets over that level to $5 billion, and .35% for average
daily net assets over $5 billion.

At their December 14-16, 2004 meetings, the directors requested a reduction in
the advisory fees of the Fund to the fee levels charged to comparable open-end
funds managed by the Adviser and deferred renewal of the Fund's Advisory
Agreement pending receipt and consideration of proposals by the Adviser. At the
February 7-10, 2005 meeting, the directors considered the Adviser's position
that no fee adjustments were warranted.

The directors also considered the total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison
to the fees and expenses of funds within the relevant Lipper category. The
expense ratio of the Fund was based on the Fund's latest fiscal year expense
ratio. The expense ratio of the Fund reflected fee waivers and/or expense
reimbursements. The directors recognized that the expense ratio information for
the Fund


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


potentially reflected on the Adviser's provision of services, as the Adviser is
responsible for coordinating services provided to the Fund by others. The
directors noted that the expense ratios of some funds in the Fund's Lipper
category also were lowered by waivers or reimbursements by those funds'
investment advisers, which in some cases were voluntary and perhaps temporary.

The information reviewed by the directors showed that the Fund's at current
size contractual effective fee rate of 65 basis points was slightly above the
Lipper average and the Lipper median. The directors also noted that the Fund's
expense ratio was slightly below the Lipper median. The directors concluded
that the Fund's expense ratio was satisfactory.

Economies of Scale
The directors considered that the Fund is a closed-end Fund and that it was not
expected to have meaningful asset growth as a result. In such circumstances,
the directors did not view the potential for realization of economies of scale
as the Fund's assets grow to be a material factor in their deliberations. The
directors also noted that if the Fund's net assets were to increase materially
as a result of, e.g., an acquisition or rights offering, they would review
whether potential economies of scale would be realized.

     Income Fund, Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net

     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
     information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
     subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
     particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting to provide
     reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
     the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
     with generally accepted accounting principles;

c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
     procedures presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
     of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date within 90 days
     prior to the filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control
     over financial reporting that occurred during the second fiscal quarter of
     the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is
     reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control
     over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
     operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
     likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
     summarize, and report financial information; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control

     over financial reporting.
