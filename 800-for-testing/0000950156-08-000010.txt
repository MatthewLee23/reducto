LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders:

The past year has been a great example of why investors should keep their eyes
on the long term.

In 2006 the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 19% and was fairly stable.
This year we have seen a greater level of volatility than has been experienced
in recent years. The Dow hit several new highs but also experienced swift drops
as a global credit crisis swept through markets, spurred by defaults on U.S.
subprime loans and a liquidity crunch. Still, even with this volatility, the
Dow ended the first three quarters of 2007 with a return near 13%.

U.S. Treasury bonds gained ground, especially in the third quarter as investors
sought less risky asset classes. The spreads of many lower quality debt
investments widened.

In 2007 the U.S. dollar fell against the euro, oil prices have hit their
highest levels yet, and gold has spiked to its steepest price in 28 years.
Around the globe, stocks sold off as risk aversion mounted. As we have said
before, markets can be volatile, and investors should make sure they have an
investment plan that can carry them through the peaks and troughs.

If you are focused on a long-term investment strategy, the short-term ups and
downs of the markets should not necessarily dictate portfolio action on your
part. In our view, investors who remain committed to a long-term plan are more
likely to achieve their financial goals.

In any market environment, we believe individual investors are best served by
following a three-pronged investment strategy of allocating their holdings
across the major asset classes, diversifying within each class, and regularly
rebalancing their portfolios to maintain their desired allocations. Of course,
these strategies cannot guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. Investing
and planning for the long term require diligence and patience, two traits that
in our experience are essential to capitalizing on the many opportunities the
financial markets can offer -- through both up and down economic cycles.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

    December 14, 2007

              -------------------------------------------------

(a) The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
    weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
    agencies.
(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price is likely to fluctuate
    with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond
    with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(i) For purposes of this presentation, the bond component includes both accrued
    interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any derivative holdings,
    if applicable.
(m) The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
    the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which
    have been pre-refunded or pre-paid to an earlier date or which have a
    mandatory put date prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown
    takes into account these earlier dates.
(o) Less than 0.1%.
(r) Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
    rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
    Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based
    on the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a
    security which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is
    considered Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency
    mortgage-backed securities, if any, are included in the "AAA"-rating
    category. Percentages are based on the total market value of investments as
    of 10/31/07.

From time to time "Cash & Other Net Assets" may be negative due to timing of
cash receipts and/or equivalent exposure from any derivative holdings.

Percentages are based on net assets, including preferred shares, as of 10/31/07,
unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed and current holdings may be different.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the fund) is a closed-end fund and maintains a
portfolio that includes investments in debt securities issued by or on behalf
of states, territories and possessions of the United States and the District of
Columbia, the interest on which is exempt from federal income tax.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2007, shares of the MFS Municipal
Income Trust provided a total return of 1.17%, at net asset value. This
compares with a return of 2.91% for the fund's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The U.S. economy continues to decouple from the rest of the world. Despite
seemingly robust growth rates during the second and third quarters of 2007,
underlying economic activity in the U.S. remains muted relative to other major
economies. Overall, global economies have seen moderate to strong growth over
the last twelve months as domestic demand improves and world trade accelerates.

With the strong global growth, however, has come increased concern about rising
global inflation, especially as capacity becomes more constrained, wages rise,
and energy and food prices advance. During the reporting period, global central
banks tightened monetary conditions, which in turn pushed global bond yields to
their highest levels during this economic expansion.

However, beginning in late July, heightened uncertainty and distress concerning
the subprime mortgage market caused several global credit markets to seize up,
forcing central banks to inject liquidity and to reassess their tightening
biases as sovereign bond yields declined and credit spreads widened. While
credit conditions improved somewhat by late October as the Federal Reserve
Board cut interest rates, the level of market turbulence remains significant.
Increased market volatility has also been exacerbated by U.S. home
foreclosures, falling housing prices, and a weakening trend in the labor
market. Despite increased volatility across all asset classes and the widening
in credit spreads, global equity markets remained elevated, generally having
erased losses incurred earlier in the summer.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

The fund's allocation to bonds rated "BBB"(s) and below hurt performance over
the reporting period as credit spreads widened. The fund's positioning in the
health care sector also detracted from relative performance.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

The fund's shorter duration(d) stance benefited relative performance as
interest rates generally declined on the shorter end of the yield curve(y).
Security selection was another factor that enhanced relative results.

Respectfully,

Gary Lasman                            Geoffrey Schechter
Portfolio Manager                      Portfolio Manager

(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price is likely to fluctuate
    with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond
    with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(s) Bonds rated "BBB", "Baa", or higher are considered investment grade; bonds
    rated "BB", "Ba", or below are considered non-investment grade. The primary
    source for bond quality ratings is Moody's Investors Service. If not
    available, ratings by Standard & Poor's are used, else ratings by Fitch,
    Inc. For securities which are not rated by any of the three agencies, the
    security is considered Not Rated.
(y) A yield curve graphically depicts the yields of different maturity bonds of
    the same credit quality and type; a normal yield curve is upward sloping,
    with short-term rates lower than long-term rates.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index - a market-value-weighted index
representative of the tax-exempt bond market.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The fund's shares may trade at a discount or premium to net asset value.
Shareholders do not have the right to cause the fund to repurchase their shares
at net asset value. When fund shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than
the net asset value underlying fund shares, and shares purchased at a premium
would receive less than the amount paid for them in the event of the fund's
liquidation. As a result, the total return that is calculated based on the net
asset value and New York Stock Exchange price can be different.

From time to time the fund may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
fund hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of the
fund in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on such
terms as the Trustees shall determine.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE FUND

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

The fund's objective is to seek high current income exempt from federal income
tax, but may also consider capital appreciation. The fund's objective may be
changed without shareholder approval.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

The fund invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net
assets in municipal bonds (debt securities issued by or on behalf of states,
territories, possessions of the United States, District of Columbia and their
political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, the interest on which is
exempt from federal income tax). This policy may not be changed without
shareholder approval. Interest from the fund's investments may be subject to
the federal alternative minimum tax.

MFS may invest 25% or more of the fund's total assets in municipal instruments
that finance similar projects, such as those relating to education, healthcare,
housing, utilities, water, or sewers.

MFS may invest up to 100% of the fund's assets in lower quality debt
instruments, including those that are in default.

MFS may use derivatives for different purposes, including to earn income and
enhance returns, to increase or decrease exposure to a particular market, to
manage or adjust the risk profile of the fund, or as alternatives to direct
investments.

MFS uses a bottom-up investment approach in buying and selling investments for
the fund. Investments are selected primarily based on fundamental analysis of
instruments and their issuers in light of current market, economic, political,
and regulatory conditions. Factors considered may include the instrument's
credit quality, collateral characteristics, and indenture provisions, and the
issuer's management ability, capital structure, leverage, and ability to meet
its current obligations. Quantitative analysis of the structure of the
instrument and its features may also be considered.

The fund uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares and investing
the proceeds pursuant to its investment strategies.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

The portfolio's yield and share prices change daily based on the credit quality
of its investments and changes in interest rates. In general, the value of debt
securities will decline when interest rates rise and will increase when
interest rates fall. Debt securities with longer maturity dates will generally
be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter maturities.
Municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected by adverse tax
or court rulings, legislative or political changes and the financial condition
of the issuers and/or insurers of municipal instruments. If the Internal
Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal security has not complied
with applicable tax requirements, interest from the security could become
taxable and the security could decline significantly in value. Derivatives can
be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to those of the underlying
indicator's in whose value the derivative is based. Gains or losses from
derivatives can be substantially greater than the derivatives' original cost.
Lower quality debt securities involve substantially greater risk of default and
their value can decline significantly over time. To the extent that investments
are purchased with the issuance of preferred shares, the fund's net asset value
will increase or decrease at a greater rate than a comparable unleveraged fund.
When you sell your shares, they may be worth more or less than the amount you
paid for them. Please see the prospectus for further information regarding
these and other risk considerations. A copy of the fund's prospectus is
available on the EDGAR database on the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Internet Web site at http://sec.gov.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND
CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you
to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the fund or only the long-
term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that price
exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the
shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price
of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.
Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in any amount
over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate. There is no service
charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage charges for shares
issued directly by the fund. However, when shares are bought on the New York
Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each participant pays a pro
rata share of the transaction expenses, including commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time. Please have
available the name of the fund and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details. When you
withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in
one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a
certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional shares.

Effective May 1, 2007, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the Transfer Agent
for the fund) became the agent for the plan.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the fund) is organized as a Massachusetts business
trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
as a closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The fund
can invest up to 100% of its portfolio in high-yield securities rated below
investment grade. Investments in high-yield securities involve greater degrees
of credit and market risk than investments in higher-rated securities and tend
to be more sensitive to economic conditions. Municipal securities backed by
current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can
be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the
projects or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from
the assets. If the Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal
security has not complied with applicable tax requirements, the security could
decline in value, interest from the security could become taxable and the fund
may be required to issue Forms 1099-DIV.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated or
composite bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Short-term
instruments with a maturity at issuance of 60 days or less may be valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value. Swaps are generally valued at
an evaluated bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Securities and
other assets generally valued on the basis of information from an independent
pricing service may also be valued at a broker-dealer bid quotation. Values
obtained from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and
electronic data processing techniques, which take into account factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics, and other market
data. The Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility for
determining or causing to be determined the value of the fund's investments
(including any fair valuation) to the adviser pursuant to valuation policies
and procedures approved by the Board. If the adviser determines that reliable
market quotations are not readily available, investments are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with such
procedures under the oversight of the Board of Trustees. Under the fund's
valuation policies and procedures, market quotations are not considered to be
readily available for many types of debt instruments and certain types of
derivatives. These investments are generally valued at fair value based on
information from independent pricing services. In addition, investments may be
valued at fair value if the adviser determines that an investment's value has
been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or
market on which the investment is principally traded (such as foreign exchange
or market) and prior to the determination of the fund's net asset value, or
after the halting of trading of a specific security where trading does not
resume prior to the close of the exchange or market on which the security is
principally traded. The adviser may rely on independent pricing services or
other information (such as the correlation with price movements of similar
securities in the same or other markets; the type, cost and investment
characteristics of the security; the business and financial condition of the
issuer; and trading and other market data) to assist in determining whether to
fair value and at what value to fair value an investment. The value of an
investment for purposes of calculating the fund's net asset value can differ
depending on the source and method used to determine value. When fair valuation
is used, the value of investments used to determine the fund's net asset value
may differ from quoted or published prices for the same investments.

In September 2006, FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (the
"Statement") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 and for all interim periods within those fiscal years. This
Statement provides a single definition of fair value, a hierarchy for measuring
fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. Management
is evaluating the application of the Statement to the fund, and believes the
impact will be limited to expanded disclosures resulting from the adoption of
this Statement in the fund's financial statements.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The fund may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-hedging
purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or
eliminate gains. When the fund uses derivatives as an investment to gain market
exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from derivative instruments
may be substantially greater than the derivative's original cost. Derivative
instruments include swap agreements and inverse floaters.

SWAP AGREEMENTS - The fund may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the fund and another party. Net cash payments
are exchanged at specified intervals and are recorded as a realized gain or
loss in the Statement of Operations. The value of the swap is adjusted daily
and the change in value, including accruals of periodic amounts of interest to
be paid or received, is recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in
the Statement of Operations. A liquidation payment received or made upon early
termination is recorded as a realized gain or loss in the Statement of
Operations. Collateral, in the form of cash or securities, may be required to
be held in segregated accounts with the fund's custodian in connection with
these agreements. Risk of loss may exceed amounts recognized on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. These risks include the possible lack of a liquid
market, failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
agreements, and unfavorable market movement of the underlying instrument. All
swap agreements entered into by the fund with the same counterparty are
generally governed by a single master agreement, which provides for the netting
of all amounts owed by the parties under the agreement upon the occurrence of
an event of default, thereby reducing the credit risk to which such party is
exposed.

The fund holds interest rate swap agreements which involve the periodic
exchange of cash flows, such as the exchange of fixed rate interest payments
for floating rate interest payments based on a notional principal amount. The
interest rates may be based on a specific financial index or the exchange of
two distinct floating rate payments. The fund may enter into an interest rate
swap in order to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

INVERSE FLOATERS - The fund invests in municipal inverse floating rate
securities which are structured by the issuer (known as primary market inverse
floating rate securities) or by an investment banker utilizing municipal bonds
which have already been issued (known as secondary market inverse floating rate
securities) to have variable rates of interest which typically move in the
opposite direction of short term interest rates. A secondary market inverse
floating rate security is created when an investment banker transfers a fixed
rate municipal bond to a special purpose trust (the "trust"), and causes the
trust to (a) issue floating rate certificates to third parties, in an amount
equal to a fraction of the par amount of the deposited bonds (these
certificates usually pay tax-exempt interest at short-term interest rates that
typically reset weekly; and the certificate holders typically, on seven days
notice, have the option to tender their certificates to the investment banker
or another party for redemption at par plus accrued interest), and (b) issue
inverse floating rate certificates (sometimes referred to as "inverse
floaters"). If the holder of the inverse floater transfers the municipal bonds
to an investment banker for the purpose of depositing the municipal bonds into
the special purpose trust, the inverse floating rate certificates that are
issued by the trust are referred to as "self-deposited inverse floaters." If
the bonds held by the trust are purchased by the investment banker for deposit
into the trust from someone other than the purchasers of the inverse floaters,
the inverse floating rate certificates that are issued by the trust are
referred to as "externally deposited inverse floaters." Such self-deposited
inverse floaters held by the fund are accounted for as secured borrowings, with
the municipal bonds reflected in the investments of the fund and amounts owed
to the holder of the floating rate certificate under the provisions of the
trust, which amounts are paid solely from the assets of the trust, reflected as
liabilities of the fund in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities under the
caption, "Payable to the holder of the floating rate certificate from trust
assets". At October 31, 2007, the fund's payable to the holder of the floating
rate certificate from trust assets was $5,367,581. The weighted average
interest rate on the floating rate certificates issued by the trust was 4.12%.
Interest expense and fees relate to payments made to the holder of the floating
rate certificate from trust assets in connection with self-deposited inverse
floater transactions. Interest expense and fees are recorded as incurred. For
the year ended October 31, 2007, interest expense and fees in connection with
self-deposited inverse floaters was $238,877. Primary and externally deposited
inverse floaters held by the fund are not accounted for as secured borrowings.

INDEMNIFICATIONS - Under the fund's organizational documents, its officers and
trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to the fund. Additionally, in the normal
course of business, the fund enters into agreements with service providers that
may contain indemnification clauses. The fund's maximum exposure under these
agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the fund that have not yet occurred.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All premium and
original issue discount is amortized or accreted for tax reporting purposes as
required by federal income tax regulations. The fund may receive proceeds from
litigation settlements. Any proceeds received from litigation involving
portfolio holdings are reflected in the Statement of Operations in realized
gain/loss if the security has been disposed of by the fund or in unrealized
gain/loss if the security is still held by the fund. Any other proceeds from
litigation not related to portfolio holdings are reflected as other income in
the Statement of Operations. Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to
preserve and protect the value of a security owned are added to the cost of the
security; other legal fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the
security issuer, which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or
enhance the value of high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to
the cost basis of the security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms
or conditions of capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of
reorganization are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to
protect or enhance an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or
legal actions, are expensed.

As a result of the change in estimate for the amortization of premium and
accretion of discount on certain debt securities, interest income has been
increased by $1,543,389, with a corresponding reduction to net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation).

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The fund's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
fund. This amount, for the year ended October 31, 2007, is shown as a reduction
of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The fund intends to qualify as a regulated
investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code,
and to distribute all of its taxable and tax-exempt income, including realized
capital gains. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is required in
the financial statements.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are
periodically adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax
character. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value
per share. Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain items of
income, expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and
tax purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess
of net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions
for financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and tax
purposes.

Book/tax differences primarily relate to amortization and accretion of debt
securities and secured borrowings.

The tax character of distributions declared to shareholders is as follows:

                                               10/31/07       10/31/06

          Ordinary income (including any
          short-term capital gains)            $113,468       $181,879

In June 2006, FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes (the "Interpretation") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as
of the effective date. On December 22, 2006, the SEC delayed the implementation
of the Interpretation for regulated investment companies for an additional six
months. This Interpretation prescribes a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return, and requires certain expanded disclosures. Management
has evaluated the application of the Interpretation to the fund, and has
determined that there is no impact resulting from the adoption of this
Interpretation on the fund's financial statements.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The fund has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
management and related administrative services and facilities to the fund. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the fund's average weekly net assets (including the value of the auction
preferred shares) and 6.32% of gross income. Gross income is calculated based
on tax rules that generally include the amortization of premium and exclude the
accretion of market discount, which may differ from investment income reported
in the Statement of Operations. The management fee, from net assets and gross
income, incurred for the year ended October 31, 2007 was equivalent to an
annual effective rate of 0.77% of the fund's average daily net assets including
preferred shares.

TRANSFER AGENT - Prior to December 18, 2006, MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS, received a fee from the fund for its services
as registrar and dividend-disbursing agent. Pursuant to a written agreement,
the fund paid MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a
dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. Effective December 18, 2006,
the fund has engaged Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") as the
sole transfer agent for the fund. MFSC will continue to monitor and supervise
the activities of Computershare for an agreed upon fee approved by the Board of
Trustees. For the year ended October 31, 2007, these fees paid to MFSC amounted
to $30,863. MFSC also receives payment from the fund for out-of-pocket
expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the fund. For the year ended October 31,
2007, these costs amounted to $4,745.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to the fund.
Under an administrative services agreement, the fund partially reimburses MFS
the costs incurred to provide these services. The fund is charged a fixed
amount plus a fee based on average daily net assets. The fund's annual fixed
amount is $17,500. The administrative services fee incurred for the year ended
October 31, 2007 was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.0190% of the
fund's average daily net assets including preferred shares.

TRUSTEES' AND OFFICERS' COMPENSATION - The fund pays compensation to
independent trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional
compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The fund does not pay
compensation directly to trustees or to officers of the fund who are also
officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the fund from MFS. Certain officers and trustees of the fund are
officers or directors of MFS and MFSC. The fund has an unfunded, defined
benefit plan for certain retired independent trustees which resulted in a
pension expense of $7,083. This amount is included in independent trustees'
compensation for the year ended October 31, 2007. The liability for deferred
retirement benefits payable to certain retired independent trustees amounted to
$104,371 at October 31, 2007, and is included in payable for independent
trustees' compensation.

OTHER - This fund and certain other MFS funds (the funds) have entered into a
services agreement (the Agreement) which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement. For the year ended October 31, 2007, the fee paid to Tarantino LLC
was $2,021. MFS has agreed to reimburse the fund for a portion of the payments
made by the funds to Tarantino LLC in the amount of $1,567, which is shown as a
reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations. Additionally, MFS
has agreed to bear all expenses associated with office space, other
administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO.

(4) PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. government securities,
purchased option transactions, and short-term obligations, aggregated
$109,387,169 and $108,440,677, respectively.

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The fund's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the fund of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest. During the year ended October 31, 2007, the fund did
not repurchase any shares. Transactions in fund shares were as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The fund and other funds managed by MFS participate in a $1 billion unsecured
committed line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a credit
agreement. In addition, the fund and other funds managed by MFS have
established uncommitted borrowing arrangements with certain banks. Borrowings
may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to each fund,
based on its borrowings, generally at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds
rate plus 0.30%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average daily,
unused portion of the committed line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. For the year ended
October 31, 2007, the fund's commitment fee and interest expense on the line of
credit were $1,625 and $921, respectively, and are included in miscellaneous
expense and interest expense and fees, respectively, on the Statement of
Operations.

(7) AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The fund issued 2,800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"), series T and
2,800 of APS, series TH. Dividends are cumulative at a rate that is reset every
seven days for both series through an auction process. During the year ended
October 31, 2007, the dividend rates ranged from 2.89% to 4.35%. The fund pays
an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred share liquidation value for
remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auction. The APS are
redeemable at the option of the fund in whole or in part at the redemption
price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The
APS are also subject to mandatory redemption if certain requirements relating
to their asset maintenance coverage are not satisfied. The fund is required to
maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
fund's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Municipal Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of MFS Municipal Income Trust (the "Fund") as of
October 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2007, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received
from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS Municipal
Income Trust as of October 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

until next elected or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement or removal.

Messrs. Butler, Gutow, Sherratt and Uek and Ms. Thomsen are members of the Trust's Audit Committee.

a subsidiary is the investment adviser or distributor, and, in the case of the officers, with certain
affiliates of MFS. As of January 1, 2007, the Trustees served as board members of 97 funds within the MFS
Family of Funds.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT
ADVISORY AGREEMENT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that both the full Board of
Trustees and a majority of the non-interested ("independent") Trustees, voting
separately, annually approve the continuation of the Fund's investment advisory
agreement with MFS. The Trustees consider matters bearing on the Fund and its
advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year, including a review
of performance data at each regular meeting. In addition, the independent
Trustees met several times over the course of three months beginning in May and
ending in July, 2007 ("contract review meetings") for the specific purpose of
considering whether to approve the continuation of the investment advisory
agreement for the Fund and the other investment companies that the Board
oversees (the "MFS Funds"). The independent Trustees were assisted in their
evaluation of the Fund's investment advisory agreement by independent legal
counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met
separately from MFS during various contract review meetings. The independent
Trustees were also assisted in this process by the MFS Funds' Independent Chief
Compliance Officer, a full-time senior officer appointed by and reporting to
the independent Trustees.

In connection with their deliberations regarding the continuation of the
investment advisory agreement, the Trustees, including the independent
Trustees, considered such information and factors as they believed, in light of
the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be
relevant. The investment advisory agreement for the Fund was considered
separately, although the Trustees also took into account the common interests
of all MFS Funds in their review. As described below, the Trustees considered
the nature, quality, and extent of the various investment advisory,
administrative, and shareholder services performed by MFS under the existing
investment advisory agreement and other arrangements with the Fund.

In connection with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and
relied upon materials that included, among other items: (i) information
provided by Lipper Inc. on the investment performance (based on net asset
value) of the Fund for various time periods ended December 31, 2006 and the
investment performance (based on net asset value) of a group of funds with
substantially similar investment classifications/objectives (the "Lipper
performance universe"), as well as the investment performance (based on net
asset value) of a group of funds identified by objective criteria suggested by
MFS ("MFS peer funds"), (ii) information provided by Lipper Inc. on the Fund's
advisory fees and other expenses and the advisory fees and other expenses of
comparable funds identified by Lipper (the "Lipper expense group"), as well as
the advisory fees and other expenses of MFS peer funds, (iii) information
provided by MFS on the advisory fees of comparable portfolios of other clients
of MFS, including institutional separate accounts and other clients, (iv)
information as to whether and to what extent applicable expense waivers,
reimbursements or fee "breakpoints" are observed for the Fund, (v) information
regarding MFS' financial results and financial condition, including MFS' and
certain of its affiliates' estimated profitability from services performed for
the Fund and the MFS Funds as a whole, (vi) MFS' views regarding the outlook
for the mutual fund industry and the strategic business plans of MFS, (vii)
descriptions of various functions performed by MFS for the Funds, such as
compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices, and (viii) information
regarding the overall organization of MFS, including information about MFS'
senior management and other personnel providing investment advisory,
administrative and other services to the Fund and the other MFS Funds. The
comparative performance, fee and expense information prepared and provided by
Lipper Inc. was not independently verified and the independent Trustees did not
independently verify any information provided to them by MFS.

The Trustees' conclusion as to the continuation of the investment advisory
agreement was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information
provided to the Trustees and not the result of any single factor. Some of the
factors that figured particularly in the Trustees' deliberations are described
below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information
presented differently from one another, giving different weights to various
factors. It is also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for the
Fund and other MFS Funds are the result of years of review and discussion
between the independent Trustees and MFS, that certain aspects of such
arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others, and
that the Trustees' conclusions may be based, in part, on their consideration of
these same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years.

Based on information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS, the Trustees reviewed the
Fund's total return investment performance as well as the performance of peer
groups of funds over various time periods. The Trustees placed particular
emphasis on the total return performance of the Fund's common shares in
comparison to the performance of funds in its Lipper performance universe over
the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, which the Trustees believed was
a long enough period to reflect differing market conditions. The total return
performance of the Fund's common shares ranked 4th out of a total of 9 funds in
the Lipper performance universe for this three-year period (a ranking of first
place out of the total number of funds in the performance universe indicating
the best performer and a ranking of last place out of the total number of funds
in the performance universe indicating the worst performer). The total return
performance of the Fund's common shares ranked 6th out of a total of 9 funds
for the one-year period and 2nd out of a total of 6 funds for the five-year
period ended December 31, 2006. Given the size of the Lipper performance
universe and information previously provided by MFS regarding differences
between the Fund and other funds in its Lipper performance universe, the
Trustees also reviewed the Fund's performance in comparison to a custom
benchmark developed by MFS. The Fund out-performed a performance index
designated by MFS for each of the one-year, three-year and five-year periods
ended December 31, 2006 (one-year: 7.29% total return for the Fund versus 4.85%
total return for the performance index; three-year: 7.99% total return for the
Fund versus 4.28% total return for the performance index; five-year: 7.89%
total return for the Fund versus 5.53% total return for the performance index).
Because of the passage of time, these performance results are likely to differ
from the performance results for more recent periods, including those shown
elsewhere in this report.

In the course of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account
information provided by MFS in connection with the contract review meetings, as
well as during investment review meetings conducted with portfolio management
personnel during the course of the year regarding the Fund's performance. After
reviewing these and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the context
of their overall conclusions regarding the investment advisory agreement, that
they were satisfied with MFS' responses and efforts relating to investment
performance.

In assessing the reasonableness of the Fund's advisory fee, the Trustees
considered, among other information, the Fund's advisory fee and the total
expense ratio of the Fund's common shares as a percentage of average daily net
assets and the advisory fee and total expense ratios of peer groups of funds
based on information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS. The Trustees considered
that, according to the Lipper data, the Fund's effective advisory fee rate and
total expense ratio were each higher than the Lipper expense group median.

The Trustees also considered the advisory fees charged by MFS to institutional
accounts. In comparing these fees, the Trustees considered information provided
by MFS as to the generally broader scope of services provided by MFS to the
Fund in comparison to institutional accounts and the impact on MFS and expenses
associated with the more extensive regulatory regime to which the Fund is
subject in comparison to institutional accounts.

The Trustees considered that, as a closed-end fund, the Fund is unlikely to
experience meaningful asset growth. As a result, the Trustees did not view the
potential for realization of economies of scale as the Fund's assets grow to be
a material factor in their deliberations. The Trustees noted that they would
consider economies of scale in the future in the event the Fund experiences
significant asset growth, such as through a material increase in the market
value of the Fund's portfolio securities.

The Trustees also considered information prepared by MFS relating to MFS' costs
and profits with respect to the Fund, the MFS Funds considered as a group, and
other investment companies and accounts advised by MFS, as well as MFS'
methodologies used to determine and allocate its costs to the MFS Funds, the
Fund and other accounts and products for purposes of estimating profitability.

After reviewing these and other factors described herein, the Trustees
concluded, within the context of their overall conclusions regarding the
investment advisory agreement, that the advisory fees charged to the Fund
represent reasonable compensation in light of the services being provided by
MFS to the Fund.

In addition, the Trustees considered MFS' resources and related efforts to
continue to retain, attract and motivate capable personnel to serve the Fund.
The Trustees also considered current and developing conditions in the financial
services industry, including the entry into the industry of large and
well-capitalized companies which are spending, and appear to be prepared to
continue to spend, substantial sums to engage personnel and to provide services
to competing investment companies. In this regard, the Trustees also considered
the financial resources of MFS and its ultimate parent, Sun Life Financial Inc.
The Trustees also considered the advantages and possible disadvantages to the
Fund of having an adviser that also serves other investment companies as well
as other accounts.

The Trustees also considered the nature, quality, cost, and extent of
administrative services provided to the Fund by MFS under agreements other than
the investment advisory agreement. The Trustees also considered the nature,
extent and quality of certain other services MFS performs or arranges for on
the Fund's behalf, which may include securities lending programs, directed
expense payment programs, class action recovery programs, and MFS' interaction
with third-party service providers, principally custodians and sub-custodians.
The Trustees concluded that the various non-advisory services provided by MFS
and its affiliates on behalf of the Funds were satisfactory.

The Trustees also considered benefits to MFS from the use of the Fund's
portfolio brokerage commissions, if applicable, to pay for investment research
(excluding third-party research, for which MFS pays directly) and various other
factors. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called "fall-out benefits" to
MFS such as reputational value derived from serving as investment manager to
the Fund.

Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material, including
those factors described above, the Board of Trustees, including a majority of
the independent Trustees, concluded that the Fund's investment advisory
agreement with MFS should be continued for an additional one-year period,
commencing August 1, 2007.

investment advisory agreement is available by clicking on the fund's name under

ITEM 4(e)(1):
Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and
non-audit related services:

To the extent required by applicable law, pre-approval by the Audit Committee
of the Board is needed for all audit and permissible non-audit services
rendered to the Fund and all permissible non-audit services rendered to MFS or
MFS Related Entities if the services relate directly to the operations and
financial reporting of the Registrant. Pre-approval is currently on an
engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event pre-approval of such services is
necessary between regular meetings of the Audit Committee and it is not
practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the next regular meeting of the Audit
Committee, pre-approval of such services may be referred to the Chair of the
Audit Committee for approval; provided that the Chair may not pre-approve any
individual engagement for such services exceeding $50,000 or multiple
engagements for such services in the aggregate exceeding $100,000 between such
regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement pre-approved by the
Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall be presented for
ratification by the entire Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled
meeting.

ITEM 4(e)(2):
None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and
All Other Fees paid by the Fund and MFS and MFS Related Entities relating
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant disclosed
above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C)
of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after
the start of the engagement with respect to services other than audit, review
or attest services, if certain conditions are satisfied).

ITEM 4(f): Not applicable.

ITEM 4(h): The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the
provision by a Registrant's independent registered public accounting firm of
non-audit services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved
by the Committee (because such services were provided prior to the
effectiveness of SEC rules requiring pre-approval or because such services did
not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Registrant) was compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent
registered public accounting firm as the Registrant's principal auditors.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The Registrant has an Audit Committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The members of the Audit
Committee are Messrs. Robert E. Butler, William R. Gutow, J. Dale Sherratt and
Robert W. Uek and Ms. Laurie J. Thomsen.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

A schedule of investments of the Registrant is included as part of the report
to shareholders of the Registrant under Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Trustees and the Board of Managers of the investment
companies (the "MFS Funds") advised by Massachusetts Financial Services Company
("MFS") have delegated to MFS the right and obligation to vote proxies for
shares that are owned by the MFS Funds, in accordance with MFS' proxy voting
policies and procedures (the "MFS Proxy Policies"). The MFS Proxy Policies are
set forth below:

                    MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                                 MARCH 1, 2007

         Massachusetts Financial Services Company, MFS Institutional Advisors,
Inc. and MFS' other investment adviser subsidiaries (collectively, "MFS") have
adopted proxy voting policies and procedures, as set forth below ("MFS Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures"), with respect to securities owned by the
clients for which MFS serves as investment adviser and has the power to vote
proxies, including the registered investment companies sponsored by MFS, other
than the MFS Union Standard Equity Fund (the "MFS Funds"). References to
"clients" in these policies and procedures include the MFS Funds and other
clients of MFS, such as funds organized offshore, sub-advised funds and
separate account clients, to the extent these clients have delegated to MFS the
responsibility to vote proxies on their behalf under the MFS Proxy Voting
Policies and Procedures.

                  The MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures include:

                  A. Voting Guidelines;

                  B. Administrative Procedures;

                  C. Monitoring System;

                  D. Records Retention; and

                  E. Reports.

    A. VOTING GUIDELINES

1.       GENERAL POLICY; POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         MFS' policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what MFS
believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not
in the interests of any other party or in MFS' corporate interests, including
interests such as the distribution of MFS Fund shares, administration of 401(k)
plans, and institutional relationships.

         MFS periodically reviews matters that are presented for shareholder
vote by either management or shareholders of public companies. Based on the
overall principle that all votes cast by MFS on behalf of its clients must be
in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of such
clients, MFS has adopted proxy voting guidelines, set forth below, that govern
how MFS generally will vote on specific matters presented for shareholder vote.
In all cases, MFS will exercise its discretion in voting on these matters in
accordance with this overall principle. In other words, the underlying
guidelines are simply that - guidelines. Proxy items of significance are often
considered on a case-by-case basis, in light of all relevant facts and
circumstances, and in certain cases MFS may vote proxies in a manner different
from these guidelines.

         As a general matter, MFS maintains a consistent voting position on
similar proxy proposals with respect to various issuers. In addition, MFS
generally votes consistently on the same matter when securities of an issuer
are held by multiple client accounts. However, MFS recognizes that there are
gradations in certain types of proposals that might result in different voting
positions being taken with respect to different proxy statements. There also
may be situations involving matters presented for shareholder vote that are not
governed by the guidelines. Some items that otherwise would be acceptable will
be voted against the proponent when it is seeking extremely broad flexibility
without offering a valid explanation. MFS reserves the right to override the
guidelines with respect to a particular shareholder vote when such an override
is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent with the overall principle of voting
proxies in the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients.

         From time to time, MFS receives comments on these guidelines as well
as regarding particular voting issues from its clients. These comments are
carefully considered by MFS when it reviews these guidelines each year and
revises them as appropriate.

         These policies and procedures are intended to address any potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that are
likely to arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS'
clients. If such potential material conflicts of interest do arise, MFS will
analyze, document and report on such potential material conflicts of interest
(see Sections B.2 and E below), and shall ultimately vote the relevant proxies
in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
clients. The MFS Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for monitoring and
reporting with respect to such potential material conflicts of interest.

2.       MFS' POLICY ON SPECIFIC ISSUES

         ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

         MFS believes that good governance should be based on a board with at
least a simple majority of directors who are "independent" of management, and
whose key committees (e.g., compensation, nominating, and audit committees) are
comprised entirely of "independent" directors. While MFS generally supports the
board's nominees in uncontested elections, we will withhold our vote for, or
vote against, as applicable, a nominee to a board of a U.S. issuer if, as a
result of such nominee being elected to the board, the board would be comprised
of a majority of members who are not "independent" or, alternatively, the
compensation, nominating or audit committees would include members who are not
"independent."

         MFS will also withhold its vote for, or vote against, as applicable, a
nominee to a board if we can determine that he or she failed to attend at least
75% of the board and/or relevant committee meetings in the previous year
without a valid reason stated in the proxy materials. In addition, MFS will
withhold its vote for, or vote against, as applicable, all nominees standing
for re-election to a board if we can determine: (1) since the last annual
meeting of shareholders and without shareholder approval, the board or its
compensation committee has re-priced underwater stock options; or (2) since the
last annual meeting, the board has either implemented a poison pill without
shareholder approval or has not taken responsive action to a majority
shareholder approved resolution recommending that the "poison pill" be
rescinded. Responsive action would include the rescission of the "poison
pill"(without a broad reservation to reinstate the "poison pill" in the event
of a hostile tender offer), or assurance in the proxy materials that the terms
of the "poison pill" would be put to a binding shareholder vote within the next
five to seven years.

              MFS will also withhold its vote for, or vote against, as
applicable, a nominee (other than a nominee who serves as the issuer's Chief
Executive Officer) standing for re-election if such nominee participated (as a
director or committee member) in the approval of a senior executive
compensation package MFS deems to be "excessive." In the event that MFS
determines that an issuer has adopted an "excessive" executive compensation
package, MFS will withhold its vote for, or vote against, as applicable, the
re-election of the issuer's Chief Executive Officer as director regardless of
whether the Chief Executive Officer participated in the approval of the
package. MFS will determine whether a senior executive compensation package is
excessive on a case by case basis. Examples of "excessive" executive
compensation packages include packages that contain egregious employment
contract terms or pension payouts, backdated stock options, overly generous
hiring bonuses for chief executive officers or packages which include excessive
perks.

         MFS evaluates a contested election of directors on a case-by-case
basis considering the long-term financial performance of the company relative
to its industry, management's track record, the qualifications of the nominees
for both slates and an evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders.

         MFS votes for reasonably crafted proposals calling for directors to be
elected with an affirmative majority of votes cast and/or the elimination of
the plurality standard for electing directors (including binding resolutions
requesting that the board amend the company's bylaws), provided the proposal
includes a carve-out for a plurality voting standard when there are more
director nominees than board seats (e.g., contested elections) ("Majority Vote
Proposals").

         MFS considers voting against Majority Vote Proposals if the company
has adopted, or has proposed to adopt in the proxy statement, formal corporate
governance principles that present a meaningful alternative to the majority
voting standard and provide an adequate response to both new nominees as well
as incumbent nominees who fail to receive a majority of votes cast.

         MFS believes that a company's election policy should address the
specific circumstances at that company. MFS considers whether a company's
election policy articulates the following elements to address each director
nominee who fails to receive an affirmative majority of votes cast in an
election:

o Establish guidelines for the process by which the company determines the
  status of nominees who fail to receive an affirmative majority of votes cast
  and disclose the guidelines in the annual proxy statement;

o Guidelines should include a reasonable timetable for resolution of the
  nominee's status and a requirement that the resolution be disclosed together
  with the reasons for the resolution;

o Vest management of the process in the company's independent directors, other
  than the nominee in question; and

o Outline the range of remedies that the independent directors may consider
  concerning the nominee.

         CLASSIFIED BOARDS

         MFS opposes proposals to classify a board (e.g., a board in which
only one-third of board members are elected each year). MFS supports proposals
to declassify a board.

         NON-SALARY COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

         MFS votes against stock option programs for officers, employees or
non-employee directors that do not require an investment by the optionee, that
give "free rides" on the stock price, or that permit grants of stock options
with an exercise price below fair market value on the date the options are
granted.

         MFS also opposes stock option programs that allow the board or the
compensation committee, without shareholder approval, to reprice underwater
options or to automatically replenish shares (i.e., evergreen plans). MFS will
consider on a case-by-case basis proposals to exchange existing options for
newly issued options (taking into account such factors as whether there is a
reasonable value-for-value exchange).

         MFS opposes stock option programs and restricted stock plans that
provide unduly generous compensation for officers, directors or employees, or
could result in excessive dilution to other shareholders. As a general
guideline, MFS votes against restricted stock plans, stock option, non-employee
director, omnibus stock plans and any other stock plan if all such plans for a
particular company involve potential dilution, in the aggregate, of more than
15%. However, MFS may accept a higher percentage (up to 20%) in the case of
startup or small companies which cannot afford to pay large salaries to
executives, or in the case where MFS, based upon the issuer's public
disclosures, believes that the issuer has been responsible with respect to its
recent compensation practices, including the mix of the issuance of restricted
stock and options.

         EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS

         MFS supports shareholder proposals to expense stock options because we
believe that the expensing of options presents a more accurate picture of the
company's financial results to investors. We also believe that companies are
likely to be more disciplined when granting options if the value of stock
options were treated as an expense item on the company's income statements.

         EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         MFS believes that competitive compensation packages are necessary to
attract, motivate and retain executives. Therefore, except as provided in
paragraph 2 above with respect to "excessive compensation" and the election of
directors, MFS opposes shareholder proposals that seek to set restrictions on
executive compensation. MFS also opposes shareholder requests for disclosure on
executive compensation beyond regulatory requirements because we believe that
current regulatory requirements for disclosure of executive compensation are
appropriate and that additional disclosure is often unwarranted and costly.
Although we support linking executive stock option grants to a company's
performance, MFS opposes shareholder proposals that mandate a link of
performance-based options to a specific industry or peer group stock index. MFS
believes that compensation committees should retain the flexibility to propose
the appropriate index or other criteria by which performance-based options
should be measured.

         MFS supports reasonably crafted shareholder proposals that (i) require
the issuer to adopt a policy to recover the portion of performance-based
bonuses and awards paid to senior executives that were not earned based upon a
significant negative restatement of earnings unless the company already has
adopted a clearly satisfactory policy on the matter, or (ii) expressly prohibit
any future backdating of stock options.

         EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS

         MFS supports the use of a broad-based employee stock purchase plans to
increase company stock ownership by employees, provided that shares purchased
under the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of their market value and do
not result in excessive dilution.

         "GOLDEN PARACHUTES"

         From time to time, shareholders of companies have submitted proxy
proposals that would require shareholder approval of severance packages for
executive officers that exceed certain predetermined thresholds. MFS votes in
favor of such shareholder proposals when they would require shareholder
approval of any severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a
certain multiple of such officer's annual compensation that is not determined
in MFS' judgment to be excessive.

         ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES

         In general, MFS votes against any measure that inhibits capital
appreciation in a stock, including proposals that protect management from
action by shareholders. These types of proposals take many forms, ranging from
"poison pills" and "shark repellents" to super-majority requirements.

         MFS will vote for proposals to rescind existing "poison pills" and
proposals that would require shareholder approval to adopt prospective "poison
pills." Nevertheless, MFS will consider supporting the adoption of a
prospective "poison pill" or the continuation of an existing "poison pill" if
we can determine that the following two conditions are met: (1) the "poison
pill" allows MFS clients to hold an aggregate position of up to 15% of a
company's total voting securities (and of any class of voting securities); and
(2) either (a) the "poison pill" has a term of not longer than five years,
provided that MFS will consider voting in favor of the "poison pill" if the
term does not exceed seven years and the "poison pill" is linked to a business
strategy or purpose that MFS believes is likely to result in greater value for
shareholders; or (b) the terms of the "poison pill" allow MFS clients the
opportunity to accept a fairly structured and attractively priced tender offer
(e.g., a "chewable poison pill" that automatically dissolves in the event of an
all cash, all shares tender offer at a premium price).

         MFS will consider on a case-by-case basis proposals designed to
prevent tenders which are disadvantageous to shareholders such as tenders at
below market prices and tenders for substantially less than all shares of an
issuer.

         REINCORPORATION AND REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS

         When presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company under the
laws of a different state, or to effect some other type of corporate
reorganization, MFS considers the underlying purpose and ultimate effect of
such a proposal in determining whether or not to support such a measure. While
MFS generally votes in favor of management proposals that it believes are in
the best long-term economic interests of its clients, MFS may oppose such a
measure if, for example, the intent or effect would be to create additional
inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers.

         ISSUANCE OF STOCK

         There are many legitimate reasons for the issuance of stock.
Nevertheless, as noted above under "Non-Salary Compensation Programs," when a
stock option plan (either individually or when aggregated with other plans of
the same company) would substantially dilute the existing equity (e.g. by
approximately 15% or more), MFS generally votes against the plan. In addition,
MFS votes against proposals where management is asking for authorization to
issue common or preferred stock with no reason stated (a "blank check") because
the unexplained authorization could work as a potential anti-takeover device.
MFS may also vote against the authorization or issuance of common or preferred
stock if MFS determines that the requested authorization is not warranted.

         REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

         MFS supports proposals to institute share repurchase plans in which
all shareholders have the opportunity to participate on an equal basis. Such
plans may include a company acquiring its own shares on the open market, or a
company making a tender offer to its own shareholders.

         CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

         MFS votes in favor of proposals to ensure that shareholder voting
results are kept confidential. For example, MFS supports proposals that would
prevent management from having access to shareholder voting information that is
compiled by an independent proxy tabulation firm.

         CUMULATIVE VOTING

         MFS opposes proposals that seek to introduce cumulative voting and for
proposals that seek to eliminate cumulative voting. In either case, MFS will
consider whether cumulative voting is likely to enhance the interests of MFS'
clients as minority shareholders. In our view, shareholders should provide
names of qualified candidates to a company's nominating committee, which (for
U.S. listed companies) must be comprised solely of "independent" directors.

         WRITTEN CONSENT AND SPECIAL MEETINGS

         Because the shareholder right to act by written consent (without
calling a formal meeting of shareholders) can be a powerful tool for
shareholders, MFS generally opposes proposals that would prevent shareholders
from taking action without a formal meeting or would take away a shareholder's
right to call a special meeting of company shareholders.

         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

         MFS believes that the appointment of auditors for U.S. issuers is best
left to the board of directors of the company and therefore supports the
ratification of the board's selection of an auditor for the company. Some
shareholder groups have submitted proposals to limit the non-audit activities
of a company's audit firm or prohibit any non-audit services by a company's
auditors to that company. MFS opposes proposals recommending the prohibition or
limitation of the performance of non-audit services by an auditor, and
proposals recommending the removal of a company's auditor due to the
performance of non-audit work for the company by its auditor. MFS believes that
the board, or its audit committee, should have the discretion to hire the
company's auditor for specific pieces of non-audit work in the limited
situations permitted under current law.

         OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SOCIAL ISSUES

         There are many groups advocating social change or changes to corporate
governance or corporate responsibility standards, and many have chosen the
publicly-held corporation as a vehicle for advancing their agenda. Generally,
MFS votes with management on such proposals unless MFS can determine that the
benefit to shareholders will outweigh any costs or disruptions to the business
if the proposal were adopted. Common among the shareholder proposals that MFS
generally votes against are proposals requiring the company to use corporate
resources to further a particular social objective outside the business of the
company, to refrain from investing or conducting business in certain countries,
to adhere to some list of goals or principles (e.g., environmental standards),
to disclose political contributions made by the issuer, to separate the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions, or to promulgate special
reports on various activities or proposals for which no discernible shareholder
economic advantage is evident.

         The laws of various states may regulate how the interests of certain
clients subject to those laws (e.g., state pension plans) are voted with
respect to social issues. Thus, it may be necessary to cast ballots differently
for certain clients than MFS might normally do for other clients.

         FOREIGN ISSUERS

         Many of the items on foreign proxies involve repetitive,
non-controversial matters that are mandated by local law. Accordingly, the
items that are generally deemed routine and which do not require the exercise
of judgment under these guidelines (and therefore voted in favor) for foreign
issuers include the following: (i) receiving financial statements or other
reports from the board; (ii) approval of declarations of dividends; (iii)
appointment of shareholders to sign board meeting minutes; (iv) discharge of
management and supervisory boards; and (v) approval of share repurchase
programs.

         MFS generally supports the election of a director nominee standing for
re-election in uncontested elections unless it can be determined that (1) he or
she failed to attend at least 75% of the board and/or relevant committee
meetings in the previous year without a valid reason given in the proxy
materials; (2) since the last annual meeting of shareholders and without
shareholder approval, the board or its compensation committee has re-priced
underwater stock options; or (3) since the last annual meeting, the board has
either implemented a poison pill without shareholder approval or has not taken
responsive action to a majority shareholder approved resolution recommending
that the "poison pill" be rescinded. MFS will also withhold its vote for, or
vote against, as applicable, a director nominee standing for re-election of an
issuer that has adopted an excessive compensation package for its senior
executives as described above in the section entitled "Voting Guidelines-MFS'
Policy on Specific Issues-Election of Directors."

         MFS generally supports the election of auditors, but may determine to
vote against the election of a statutory auditor in certain markets if MFS
reasonably believes that the statutory auditor is not truly independent. MFS
will evaluate all other items on proxies for foreign companies in the context
of the guidelines described above, but will generally vote against an item if
there is not sufficient information disclosed in order to make an informed
voting decision.

         In accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign
companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period
beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the
meeting ("share blocking"). Depending on the country in which a company is
domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the
meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the
company. While practices vary, in many countries the block period can be
continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and
postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability
of a shareholder to have the "block" restriction lifted early (e.g., in some
countries shares generally can be "unblocked" up to two days prior to the
meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be
discretionary with the issuer's transfer agent). Due to these restrictions, MFS
must balance the benefits to its clients of voting proxies against the
potentially serious portfolio management consequences of a reduced flexibility
to sell the underlying shares at the most advantageous time. For companies in
countries with share blocking periods, the disadvantage of being unable to sell
the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages
of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly, MFS will
not vote those proxies in the absence of an unusual, significant vote.

    B. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

1.       MFS PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

         The administration of these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
is overseen by the MFS Proxy Voting Committee, which includes senior personnel
from the MFS Legal and Global Investment Support Departments. The MFS Proxy
Voting Committee:

         a. Reviews these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures at least
            annually and recommends any amendments considered to be necessary
            or advisable;

         b. Determines whether any potential material conflicts of interest
            exist with respect to instances in which (i) MFS seeks to override
            these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures and (ii) votes on
            ballot items not clearly governed by these MFS Proxy Voting
            Policies and Procedures; and

         c. Considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time to time.

2.       POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         The MFS Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for monitoring potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. Any
significant attempt to influence MFS' voting on a particular proxy matter
should be reported to the MFS Proxy Voting Committee.

         In cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these MFS Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, no material conflict of interest will be deemed
to exist. In cases where (i) MFS is considering overriding these MFS Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, or (ii) matters presented for vote are not
governed by these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures, the MFS Proxy
Voting Committee, or delegees, will follow these procedures:

         a. Compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a list of
            significant current and potential (i) distributors of MFS Fund
            shares, (ii) retirement plans administered by MFS or its affiliate
            MFS Retirement Services, Inc. ("RSI"), and (iii) MFS institutional
            clients (the "MFS Significant Client List");

         b. If the name of the issuer does not appear on the MFS Significant
            Client List, then no material conflict of interest will be deemed
            to exist, and the proxy will be voted as otherwise determined by
            the MFS Proxy Voting Committee;

         c. If the name of the issuer appears on the MFS Significant Client
            List, then the MFS Proxy Voting Committee will be apprised of that
            fact and each member of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee will
            carefully evaluate the proposed vote in order to ensure that the
            proxy ultimately is voted in what MFS believes to be the best
            long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not in MFS'
            corporate interests; and

         d. For all potential material conflicts of interest identified under
            clause (c) above, the MFS Proxy Voting Committee will document: the
            name of the issuer, the issuer's relationship to MFS, the analysis
            of the matters submitted for proxy vote, the votes as to be cast
            and the reasons why the MFS Proxy Voting Committee determined that
            the votes were cast in the best long-term economic interests of
            MFS' clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests. A copy of the
            foregoing documentation will be provided to MFS' Conflicts Officer.

        The members of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee are responsible for
creating and maintaining the MFS Significant Client List, in consultation with
MFS' distribution, institutional business units and RSI. The MFS Significant
Client List will be reviewed and updated periodically, as appropriate.

3.       GATHERING PROXIES

         Most proxies received by MFS and its clients originate at Automatic
Data Processing Corp. ("ADP") although a few proxies are transmitted to
investors by corporate issuers through their custodians or depositories. ADP
and issuers send proxies and related material directly to the record holders of
the shares beneficially owned by MFS' clients, usually to the client's
custodian or, less commonly, to the client itself. This material will include
proxy cards, reflecting the shareholdings of Funds and of clients on the record
dates for such shareholder meetings, as well as proxy statements with the
issuer's explanation of the items to be voted upon.


         MFS, on behalf of itself and the Funds, has entered into an agreement
with an independent proxy administration firm, Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. (the "Proxy Administrator"), pursuant to which the Proxy
Administrator performs various proxy vote related administrative services, such
as vote processing and recordkeeping functions for MFS' Funds and institutional
client accounts. The Proxy Administrator receives proxy statements and proxy
cards directly or indirectly from various custodians, logs these materials into
its database and matches upcoming meetings with MFS Fund and client portfolio
holdings, which are input into the Proxy Administrator's system by an MFS
holdings datafeed. Through the use of the Proxy Administrator system, ballots
and proxy material summaries for all upcoming shareholders' meetings are
available on-line to certain MFS employees and the MFS Proxy Voting Committee.

4.       ANALYZING PROXIES

         Proxies are voted in accordance with these MFS Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures. The Proxy Administrator at the prior direction of MFS
automatically votes all proxy matters that do not require the particular
exercise of discretion or judgment with respect to these MFS Proxy Voting
Policies and Procedures as determined by the MFS Proxy Voting Committee. With
respect to proxy matters that require the particular exercise of discretion or
judgment, MFS considers and votes on those proxy matters. MFS receives research
from ISS which it may take into account in deciding how to vote. In addition,
MFS expects to rely on ISS to identify circumstances in which a board may have
approved excessive executive compensation. Representatives of the MFS Proxy
Voting Committee review, as appropriate, votes cast to ensure conformity with
these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.

         As a general matter, portfolio managers and investment analysts have
little or no involvement in specific votes taken by MFS. This is designed to
promote consistency in the application of MFS' voting guidelines, to promote
consistency in voting on the same or similar issues (for the same or for
multiple issuers) across all client accounts, and to minimize the potential
that proxy solicitors, issuers, or third parties might attempt to exert
inappropriate influence on the vote. In limited types of votes (e.g., corporate
actions, such as mergers and acquisitions), a representative of MFS Proxy
Voting Committee may consult with or seek recommendations from portfolio
managers or analysts.(1) However, the MFS Proxy Voting Committee would
ultimately determine the manner in which all proxies are voted.

- -----------
(1) From time to time, due to travel schedules and other commitments, an
    appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst is not available to
    provide a recommendation on a merger or acquisition proposal. If such a
    recommendation cannot be obtained prior to the cut-off date of the
    shareholder meeting, certain members of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee may
    determine to abstain from voting.

         As noted above, MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines when
such an override is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent with the overall
principle of voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
clients. Any such override of the guidelines shall be analyzed, documented and
reported in accordance with the procedures set forth in these policies.

5.       VOTING PROXIES

         In accordance with its contract with MFS, the Proxy Administrator also
generates a variety of reports for the MFS Proxy Voting Committee, and makes
available on-line various other types of information so that the MFS Proxy
Voting Committee may review and monitor the votes cast by the Proxy
Administrator on behalf of MFS' clients.

    C. MONITORING SYSTEM

         It is the responsibility of the Proxy Administrator and MFS' Proxy
Voting Committee to monitor the proxy voting process. When proxy materials for
clients are received, they are forwarded to the Proxy Administrator and are
input into the Proxy Administrator's system. Through an interface with the
portfolio holdings database of MFS, the Proxy Administrator matches a list of
all MFS Funds and clients who hold shares of a company's stock and the number
of shares held on the record date with the Proxy Administrator's listing of any
upcoming shareholder's meeting of that company.

         When the Proxy Administrator's system "tickler" shows that the voting
cut-off date of a shareholders' meeting is approaching, a Proxy Administrator
representative checks that the vote for MFS Funds and clients holding that
security has been recorded in the computer system. If a proxy card has not been
received from the client's custodian, the Proxy Administrator calls the
custodian requesting that the materials be forwarded immediately. If it is not
possible to receive the proxy card from the custodian in time to be voted at
the meeting, MFS may instruct the custodian to cast the vote in the manner
specified and to mail the proxy directly to the issuer.

    D. RECORDS RETENTION

         MFS will retain copies of these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures in effect from time to time and will retain all proxy voting reports
submitted to the Board of Trustees, Board of Directors and Board of Managers of
the MFS Funds for the period required by applicable law. Proxy solicitation
materials, including electronic versions of the proxy cards completed by
representatives of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee, together with their
respective notes and comments, are maintained in an electronic format by the
Proxy Administrator and are accessible on-line by the MFS Proxy Voting
Committee. All proxy voting materials and supporting documentation, including
records generated by the Proxy Administrator's system as to proxies processed,
including the dates when proxy ballots were received and submitted, and the
votes on each company's proxy issues, are retained as required by applicable
law.

    E. REPORTS

         MFS FUNDS

         MFS will report the results of its voting to the Board of Trustees,
Board of Directors and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds. These reports will
include: (i) a summary of how votes were cast; (ii) a review of situations
where MFS did not vote in accordance with the guidelines and the rationale
therefore; (iii) a review of the procedures used by MFS to identify material
conflicts of interest; and (iv) a review of these policies and the guidelines
and, as necessary or appropriate, any proposed modifications thereto to reflect
new developments in corporate governance and other issues. Based on these
reviews, the Trustees, Directors and Managers of the MFS Funds will consider
possible modifications to these policies to the extent necessary or advisable.

         ALL MFS ADVISORY CLIENTS

         At any time, a report can be printed by MFS for each client who has
requested that MFS furnish a record of votes cast. The report specifies the
proxy issues which have been voted for the client during the year and the
position taken with respect to each issue.

         Generally, MFS will not divulge actual voting practices to any party
other than the client or its representatives (unless required by applicable
law) because we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to
the client.

                                                                                   area of MFS since 1993.
</TABLE>

COMPENSATION. Portfolio manager total cash compensation is a combination of
base salary and performance bonus:

    o Base Salary - Base salary represents a smaller percentage of portfolio
      manager total cash compensation (generally below 33%) than incentive
      compensation.

    o Performance Bonus - Generally, incentive compensation represents a
      majority of portfolio manager total cash compensation. The performance
      bonus is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors,
      with more weight given to the former (generally over 60 %) and less
      weight given to the latter.

        >> The quantitative portion is based on pre-tax performance of all of
           the accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the
           Fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a
           one-, three- and five-year period relative to the appropriate Lipper
           peer group universe and/or one or more benchmark indices with
           respect to each account. Primary weight is given to portfolio
           performance over a three-year time period with lesser consideration
           given to portfolio performance over one- and five-year periods
           (adjusted as appropriate if the portfolio manager has served for
           shorter periods).

        >> The qualitative portion is based on the results of an annual
           internal peer review process (conducted by other portfolio managers,
           analysts and traders) and management's assessment of overall
           portfolio manager contributions to investor relations and the
           investment process (distinct from fund and other account
           performance).

Portfolio managers also typically benefit from the opportunity to participate
in the MFS Equity Plan. Equity interests and/or options to acquire equity
interests in MFS or its parent company are awarded by management, on a
discretionary basis, taking into account tenure at MFS, contribution to the
investment process, and other factors.

Finally, portfolio managers are provided with a benefits package including a
defined contribution plan, health coverage and other insurance, which are
available to other employees of MFS on substantially similar terms. The
percentage such benefits represent of any portfolio manager's compensation
depends upon the length of the individual's tenure at MFS and salary level, as
well as other factors.

in the table above.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MFS seeks to identify potential conflicts of
interest resulting from a portfolio manager's management of both the Fund and
other accounts, and has adopted policies and procedures designed to address
such potential conflicts.

The management of multiple funds and accounts (including proprietary accounts)
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and accounts have
different objectives and strategies, benchmarks, time horizons and fees as a
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. In certain instances there may be securities which
are suitable for the Fund's portfolio as well as for accounts of MFS or its
subsidiaries with similar investment objectives. A Fund's trade allocation
policies may give rise to conflicts of interest if the Fund's orders do not get
fully executed or are delayed in getting executed due to being aggregated with
those of other accounts of MFS or its subsidiaries. A portfolio manager may
execute transactions for another fund or account that may adversely impact the
value of the Fund's investments. Investments selected for funds or accounts
other than the Fund may outperform investments selected for the Fund.

When two or more clients are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of
the same security, the securities are allocated among clients in a manner
believed by MFS to be fair and equitable to each. It is recognized that in some
cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Fund is concerned. In most cases, however, MFS believes
that the Fund's ability to participate in volume transactions will produce
better executions for the Fund.

MFS does not receive a performance fee for its management of the Fund. As a
result, MFS and/or a portfolio manager may have a financial incentive to
allocate favorable or limited opportunity investments or structure the timing
of investments to favor accounts other than the Fund - for instance, those that
pay a higher advisory fee and/or have a performance fee.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase shares annually.
The notification to shareholders of the program is part of the semi-annual and
annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs begin on March 1st
of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the
securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of shares that
may be purchased in each annual period (March 1 through the following February
28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the first day of the
plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of shares available for purchase for
the March 1, 2007 plan year is 4,016,342.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act
    of 1940 (the "Act")) as conducted within 90 days of the filing date of
    this Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal financial officer and
    principal executive officer have concluded that those disclosure controls
    and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the material information
    required to be disclosed by the registrant on this report is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
    the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter covered by the report that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

    (1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit: Code of Ethics attached hereto.
    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2
        under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.
    (3) Any written solicitation to purchase securities under Rule 23c-1 under
        the Act sent or given during the period covered by the report by or on
        behalf of the Registrant to 10 or more persons. Not applicable.

(b) If the report is filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
    provide the certifications required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act (17 CFR
    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title
    18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r),
    or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such certification
    will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under
    the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that
    the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference: Attached hereto.

                                            SEPTEMBER, 2005 AND NOVEMBER, 2005)

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the
"Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

         o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
           or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
           relationships;

         o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
           reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
           Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
           communications made by the Funds;

         o compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
           and regulations;

         o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
           appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.      CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer
should not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests
and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Covered Officer must:

         o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
           improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
           for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
           the detriment of the Fund; and

         o not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
           individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
           benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o running for political office;

         o the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
           has current or prospective business dealings unless such
           entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
           as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
           of impropriety;

         o any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
           relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
           banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
           principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
           thereof;

         o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
           charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
           transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
           interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
           ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
           disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
           others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
           or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
           and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
           her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
           employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
           full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
           reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
           in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
           compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
           standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
           regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
           becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
           or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
           with the requirements of the Code;

         o annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
           or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
           Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
           Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
           employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
           potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
           Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or
other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this
Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

     b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
