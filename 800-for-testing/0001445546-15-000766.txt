                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are
spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information, this
report and other Fund regulatory filings.

   FCT PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2014

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
The primary investment objective of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may
not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

The last six months were generally strong for the senior loan and high yield
market despite the volatility towards the end of the period in late September
and early October. For the first time in quite a while, a healthy dose of
volatility was introduced into various markets. The volatility was driven
largely by geopolitical headlines, including Russia/Ukraine, Gaza, the Banco
Espirito Santo bailout and the Argentine default. More importantly for
fixed-income investors, with the Federal Reserve's (the "Fed") unprecedented
stimulus program now complete, investor attention has begun to shift toward 2015
and the timing of the first interest rate increase. Interest rates have indeed
been volatile as evidenced by the fact that after setting a 12-month high on
December 31, 2013 at 3.03%, 10-year Treasury yields were below 2.00% intra-day
in a volatile October market and closed November at 2.17%.

SENIOR LOAN MARKET

The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index returned 0.86% for the six-month period ended
November 30, 2014. From a credit-quality perspective, higher-rated credit issues
provided the strongest performance for the period. Lower-quality CCC rated
issues returned 0.80% in the period, underperforming the returns of higher
quality B rated issues at 1.10% and BB rated issues at 1.15%. The average price
of loans in the market began the period at $98.80, and after peaking at $99.00
at the end of June, loan prices ended the period down slightly at $97.50.

CREDIT QUALITY/DEFAULT RATES

Despite the widely anticipated default of TXU, the largest senior loan debt
issuer and a large high-yield bond issuer, default rates remain tight to
long-term averages. We believe this is because corporate fundamentals remain
healthy, as evidenced by the fact that senior loan issuers that file their
financial results publicly grew cash flows by approximately 9% year-over-year in
the second quarter of 2014 (latest data available), which represents 20 straight
quarters of cash flow growth.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund outperformed the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index on a net asset value
("NAV") basis for the six-month period ended November 30, 2014. The Fund
generated a return of 1.28% at NAV and a market price return of -3.48%. The
Fund's market price return was impacted by the Fund's discount to NAV widening
over the six-month period. This discount widening was not specific to the Fund,
but something seen broadly across the closed-end fund market. At the start of
the period, the Fund's market price was at a 6.35% discount to NAV, and moved to
a 10.76% discount to NAV by the end of the period.


                                                                          Page 3

PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY (CONTINUED)

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                               SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT
                               NOVEMBER 30, 2014

From an income perspective, the monthly announced distribution rate began the
period at $0.07125 per share and ended at $0.068 per share. The consequence of
robust demand for senior loans has been declining yields. This trend has
resulted in a lower income profile for the Fund and is the primary reason for
the distribution decrease. At the $0.068 per share monthly distribution rate,
the annualized distribution rate at the end of November 2014 was 5.55% at NAV
and 6.22% at market price.

Leverage as of November 30, 2014 was approximately 30.4%. During the six-month
period ended November 30, 2014, leverage had a negative impact on the Fund's
capital appreciation, but a positive impact on income. The Fund's relatively
conservative credit quality also positively impacted performance as CCC rated
issues lagged the market return for the six-month period. At the end of the
period, the Fund held 6.75% of assets in issues rated CCC or below compared to
7.25% for the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

Credit markets appear well positioned for the intermediate term, in our opinion.
We believe the combination of attractive valuations, a modest default
environment, better economic growth and sound corporate fundamentals provides a
firm backdrop for returns in the periods ahead. We continue to believe that
steadily improving economic data will provide the Fed the motivation it requires
to begin the process of raising interest rates in the second half of 2015. In
the interim, recent volatility in the market has largely been technically
induced (supply/demand imbalance). This is in stark contrast to volatility that
is fundamentally induced, when company financial performance is showing signs of
weakness. We believe that technically induced volatility, which we have
experienced in the third calendar quarter, tends to lead to opportunities for
patient investors. A healthy dose of volatility typically means that risks are
priced more attractively, and price levels may be lower than the fundamentals
would warrant.

As we evaluate new investment opportunities, decisions will continue to be
rooted in our rigorous bottom-up credit analysis and focus on the opportunities
that we believe offer the best risk and reward balance for the Fund. Despite the
many distractions and market conditions that ebb and flow every quarter, we
remain firmly focused on finding value in the high-yield bond and senior loan
markets.

</TABLE>


(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest at rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime
      rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the certificate
      of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR floor that
      establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown reflects the
      rate in effect at November 30, 2014. When a range of rates is disclosed
      the Fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche at varying
      rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   This issuer has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(e)   This issuer is in default but interest is still being accrued by the Fund
      and paid by the issuer.

(f)   This security, sold within the terms of a private placement memorandum, is
      exempt from registration upon resale under Rule 144A under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended, and may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. Pursuant to
      procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this security has been
      determined to be liquid by First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's advisor.
      Although market instability can result in periods of increased overall
      market illiquidity, liquidity for each security is determined based on
      security specific factors and assumptions, which require subjective
      judgment. At November 30, 2014, securities noted as such are valued at
      $12,586,250 or 3.21% of net assets.

(g)   These notes are Payment-in-Kind ("PIK") Toggle Notes ("Notes") whereby the
      issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on the Notes (1) entirely
      in cash or (2) entirely in PIK interest. Interest paid in cash will accrue
      at the rate of 10% per annum ("Cash Interest Rate") and PIK interest will
      accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum equal to the Cash Interest Rate
      plus 2%. During the period, this security paid interest in cash.

(h)   Floating rate security. The interest rate shown reflects the rate in
      effect at November 30, 2014.

(i)   This security is fair valued by the Advisor's Pricing Committee in
      accordance with procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in
      accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
      amended.

(j)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Prior
      to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions
      exempt from registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes
      to Financial Statements).

(k)   Non-income producing security.

(l)   Aggregate cost for financial reporting purposes, which approximates the
      aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes. As of November 30, 2014,
      the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities in which
      there was an excess of value over tax cost was $1,121,286 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $8,226,096.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


                                1. ORGANIZATION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior
floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans").1 There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in absence of market
value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value. Market value
prices represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or foreign
exchange (i.e., a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from third party
pricing services. Fair value prices represent any prices not considered market
value prices and are either obtained from a third party pricing service or are
determined by the Pricing Committee of the Fund's investment advisor, First
Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust" or the "Advisor") in accordance with
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with provisions of the 1940 Act. Investments valued by the Advisor's Pricing
Committee, if any, are footnoted as such in the footnotes to the Portfolio of
Investments. The Fund's investments are valued as follows:

      Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
      exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
      institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
      that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
      although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while
      having grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades
      and less liquidity than the secondary market for other types of
      securities. Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade
      infrequently, and information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be
      widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the
      fair market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent and dated
      information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
      elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans
      than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are fair
      valued using information provided by a third party pricing service. The
      third party pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from
      dealer runs and broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior
      Loans.

      Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or
      foreign exchange (excluding The NASDAQ(R) Stock Market, LLC ("NASDAQ") and
      the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are
      valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which they are
      principally traded or, for NASDAQ and AIM securities, the official closing
      price. Securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued
      at the last sale price or official closing price, as applicable, at the
      close of the securities exchange representing the principal market for
      such securities.

      Corporate bonds, corporate notes and other debt securities are fair valued
      on the basis of valuations provided by dealers who make markets in such
      securities or by an independent pricing service approved by the Fund's
      Board of Trustees, which may use the following valuation inputs when
      available:

      1)    benchmark yields;
      2)    reported trades;
      3)    broker/dealer quotes;


(1)   The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.


                                                                         Page 23

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


      4)    issuer spreads;
      5)    benchmark securities;
      6)    bids and offers; and
      7)    reference data including market research publications.

      Fixed income and other debt securities having a remaining maturity of 60
      days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost adjusted for
      amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts (amortized cost),
      provided the Advisor's Pricing Committee has determined that the use of
      amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value given market and
      issuer specific conditions existing at the time of the determination.
      Factors that may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the
      use of amortized cost include, but are not limited to, the following:

      1)    the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      2)    the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      3)    the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and changes
            thereto (such as significant changes in interest rates);
      4)    issuer-specific conditions (such as significant credit
            deterioration); and
      5)    any other market-based data the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            considers relevant. In this regard, the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            may use last-obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing
            portfolio securities using amortized cost.

Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate, the Advisor's Pricing Committee, at fair value. These securities
generally include, but are not limited to, restricted securities (securities
which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended) for which a pricing service is unable to provide a market
price; securities whose trading has been formally suspended; a security whose
market or fair value price is not available from a pre-established pricing
source; a security with respect to which an event has occurred that is likely to
materially affect the value of the security after the market has closed but
before the calculation of the Fund's NAV or make it difficult or impossible to
obtain a reliable market quotation; and a security whose price, as provided by
the pricing service, does not reflect the security's fair value. As a general
principle, the current fair value of a security would appear to be the amount
which the owner might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its
current sale. When fair value prices are used, generally they will differ from
market quotations or official closing prices on the applicable exchanges. A
variety of factors may be considered in determining the fair value of such
securities, including, but not limited to, the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;
      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;
      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;
      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;
      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;
      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;
      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;
      8)    the coupon payments;
      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;
     10)    the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;
     11)    the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;
     12)    borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;
     13)    borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and
     14)    other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of November 30, 2014, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward purchase commitments as of
November 30, 2014.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had no unfunded delayed draw loan commitments as
of November 30, 2014.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Prior to registration, restricted
securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from registration under
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified institutional buyers. As of
November 30, 2014, the Fund held restricted securities as shown in the following
table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. These securities are valued according to the valuation procedures as
stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a
discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There
are no unrestricted investments with the same maturity date and yield for this
issuer.

*     Amount is less than 0.01%.


E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2014 is as follows:


         Distributions paid from:
         Ordinary income...................................    $  25,186,591



                                                                         Page 25

                                                               =============

F. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years after December 31, 2010, may be
carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term
and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for
up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the
Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment
net capital losses. At May 31, 2014, the Fund had pre-enactment net capital
losses for federal income tax purposes of $98,951,987 expiring as follows:

                    EXPIRATION DATE          AMOUNT
                    May 31, 2016          $    422,155
                    May 31, 2017          $ 25,585,953
                    May 31, 2018          $ 68,278,827
                    May 31, 2019          $  4,665,052

During the taxable year ended May 31, 2014, the Fund utilized pre-enactment
capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $689,527.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

Certain losses realized during the current fiscal year may be deferred and
treated as occurring the first day of the following fiscal year for Federal
Income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, the Fund incurred
and elected to defer net ordinary and capital losses as follows:

Qualified Late Year Losses:

Ordinary Losses    $         --
Capital Losses        3,099,237

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2011, 2012,
2013 and 2014 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2014,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. The Charger Corporation is an Illinois corporation
controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First Trust. First
Trust is responsible for the selection and ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee
calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets (the average
daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's liabilities
other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also provides fund
reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount of $9,250.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNYM IS") serves as the Fund's
administrator, fund accountant and transfer agent in accordance with certain fee
arrangements. As administrator and fund accountant, BNYM IS is responsible for
providing certain administrative and accounting services to the Fund, including
maintaining the Fund's books of account, records of the Fund's securities
transactions, and certain other books and records. As transfer agent, BNYM IS is
responsible for maintaining shareholder records for the Fund. The Bank of New
York Mellon ("BNYM") serves as the Fund's custodian in accordance with certain
fee arrangements. As custodian, BNYM is responsible for custody of the Fund's
assets.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any Sub-Advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer that is allocated pro rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund
Complex based on net assets. Each Independent Trustee is also paid an annual per
fund fee that varies based on whether the fund is a closed-end or other actively
managed fund, or is an index fund.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee and the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee are paid
annual fees to serve in such capacities, with such compensation allocated pro
rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.
Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and Committee Chairmen rotate every
three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no compensation from
the Fund for acting in such capacities.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2014, were $196,171,488 and
$194,954,332, respectively.

                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Facility")
with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as
secondary lender and agent for the secured parties under the agreement. The
Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the terms of the
Credit Facility, the loans under the Credit Facility bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
conduit lender. Effective July 11, 2014, the Credit Facility was amended,
whereby the expiration date of the Credit Facility was extended until July 10,
2015 and the total commitment was reduced from $190,000,000 to $185,000,000. The
Credit Facility may be renewed annually. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act,
the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of
at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The Fund
pays a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.3625% (prior to July 11, 2014,
the per annum rate was 0.35%) of the daily average of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the advances during the prior calendar month, and a
commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i) 0.3625% (prior to July
11, 2014, the per annum rate was 0.35%) of the daily average of the total
commitment in effect (or if terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the advances funded or maintained) during the preceding calendar month
and (ii) 1.02.

For the six months ended November 30, 2014, the average amount outstanding under
the Credit Facility was $170,426,230. The high and low annual interest rates for
the loan under the Credit Facility funded by the conduit lender during the six
months ended November 30, 2014, were 0.205% and 0.199%, respectively, with a
weighted average interest rate of 0.202%. The annual interest rate in effect for
the loan at November 30, 2014, was 0.205%.

                           6. COMMON SHARE OFFERINGS

On November 21, 2012, the Fund and the Advisor entered into a sales agreement
with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC ("JonesTrading") whereby the Fund
may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 Common Shares from time to time through
JonesTrading as agent for the offer and sale of the Common Shares. Effective
August 22, 2013, the sales agreement with JonesTrading was amended and as a
result, the Fund may offer and sell up to 4,225,967 Common Shares. Sales of
Common Shares pursuant to the sales agreement may be made in negotiated
transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" as defined in
Rule 415 under the 1933 Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales
made through a market maker other than on an exchange, at an offering price
equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share of the Fund's Common
Shares at the time such Common Shares are initially sold. The Fund intends to
use the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares in accordance with its
investment objectives and policies. Transactions related to offerings under such
sales agreement are as follows:

                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


Estimated offering costs of $235,169 related to the November 21, 2012 offering
were recorded as a prepaid asset and were amortized to expense by the Fund on a
straight line basis over a one year period. Additionally, on August 23, 2013,
estimated offering costs of $175,000 related to the offering were recorded as a
prepaid asset and were amortized to expense by the Fund on a straight line basis
over a one year period. During the period ended November 30, 2014, it was
determined that actual offering costs were less than the estimated offering
costs by $92,925. Therefore, offering costs were reduced by that amount in the
period ended November 30, 2014, as reflected in the At the market offering cost
line item on the Statement of Operations.

                               7. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

On December 22, 2014, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.072 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on January 6, 2015, payable January 15, 2015.

On January 20, 2015, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.072 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on February 4, 2015, payable February 17, 2015.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree. High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and
risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an
issuer's creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the
default by an issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for
high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade
securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid,

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan
to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral
underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in
the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral
may not be readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK: Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK: The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. If the economy
experiences a sudden downturn, or if the debt markets for such companies become
distressed, the Fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in
sufficient amounts, at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner to
raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by
Fund shareholders.

                        INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING APPROVAL OF CONTINUATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
AGREEMENT

The Board of Trustees of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the
"Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved the
continuation of the Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement") between
the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") at a meeting held on June
8-9, 2014. The Board of Trustees determined that the continuation of the
Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund in light of the extent and
quality of the services provided and such other matters as the Board considered
to be relevant in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as well as under
the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory
contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty
of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in voting
on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreement, the
Independent Trustees received a report from the Advisor in advance of the Board
meeting responding to a request for information from counsel to the Independent
Trustees. The report, among other things, outlined the services provided by the
Advisor (including the relevant personnel responsible for these services and
their experience); the advisory fees for the Fund as compared to fees charged to
other clients of the Advisor and as compared to fees charged by investment
advisors to comparable funds; expenses of the Fund as compared to expense ratios
of comparable funds; the nature of expenses incurred in providing services to
the Fund and the potential for economies of scale, if any; financial data on the
Advisor; any fall out benefits to the Advisor; and information on the Advisor's
compliance program. Following receipt of this information, counsel to the
Independent Trustees posed follow-up questions to the Advisor, and the
Independent Trustees and their counsel met separately to discuss the information
provided by the Advisor, including the supplemental responses. The Board applied
its business judgment to determine whether the arrangement between the Fund and
the Advisor is a reasonable business arrangement from the Fund's perspective as
well as from the perspective of shareholders. The Board considered that
shareholders chose to invest or remain invested in the Fund knowing that the
Advisor manages the Fund.

In reviewing the Agreement, the Board considered the nature, extent and quality
of services provided by the Advisor under the Agreement. The Board considered
that the Advisor is responsible for the overall management and administration of
the Fund and reviewed the services provided by the Advisor to the Fund, noting
that the Advisor's Leveraged Finance Investment Team is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Fund's investments. The Board considered the
Advisor's statement that it applies the same oversight model internally with its
Leveraged Finance Investment Team as it uses for overseeing external
sub-advisors. The Board considered the background and experience of the members
of the Leveraged Finance Investment Team. At the meeting, the Board received a
presentation from members of the Leveraged Finance Investment Team, who
discussed the services that the Team provides to the Fund and how the Team
manages the


                                                                         Page 31

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


Fund's investments. The Board noted the compliance program that had been
developed by the Advisor and considered that it includes a robust program for
monitoring compliance with the 1940 Act and the Fund's investment objectives and
policies. In light of the information presented and the considerations made, the
Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of services provided to the
Fund by the Advisor under the Agreement have been and are expected to remain
satisfactory and that the Advisor has managed the Fund consistent with its
investment objectives and policies.

The Board considered the advisory fees paid under the Agreement. The Board
considered the advisory fees charged by the Advisor to similar funds and other
non-fund clients, noting that the Advisor does not provide advisory services to
other closed-end funds with investment objectives and policies similar to the
Fund's, but it does provide services to an actively managed exchange-traded fund
("ETF") with investment objectives and policies similar to the Fund's. The Board
noted that the Advisor charges a unitary fee to the actively managed ETF from
which it pays most of the ETF's expenses. In addition, the Board reviewed data
prepared by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent source, showing the advisory
fees and expense ratios of the Fund as compared to the advisory fees and expense
ratios of an expense peer group selected by Lipper and similar data from the
Advisor for a separate peer group selected by the Advisor. The Board noted that
all of the Lipper expense peer group funds were included in the Advisor peer
group. The Board discussed with representatives of the Advisor the limitations
in creating a relevant peer group for the Fund, including that (i) the Fund is
unique in its composition, which makes assembling peers with similar strategies
and asset mix difficult, noting that some peer funds have significant holdings
outside of senior loans; (ii) peer funds may use different amounts and types of
leverage which have different costs associated with them or may use no leverage;
and (iii) some of the peer funds are larger than the Fund, which causes the
Fund's fixed expenses to be higher on a percentage basis as compared to the
larger peer funds. The Board took these limitations into account in considering
the peer data. The Board also noted that certain one-time expenses related to an
at-the-market offering of additional common shares paid by the Fund in 2013
affected the Fund's expense ratio relative to its peers. In reviewing the peer
data, the Board noted that the Fund's contractual advisory fee was equal to the
median of the Lipper peer group.

The Board also considered performance information for the Fund, noting that the
performance information included the Fund's quarterly performance report, which
is part of the process that the Board has established for monitoring the Fund's
performance and portfolio risk on an ongoing basis. The Board determined that
this process continues to be effective for reviewing the Fund's performance. In
addition to the Board's ongoing review of performance, the Board also received
data prepared by Lipper comparing the Fund's performance to a performance peer
universe selected by Lipper and to two benchmarks. In reviewing the Fund's
performance as compared to the performance of the Lipper peer universe, the
Board took into account the limitations described above with respect to creating
a relevant peer group for the Fund. The Board also noted that the Advisor's
Leveraged Finance Investment Team did not begin managing the day-to-day
investment of the Fund's assets until October 2010. The Board also considered
the Fund's dividend yield as of March 31, 2014 and information provided by the
Advisor on the Fund's leverage, including that leverage was accretive to the
Fund's total return in 2013. In addition, the Board compared the Fund's
premium/discount over the past eight quarters to the average and median
premium/discount of the Advisor peer group over the same period and considered
the factors that may impact a fund's premium/discount.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, the Board concluded that the advisory fees were
reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature, extent and quality of
services provided by the Advisor under the Agreement.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure and considered whether fee levels reflect any economies of scale
for the benefit of shareholders. The Board determined that due to the Fund's
closed-end structure, the potential for realization of economies of scale as
Fund assets grow was not a material factor to be considered. The Board also
considered the costs of the services provided and profits realized by the
Advisor from serving as investment advisor to the Fund for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2013, as well as product-line profitability data for the same
period, as set forth in the materials provided to the Board. The Board noted the
inherent limitations in the profitability analysis, and concluded that the
Advisor's estimated profitability appeared to be not excessive in light of the
services provided to the Fund. In addition, the Board considered fall-out
benefits described by the Advisor that may be realized from its relationship
with the Fund, including the Advisor's compensation for fund reporting services
pursuant to a separate Fund Reporting Services Agreement.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously determined that the terms
of the Agreement continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of
the Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.
