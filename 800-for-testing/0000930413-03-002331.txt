(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
determined by subtracting the initial  investment  from the redeemable  value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and
expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income
dividends  and capital gain  distributions  by the Fund have been  reinvested at
prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan.  Total investment
return does not reflect broker commissions or sales charges.  Total return for a
period of less than one year is not annualized.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative  minimum tax.  Closed-end  funds,  unlike  open-end  funds,  are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market  Price Yield is  determined  by  dividing  the  annualized  per share
dividend payable to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

(1) Inclusive of net assets to attributable Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
determined by subtracting the initial  investment  from the redeemable  value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and
expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income
dividends  and capital gain  distributions  by the Fund have been  reinvested at
prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan.  Total investment
return does not reflect broker commissions or sales charges.  Total return for a
period of less than one year is not annualized.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative  minimum tax.  Closed-end  funds,  unlike  open-end  funds,  are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market  Price Yield is  determined  by  dividing  the  annualized  per share
dividend payable to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
May 31, 2003


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PIMCO Municipal  Income Fund II ("Municipal  II"),  PIMCO  California  Municipal
Income Fund II ("California  Municipal II") and PIMCO New York Municipal  Income
Fund II ("New York  Municipal  II")  collectively  referred to as the "Funds" or
"PIMCO  Municipal  Income Funds II", were  organized as  Massachusetts  business
trusts on March 29, 2002.  Prior to commencing  operations on June 28, 2002, the
Funds had no operations  other than matters  relating to their  organization and
registration as closed-end  management investment companies registered under the
Investment  Company  Act of 1940 and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  as
amended,  and the sale and  issuance of 6,981 shares of  beneficial  interest of
each  Fund at an  aggregate  purchase  price of  $100,003  per  Fund to  Allianz
Dresdner  Asset  Management  of America  L.P.,  ("ADAM").  PIMCO  Advisors  Fund
Management  LLC, (the  "Investment  Manager"),  serves as the Fund's  Investment
Manager  and  is an  indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  ADAM.  ADAM  is an
indirect,  majority-owned  subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Funds have an unlimited
amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

Municipal II invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of municipal
bonds,  the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes.  California
Municipal II invests  substantially  all of its assets in municipal  bonds which
pay interest that is exempt from federal and California  income taxes.  New York
Municipal II invests  substantially  all of its assets in municipal  bonds which
pay  interest  that is exempt  from  federal,  New York  State and New York City
income  taxes.  The Funds will seek to avoid bonds  generating  interest  income
which could  potentially  subject  individuals to  alternative  minimum tax. The
issuers'  abilities  to meet their  obligations  may be affected by economic and
political developments in a specific state or region.

Municipal  II,  California  Municipal  II  and  New  York  Municipal  II  issued
50,500,000,  26,000,000 and 9,000,000 shares of common stock,  respectively,  in
their initial public offerings. An additional 7,001,148, 3,900,000 and 1,294,833
shares of  Municipal  II,  California  Municipal II and New York  Municipal  II,
respectively,  were issued in connection with the exercises of the underwriters'
over-allotment option on July 15, 2002 and August 6, 2002. These shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting  discount of $0.675 per share.
The Investment Manager has agreed to reimburse the amount by which the aggregate
of each Fund's  organizational and offering cost (other than sales load) exceeds
$0.03  per  share.   Offering  costs  of   $1,174,197,   $682,616  and  $308,845
(representing  $0.02 per share for Municipal II and California  Municipal II and
$0.03 per share for New York  Municipal II), were offset against the proceeds of
the offerings and have been charged to paid-in capital in excess of par.

In addition,  the  underwriters  discount and offering costs associated with the
Funds'  issuance of Preferred  Shares in the amounts of $5,050,000 and $366,317,
$2,600,000 and $269,348 and $900,000 and $149,609,  for Municipal II, California
Municipal  II and New York  Municipal  II,  respectively,  have been  charged to
paid-in capital in excess of par.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates. In the normal course of business the Funds enter into contracts
that   contain   a   variety   of   representations    which   provide   general
indemnifications.  The Funds'  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown as this would  involve  future claims that may be made against the Funds
that have not yet occurred. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be
remote.

The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting  policies  consistently
followed by the Funds:

(a) VALUATION OF  INVESTMENTS

Portfolio  securities  and other assets for which market  quotations are readily
available  are  valued  each day at  market  value.  Market  value is  generally
determined  on the basis of the last  reported  sales price,  or if no sales are
reported,   based  on  quotes  obtained  from  a  quotation   reporting  system,
established market makers, or independent pricing services approved by the Board
of Trustees.  Any security or other asset for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  is valued at fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures established by the Board of Trustees.

(b) FEDERAL  INCOME TAXES

The Funds intend to distribute  all of their  taxable  income and to comply with
the other  requirements of the U.S.  Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of their taxable  ordinary  income and long-term  capital gains,  if any, during
each calendar  year,  the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S.  federal excise
tax.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
May 31, 2003


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(c) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt  securities  purchased  are  accreted  or  amortized  daily to  non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON  STOCK

The  Funds  declare  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least  annually.   Each  Fund  records   dividends  and   distributions  to  its
shareholders on the ex-dividend  date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net  investment  income and net realized  capital  gains are  determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations,  which may differ from generally
accepted  accounting   principles.   These  "book-tax"  differences  are  either
considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature,  such amounts are reclassified  within the capital accounts
based on their  federal  income  tax  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not
require  reclassification.  To the extent dividends and/or  distributions exceed
current and  accumulated  earnings  and profits for federal  income tax purposes
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess
of par.

(e) CUSTODY  CREDITS  EARNED ON CASH  BALANCES

The Funds benefit from an expense offset  arrangement  with their custodian bank
whereby  uninvested  cash balances earn credits which reduce  monthly  custodian
expenses.  Had these cash balances been invested in income producing securities,
they would have generated income for the Funds.

(f) FUTURES  CONTRACTS

A  futures  contract  is an  agreement  between  two  parties  to buy and sell a
financial  instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract,  the Funds are  required  to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum  "initial margin"  requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts,  the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily  fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such  receipts or payments are known as  "variation  margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation.  When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the  contracts  at the time they were  opened  and the value at the
time they were closed. Any unrealized  appreciation or depreciation  recorded is
simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves the risk of an
imperfect  correlation  in the  movements  in the  price of  futures  contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets,  and the possible  inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

Futures contracts outstanding at May 31, 2003 were as follows:

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

(g) OPTION TRANSACTIONS

For  hedging  purposes,  the Funds may  purchase  and write  (sell) put and call
options on Municipal Bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements, indexes
or  futures  contracts  which are  standardized  and  traded on a U.S.  or other
exchange,  boards of  trade,  or  similar  entity,  or  quoted  on an  automated
quotation  system.  The risk  associated  with  purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium  whether or not the option is exercised.  Additionally,  the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium  and  change in market  value  should the
counterparty not perform under the contract.  Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities.

The  cost of  securities  acquired  through  the  exercise  of call  options  is
increased by the premiums paid.  The proceeds from the  securities  sold through
the exercise of put options is decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written,  the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability  which is  subsequently  adjusted to the current market value of
the  option  written.  Premiums  received  from  writing  options  which  expire
unexercised  are  recorded  on the  expiration  date  as a  realized  gain.  The
difference  between the  premium  received  and the amount  paid on  effecting a
closing purchase transaction,  including brokerage commissions,  is also treated
as a realized  gain,  or if the  premium  is less than the  amount  paid for the
closing  purchase  transactions,  as a  realized  loss.  If  a  call  option  is
exercised,  the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is  exercised,  the premium  reduces the cost basis of the  security.  In
writing an option,  the Funds bear the market risk of an  unfavorable  change in
the price of the security  underlying the written option.  Exercise of an option
written  could result in the Funds  purchasing  a security at a price  different
from the current market price.

Transactions in options written for the period ended May 31, 2003 were:

                                                      Contracts         Premiums

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER

Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreements")
with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to each Fund. Subject
to the supervision by each Fund's Board of Trustees,  the Investment  Manager is
responsible for managing,  either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment  activities  of the Fund and the Fund's  business  affairs  and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,  the Investment Manager will
receive an annual  fee,  payable  monthly,  at the annual  rate of 0.65% of each
Fund's  average  daily net  assets  (including  net assets  attributable  to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order to reduce Fund expenses, the
Investment Manager has contractually  agreed to reimburse each Fund for fees and
expenses  at the  annual  rate of 0.15% of the Fund's  average  daily net assets
(including  net  assets  attributable  to  any  preferred  shares  that  may  be
outstanding) from the commencement of operations  through June 30, 2007, and for
a declining amount thereafter through June 30, 2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment Management
Company LLC (the  "Sub-Adviser") to manage each Fund's  investments.  Subject to
the supervision of the Investment Manager,  the Sub-Adviser makes all investment
decisions  with respect to each Fund's assets.  The Investment  Manager (not the
Funds) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the  Sub-Adviser  in return for
its services,  at the maximum  annual rate of 0.50% of each Fund's average daily
net assets

(including net assets  attributable to any preferred shares that may
be outstanding).  The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of
the fees it is entitled to receive from the  Investment  Manager,  such that the
Sub-Adviser  will  receive  0.26%  of  each  Fund's  average  daily  net  assets
(including  net  assets  attributable  to  any  preferred  shares  that  may  be
outstanding)  from the  commencement of the Funds'  operations  through June 30,
2007, and will receive an increasing  amount (not to exceed 0.50% of each Fund's
average  daily net assets,  including net assets  attributable  to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding) thereafter through June 30, 2009. The Investment
Manager informed the Funds that it paid the Sub-Adviser  $3,022,340,  $1,556,737

matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

(1) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock at
    the  current  market  price on the first day of the period and a sale at the
    current market price on the last day for the period reported.  Dividends and
    distributions  are  assumed,  for  purposes  of  this  calculation,   to  be
    reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan.
    Total  investment  return does not reflect  brokerage  commissions  or sales
    charges.  Total investment  return for a period of less than one year is not
    annualized.

(2) Calculated on the basis of income and expenses applicable to both common and
    preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common shareholders.

(3) Inclusive  of  expenses  offset by  custody  credits on cash  balances  from
    custodian bank. (See note 1(e) in Notes to Financial Statements).

(4) Annualized.

(5) During the period indicated  above, the Investment  Manager waived a portion
    of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in effect, the
    ratio of  expenses  to average  net  assets and the ratio of net  investment
    income to average net assets  would have been 1.18%  (annualized)  and 6.76%
    (annualized), respectively.

(6) During the period indicated  above, the Investment  Manager waived a portion
    of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in effect, the
    ratio of  expenses  to average  net  assets and the ratio of net  investment

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of
PIMCO Municipal Income Fund II, PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund II and
PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund II


In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations and of
changes  in net  assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  and the  financial
highlights present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of
PIMCO Municipal  Income Fund II, PIMCO  California  Municipal Income Fund II and
PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund II (collectively  hereafter  referred to as
the "Funds") at May 31, 2003, and the results of each of their  operations,  the
changes in each of their net assets  applicable to common  shareholders  and the
financial  highlights for the period June 28, 2002  (commencement of operations)
through  May 31,  2003,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the  United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and
financial highlights  (hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the
responsibility  of the Funds'  management;  our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of these financial  statements in accordance with auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  and evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe that our audit,  which  included  confirmation  of securities at May 31,
2003 by  correspondence  with the  custodian  and broker,  provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)


Subchapter M of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended,  required the
Funds to advise  shareholders within 60 days of the Funds' tax year end (May 31,
2003) as to the federal tax status of dividends  and  distributions  received by
shareholders during such tax year.  Accordingly,  please note that substantially
all  dividends  paid from net  investment  income from the Funds  during the tax
period ended May 31, 2003 were federally  exempt  interest  dividends.  However,
these Funds  invested in  municipal  bonds  containing  market  discount,  whose
accretion is taxable.  Accordingly,  the  percentage of dividends  paid from net
investment income during the tax year which are taxable were:

Municipal II                                8.20%
California Municipal II                     1.53%
New York Municipal II                       0.39%

Municipal II  distributed  $3,249,147  of long-term  capital  gains.  California
Municipal II and New York  Municipal  II did not  distribute  long-term  capital
gains.

Since the Funds' fiscal year is not the calendar year, another notification will
be sent with respect to calendar year 2003. In January 2004, you will be advised
on  IRS  Form  1099  DIV as to the  federal  tax  status  of the  dividends  and
distributions  received  during the calendar year 2003.  The amount that will be
reported,  will be the amount to use on your 2003 federal  income tax return and
may differ from the amount which must be reported in connection with each Fund's
tax year ended May 31, 2003.  Shareholders are advised to consult with their tax
advisors as to the  federal,  state and local tax status of the income  received
from the Funds.  In January  2004,  an  allocation  of interest by state will be
provided  which may be of value in reducing a  shareholder's  state or local tax
liability, if any.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (UNAUDITED)


Pursuant  to the Funds'  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan (the  "Plan"),  all Common
Shareholders  whose  shares  are  registered  in their own  names  will have all
dividends,  including any capital gain dividends,  reinvested  automatically  in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders (the
"Plan  Agent"),  unless the  shareholder  elects to receive cash. An election to
receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the  shareholder.  In
the case of record  shareholders  such as banks,  brokers or other nominees that
hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will
administer  the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares  certified from
time to  time  by the  record  shareholder  as  representing  the  total  amount
registered  in such  shareholder's  name and held for the account of  beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in
the name of a bank,  broker or nominee should contact the bank,  whose broker or
nominee elects not to participate  on the  investor's  behalf),  will be paid in
cash by check mailed, in the case of direct shareholder, to the record holder by
PFPC Inc., as the Funds' dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee)  elects not to  participate  in the Plan,
the number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1)    If Common  Shares are  trading at or above net asset value on the payment
       date, the Funds will issue new shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
       value per  Common  Share on the  payment  date or (ii) 95% of the  market
       price per Common Share on the payment date; or

(2)    If Common  Shares are  trading  below net asset  value  (minus  estimated
       brokerage  commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of Common
       Shares on the open  market)  on the  payment  date,  the Plan  Agent will
       receive the dividend or  distribution  in cash and will  purchase  Common
       Shares in the open market,  on the New York Stock  Exchange or elsewhere,
       for the participants'  accounts. It is possible that the market price for
       the Common  Shares may increase  before the Plan Agent has  completed its
       purchases.  Therefore,  the average  purchase price per share paid by the
       Plan Agent may exceed the market price on the payment date,  resulting in
       the  purchase of fewer shares than if the  dividend or  distribution  had
       been paid in Common Shares  issued by the Funds.  The Plan Agent will use
       all  dividends  and  distributions  received in cash to  purchase  Common
       Shares in the open market on or shortly after the payment date, but in no
       event later than the ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest
       will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw  from the Plan at any time by giving  notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is  terminated,  you will receive a certificate  for
each  whole  share in your  account  under the Plan and you will  receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan Agent
will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan  Agent  maintains  all  shareholders'  accounts  in the Plan and  gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts,  including information
you may need for tax  records.  The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common  Shares with  written  instructions  detailing  the  procedures  for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive  distributions in
cash.  Common  Shares  in  your  account  will  be held  by the  Plan  Agent  in
non-certificated  form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in  Common  Shares.  However,  all  participants  will pay a pro  rata  share of
brokerage  commissions  incurred  by the Plan Agent  when it makes  open  market
purchases.

Automatically  reinvested  dividends  and  distributions  are  taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Funds and the Plan Agent  reserve the right to amend or terminate  the Plan.
There is no direct  service charge to  participants  in the Plan;  however,  the
Funds reserve the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by
the  participants.  Additional  information  about the Plan may be obtained from
PFPC  Inc.,  400  Belleview  Parkway,  Wilmington,  DE 19809,  telephone  number
1-800-331-1710.

OTHER INFORMATION:

Since  June 28,  2002,  there has been no:  (i)  material  changes in the Funds'
investment  objectives  or  policies;  (ii)  changes  to the  Funds'  charter or
by-laws;  (iii) material  changes in the principal risk factors  associated with
investment in the Funds; or (iv) change in the person primarily  responsible for
the day-to-day management of each Fund's portfolio.
