MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC (the  "Company"  or "Fund")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited
         Liability  Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered  under
         the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  G.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series G is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series G can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Shares  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G are  sold to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series G from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or "the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         assets to various  Investment Funds.  Under  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         governing  documents,  the  Company  has  delegated  substantially  all
         authority to oversee the  management  of the  operations  and assets of
         Multi-Strategy Series G to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series G values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series G's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series G, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  G can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series G's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-Strategy  Series G does not factor into its valuation a
         liquidity  discount  on  any  Investment  Funds  held.  The  underlying
         investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as
         described  in  each  Investment   Fund's  financial   statements.   The
         Investment  Funds may  invest a portion of their  assets in  restricted
         securities and other investments that are illiquid.

     B.  FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance; registration expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board
         of Directors.  Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering
         were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of operations;
         costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy  Series G's subsequent
         registration  under the 1933 Act have been deferred and were  amortized
         over the twelve  months  commencing  after the  effective  date of such
         registration statement.

     C.  INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series  G  operated  as a  partnership  from  inception
         through  September  30,  2005.  As of October  1, 2005,  Multi-Strategy
         Series G  became  a  corporation  that  will be  taxed  as a  regulated
         investment company.

         It is Multi-Strategy  Series G's policy to meet the requirements of the
         Internal  Revenue Code  applicable  to regulated  investment  companies
         (RIC) and  distribute  substantially  all of its taxable

         net investment  income and capital gains, if any, to shareholders  each
         year. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is typically
         required for Multi-Strategy Series G's financial  statements.  However,
         during fiscal 2006,  the Fund  incurred  $14,590 of excise tax which is
         recognized as a component of Miscellaneous  expenses.  This expense was
         attributable to the conversion to RIC status.

         D. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A. account that earn money market rates and are accounted for at cost
         plus  accrued  interest.  On  September  30,  2006  the  Company  had a
         liability of  $7,186,126  in the  account.  This  negative  balance was
         subsequently cleared on November 2, 2006.

         E. USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing Multi-Strategy Series G's financial
         statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
         differ from these estimates.

     3.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

         In  July  2006,  the  Financial   Accounting   Standards  Board  issued
         Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an
         Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (the  "Interpretation").  The
         Interpretation  establishes  for all entities a minimum  threshold  for
         financial  statement  recognition of the benefit of positions  taken in
         filing  tax  returns  (including  whether  an  entity is  taxable  in a
         particular   jurisdiction),   and   requires   certain   expanded   tax
         disclosures. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning
         after  December 15, 2006, and is to be applied to all open tax years as
         of the date of effectiveness.  Management has evaluated the application
         of the  Interpretation  to the Fund, and does not anticipate its impact
         to have a material effect on the Fund's financial statements.

     4. MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series G. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee based on end of
         month  Members'  capital.  The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to
         its affiliates.

         Effective  August 1, 2005, the Board of Directors  approved a reduction
         in the  management  fee to  1.5% of net  assets  annually  (from  2.25%
         annually).

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  fees of  $15,311  to
         Multi-Strategy Series G during the six months ended September 30, 2006.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Fund Shares.  A placement agent will generally be entitled
         to receive a fee from each  investor  in the Company  whose  shares the
         agent  places.  The  specific  amount  of the  placement  fee paid with
         respect  to a  Member  is  generally  dependent  on  the  size  of  the
         investment in a Series.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent
         of the  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  shares.  For  the six  months  ended
         September  30,  2006,   CGM  earned   $496,650  in  placement  fees  on
         Multi-Strategy  Series  G  shares.  Such  fees  are  deducted  from  an
         investor's gross contribution amount.

         The Company has entered into  agreements  with third  parties to act as
         additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  shares.
         Placement fees may range from 0 to 3%. In addition, the Adviser, and/or
         its affiliates,  will pay the placement  agents an annual fee,  payable
         monthly  in  arrears.  The fee  shall be paid  from the  Adviser's  own
         resources (or those of its affiliates).

         Prior to October 1, 2005 Multi-Strategy Series G paid CAI a monthly fee
         of 0.025%  (0.30% on an  annualized  basis)  for  administration  based
         primarily  upon average net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,
         and reimbursed certain expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  retained PFPC
         Inc. ("PFPC"),  an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary
         of The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
         its  administrative  duties. On October 1, 2005 a restructuring of this
         arrangement  took affect.  Under the new  arrangement CAI and PFPC have
         separate  agreements with the Company and act as  co-administrators  to
         the Company. CAI, as co-administrator, no longer receives a monthly fee
         for their  administrative  services to the Company.  PFPC  continues to
         provide certain  accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services. Fees for their services are charged directly to the Company.

         Each  Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the  Company,  as
         defined by the 1940 Act,  receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus a
         fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $1,000. Such Director fees
         are allocated to each series pro-rata, based on the relative net assets
         of each series.  Any Director  who is an  "interested  person" does not
         receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  All  Directors  are
         reimbursed  for all reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total amounts
         expensed  related to Directors by  Multi-Strategy  Series G for the six
         months ended September 30, 2006 were $13,623.

         PFPC Trust  Company  (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as  custodian  of
         Multi-Strategy  Series G's assets and provides  custodial  services for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G.  Fees   payable   to  the   custodian   and
         reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series G.

     6.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  shares may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional subscriptions for shares in Multi-Strategy Series G. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  to
         repurchase  shares from Members  pursuant to written tenders by Members
         on such terms and conditions as it may  determine.  CAI expects that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to repurchase  shares from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series G for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

         Transactions  in  units  were  as  follows  for the  six  months  ended
         September 30, 2006 and the years ended March 31, 2006:

         In the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Investment  Funds  in which
         Multi-Strategy Series G invests trade various financial instruments and
         enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk.
         These  include,  but are not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,
         writing option contracts

         and entering into equity swaps.  Multi-Strategy Series G's risk of loss
         in these investment funds is limited to the value of it's investment in
         such funds.

     8.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

         In June  2006,  the Board of  Directors  approved  a Plan of Merger and
         Reorganization under which the Multi-Strategy  Series M will merge into
         the Multi-Strategy  Series G once the approval of the Members of Series
         M is obtained.  Members of Series M will exchange their Series M shares
         for an  equivalent  value  of  Series  G  shares  as of the date of the
         merger.  The proposed merger will be accounted for as if the respective
         funds had pooled their assets and liabilities.  Management expects that
         should the  Members of Series M approve  the merger  that it will occur
         during  the  fourth   quarter  of  2006.   As  of  September  30,  2006
         Multi-Strategy  Series  M had  Total  Assets  of  $63,391,178  and  Net
         Member's Capital of $61,234,710.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2006

     1.   ORGANIZATION

          Citigroup Alternative Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
          LLC (the  "Company"  or "Fund") was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited
          Liability  Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered under
          the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended,  as a
          closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company
          is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"). The
          Company consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
          Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The financial  statements
          included  herein  are for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M.  The  investment
          objective   of   Multi-Strategy   Series  M  is  to  achieve   capital
          appreciation   principally   through  investing  in  investment  funds
          ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by  third-party   investment  managers
          ("Investment   Managers")   that  employ  a  variety  of   alternative
          investment  strategies.  These investment  strategies allow Investment
          Managers the  flexibility  to use leverage or short-side  positions to
          take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies across the global markets,
          often  referred to as  "alternative"  strategies.  Because  Investment
          Funds following alternative  investment strategies are often described
          as hedge funds, the investment program of Multi-Strategy  Series M can
          be described as a fund of hedge funds.

          Shares  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M are sold to  eligible  investors
          (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial  investment  in
          Multi-Strategy  Series M from each Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
          from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the minimum  additional
          investment is $10,000.

          Citigroup  Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI",  or the "Adviser"),  a
          Delaware  limited  liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
          subsidiary  of Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
          investment adviser. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
          under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as amended,  and,  among
          other things,  is  responsible  for the  allocation of  Multi-Strategy
          Series M's assets to various  Investment Funds.  Under  Multi-Strategy
          Series  M's   governing   documents,   the   Company   has   delegated
          substantially   all  authority  to  oversee  the   management  of  the
          operations  and  assets  of  Multi-Strategy  Series M to the  Board of
          Directors.

     2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms of the
          respective limited partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
          agreements  and  offering  memoranda.  Multi-Strategy  Series M values
          these  investments  at fair value based on financial  data supplied by
          the Investment Funds.

          A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

          The net asset value of Multi-Strategy Series M is determined as of the
          close of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
          valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
          to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


          Multi-Strategy  Series M's investments in Investment Funds are carried
          at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series M's  pro-rata
          interest in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
          utilize financial information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
          net of management and performance  incentive fees or other allocations
          payable  to  the  Investment   Funds'  managers  as  required  by  the
          Investment  Funds'  agreements.  Each Investment  Manager to which the
          Adviser  allocates  assets  will  charge  Multi-Strategy  Series M, as
          investor in an underlying  Investment  Fund, an  asset-based  fee, and
          some or all of the Investment Managers will receive  performance-based
          compensation in the form of an incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of
          the Investment  Managers are generally expected to range from 1% to 3%
          annually of the net assets under their  management  and the  incentive
          fee is  generally  expected  to range  from 15% to 25% of net  profits
          annually.

          As a general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's
          investment  in  an  Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
          Multi-Strategy  Series M can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
          Investment Fund if Multi-Strategy  Series M's investment were redeemed
          at the time of valuation,  based on information available at the time.
          The  Investment  Funds provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
          monthly to annually. Investment Funds generally require advance notice
          of a Member's intent to redeem its interest, and may, depending on the
          Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a redemption
          request.  Multi-Strategy Series M does not factor into its valuation a
          liquidity  discount  on any  Investment  Funds  held.  The  underlying
          investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as
          described  in  each  Investment  Fund's  financial   statements.   The
          Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their  assets in  restricted
          securities and other investments that are illiquid.

          B.   FUND EXPENSES

          Multi-Strategy  Series M bears all expenses  incurred in the course of
          its  operations,  including,  but not limited to, the  following:  all
          costs and expenses related to portfolio transactions and positions for
          Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
          insurance;  registration  expenses;  and  expenses  of meetings of the
          Board of  Directors.  Costs  incurred in  connection  with the initial
          offering were  deferred and amortized  over the first twelve months of
          operations;  costs incurred in connection with  Multi-Strategy  Series
          M's subsequent  registration under the 1933 Act have been deferred and
          were amortized over the twelve months  commencing  after the effective
          date of such registration statement.

          C.   INCOME TAXES

          Multi-Strategy  Series M  operated  as a  partnership  from  inception
          through  September  30,  2005.  As of October 1, 2005,  Multi-Strategy
          Series M  became  a  corporation  that  will be  taxed as a  regulated
          investment company.

          It is Multi-Strategy Series M's policy to meet the requirements of the
          Internal  Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies
          (RIC) and distribute  substantially  all of its taxable net investment
          income  and  capital  gains,  if  any,  to  shareholders   each  year.
          Therefore,  no federal  income or excise tax  provision  is  typically
          required for Multi-Strategy Series M's financial statements.  However,
          during fiscal 2006,  the Fund  incurred  $1,714 of excise tax which is
          recognized as a component of Miscellaneous  expenses. This expense was
          attributable to the conversion to RIC status.

          D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank,
          N.A.  account that earn money market  rates and are  accounted  for at
          cost plus accrued interest.

          E.   USE OF ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.
          generally accepted accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
          estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  amounts  reported in the
          financial statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
          the  estimates  utilized  in  preparing   Multi-Strategy   Series  M's
          financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual
          results could differ from these estimates.

     3.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

          In  July  2006,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
          Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -
          an Interpretation  of FASB Statement No. 109" (the  "Interpretation").
          The  Interpretation  establishes for all entities a minimum  threshold
          for financial statement  recognition of the benefit of positions taken
          in filing  tax  returns  (including  whether an entity is taxable in a
          particular   jurisdiction),   and   requires   certain   expanded  tax
          disclosures.   The   Interpretation  is  effective  for  fiscal  years
          beginning  after  December 15, 2006,  and is to be applied to all open
          tax years as of the date of  effectiveness.  Management  has evaluated
          the  application  of the  Interpretation  to the  Fund,  and  does not
          anticipate  its  impact  to  have a  material  effect  on  the  Fund's
          financial statements.

     4.   MANAGEMENT FEE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  FEE,  RELATED PARTY  TRANSACTIONS AND
          OTHER

          CAI,  as  Adviser,  provides  certain  management  and  administrative
          services to  Multi-Strategy  Series M. CAI acts  primarily to evaluate
          and select Investment  Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and
          apply risk management  procedures,  and to monitor overall  investment
          performance.  In addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
          support services.  In consideration for such services,  Multi-Strategy
          Series M will pay the Adviser a monthly management fee based on end of
          month Members'  capital.  The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to
          its affiliates.

          Effective August 1, 2005, the Board of Directors  approved a reduction
          in the  management  fee to 1.5% of net  assets  annually  (from  2.00%
          annually).

          In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  fees of  $5,267  to
          Multi-Strategy  Series M during the six  months  ended  September  30,
          2006.

          Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to assist in the
          placement of Fund shares. A placement agent will generally be entitled
          to receive a fee from each  investor in the Company  whose  shares the
          agent  places.  The  specific  amount of the  placement  fee paid with
          respect  to a  Member  is  generally  dependent  on  the  size  of the
          investment in a Series.

          Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
          wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. serves as a placement agent
          of the  Multi-Strategy  Series  M  shares.  For the six  months  ended
          September 30, 2006, CGM earned $0 in placement fees on  Multi-Strategy
          Series M  shares.  Such fees are  deducted  from an  investor's  gross
          contribution amount.

          The Company has entered into  agreements  with third parties to act as
          additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M  shares.
          Placement  fees may range  from 0 to 3%.  In  addition,  the  Adviser,
          and/or its  affiliates,  will pay the placement  agents an annual fee,
          payable  monthly in arrears.  The fee shall be paid from the Adviser's
          own resources (or those of its affiliates).

          Prior to  October 1, 2005  Multi-Strategy  Series M paid CAI a monthly
          fee of 0.025% (0.30% on an annualized basis) for administration  based
          primarily upon average net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,
          and reimbursed certain expenses. CAI, as Administrator,  retained PFPC
          Inc. ("PFPC"), an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary
          of The PNC Financial  Services  Group, to assist in the performance of
          its administrative  duties. On October 1, 2005 a restructuring of this
          arrangement  took affect.  Under the new arrangement CAI and PFPC have
          separate agreements with the Company and act as  co-administrators  to
          the Company.  CAI, as  co-administrator,  no longer receives a monthly
          fee for their administrative  services to the Company.  PFPC continues
          to  provide  certain  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax and  investor
          related services.  Fees for their services are charged directly to the
          Company.

          Each  Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Company,  as
          defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus a
          fee per meeting of the Board of  Directors  of $1,000.  Such  Director
          fees are allocated to each series pro-rata,  based on the relative net
          assets of each series. Any Director who is an "interested person" does
          not receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  All  Directors
          are  reimbursed  for all  reasonable  out of  pocket  expenses.  Total
          amounts expensed related to Directors by  Multi-Strategy  Series M for
          the six months ended September 30, 2006 were $4,169.

          PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as  custodian  of
          Multi-Strategy  Series M's assets and provides  custodial services for
          Multi-Strategy   Series  M.  Fees   payable  to  the   custodian   and
          reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by  Multi-Strategy  Series
          M.

     6.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

          Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for shares may be
          accepted as of the first day of each month. CAI has been authorized by
          the Board of  Directors of the Company to accept or reject any initial
          and additional  subscriptions for shares in  Multi-Strategy  Series M.
          The  Board of  Directors  from  time to time and in its  complete  and
          exclusive discretion may determine to cause Multi-Strategy Series M to
          repurchase  shares from Members pursuant to written tenders by Members
          on such terms and conditions as it may determine.  CAI expects that it
          typically  will  recommend to the Board of Directors  that the Company
          offer to repurchase shares from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
          June 30,  September  30 and December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
          business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

          Net  profits  or  net  losses  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M for  each
          month-end will be allocated  among and credited to or debited  against
          the  capital  accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month
          in accordance with the Members' respective investment  percentages for
          the month.

          Transactions  in  units  were as  follows  for the  six  months  ended
          September 30, 2006 and the years ended March 31, 2006:

          In the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Investment  Funds in which
          Multi-Strategy  Series M invests trade various  financial  instruments
          and enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance  sheet

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     8.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

          In June  2006,  the Board of  Directors  approved a Plan of Merger and
          Reorganization under which the Multi-Strategy Series M will merge into
          the Multi-Strategy Series G once the approval of the Members of Series
          M is obtained. Members of Series M will exchange their Series M shares
          for an  equivalent  value of  Series  G  shares  as of the date of the
          merger. The proposed merger will be accounted for as if the respective
          funds had pooled their assets and liabilities. Management expects that
          should the  Members of Series M approve  the merger that it will occur
          during  the  fourth   quarter  of  2006.  As  of  September  30,  2006
          Multi-Strategy  Series G had  Total  Assets  of  $232,367,226  and Net
          Member's Capital of $226,408,450.
