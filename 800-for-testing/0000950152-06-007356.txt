                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)  ORGANIZATION

     The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), is a limited partnership
organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Fund was registered and
began operations on March 10, 2004 ("Inception") as a nondiversified, closed-end
management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund was created to serve as a feeder fund for The Endowment
Master Fund, L.P. (the "Master Fund"). For convenience, reference to the Fund
may include the Master Fund, as the context requires.

     The Fund's investment objective is to preserve capital and to generate
consistent long-term appreciation and returns across all market cycles. The Fund
pursues its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in
the Master Fund, which invests its assets in a variety of investment vehicles
including but not limited to limited partnerships and limited liability
companies (collectively, the "Investment Funds"), registered investment
companies and direct investments in marketable securities and derivative
instruments. The Master Fund is a "fund of funds" and is intended to afford
investors the ability to invest in a multi-manager portfolio, exhibiting a
variety of investment styles and philosophies, in an attempt to achieve positive
risk-adjusted returns over an extended period of time. The Fund's investments
are managed by a select group of investment managers identified by the Adviser,
as hereinafter defined, to have investments that when grouped with other
investments of the Fund result in a portfolio that is allocated broadly across
markets, asset classes, and risk profiles. The Master Fund's financial
statements, footnotes and schedule of investments, included elsewhere in this
report, are an integral part of the Fund's financial statements that should be
read in conjunction with this report. The percentage of the Master Fund's
partnership interests owned by the Fund on June 30, 2006 was 19.52%.

     The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, serves as the
general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner"). To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the General Partner has irrevocably delegated to a
board of directors (the "Board" and each member a "Director") its rights and
powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Fund, including the
complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the
management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business. A majority of the
members of the Board are independent of the General Partner and its management.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any of its
rights, powers and authority to, among others, the officers of the Fund, the
Adviser, or any committee of the Board.

     The Board is authorized to engage an investment adviser and it has selected
Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the "Adviser"), to manage the Fund's portfolio and
operations, pursuant to an investment management agreement (the "Investment
Management Agreement"). The Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership that is
registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(the "Advisers Act"). Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is
responsible for the establishment of an investment committee (the "Investment
Committee"), which is responsible for developing, implementing, and supervising
the Fund's investment program subject to the ultimate supervision of the Board.
In addition to investment advisory services, the Adviser also functions as the
servicing agent of the Fund (the "Servicing Agent") and as such provides or
procures investor services and administrative assistance for the Fund. The
Adviser can delegate all or a portion of its duties as Servicing Agent to other
parties, who would in turn act as sub-servicing agents.

(2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

  (A)  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

     The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the accrual
basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)

  (B)  CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Fund considers all unpledged temporary cash investments with a maturity
date at the time of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

  (C)  INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.

     Securities that are held by the Fund, including those that have been sold
but not yet purchased, are marked to estimated fair value at the date of the
financial statements, and the corresponding unrealized gain or loss is included
in the statement of operations.

     Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are accounted
for based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.

     Distributions received from investments, whether in the form of cash or
securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

  (D)  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

     The valuation of the Fund's investments will be determined as of the close
of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly. The valuation of
the Fund's investments is generally calculated by BISYS Fund Services Ohio, Inc.
("BISYS"), the Fund's independent administrator (the "Independent
Administrator") in consultation with the Adviser. The valuation procedures of
the Fund's underlying investments are reviewed by a committee approved by the
Board that was established to oversee the valuation of the Fund's investments
(the "Valuation Committee"), in consultation with the Adviser and the
Independent Administrator. The net assets of the Fund will equal the value of
the total assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued
fees and expenses.

     The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund.
Investments in the Master Fund are accounted for using the equity method, which
approximates fair value. Valuation of the investments held by the Master Fund is
discussed in the notes to the Master Fund financial statements included
elsewhere in this report.

  (E)  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is
recorded as earned on the accrual basis.

  (F)  FUND EXPENSES

     Unless voluntarily or contractually assumed by the Adviser or another
party, the Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, directly or
indirectly through its investment in the Master Fund, including but not limited
to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment transactions and
positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting, auditing and tax
preparation fees; recordkeeping and custodial fees; costs of computing the
Fund's net asset value; fees for data and software providers; research expenses;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; certain offering costs; expenses of
meetings of the partners; directors fees; all costs with respect to
communications

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)

to partners; and other types of expenses as may be approved from time to time by
the Board. Offering costs are amortized over a twelve month period or less from
the date they are incurred.

  (G)  INCOME TAXES

     The Fund itself is not subject to federal, state, or local income taxes
because such taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners in the
Fund. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made in the Fund's
financial statements.

  (H)  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  (I)  ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

     The Fund's organizational expenses (the "Organizational Expenses") were
initially borne by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof and for capital account
allocation purposes assumed to be reimbursed, over not more than a 60 month
period of time, notwithstanding that such Organizational Expenses were expensed
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for Fund
reporting purposes upon commencement of operations.

(3)  PARTNERS' CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

  (A)  ISSUANCE OF INTERESTS

     Upon receipt from an eligible investor of an application for interests (the
"Interests"), which will generally be accepted as of the first day of each
month, the Fund will issue new Interests. The Interests have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the
securities laws of any state. The Fund issues Interests only in private
placement transactions in accordance with Regulation D or other applicable
exemptions under the Securities Act. No public market exists for the Interests,
and none is expected to develop. The Fund is not required, and does not intend,
to hold annual meetings of its partners. The Interests are subject to
substantial restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
transferred or resold except as permitted under the Fund's limited partnership
agreement (the "LP Agreement").

     The Fund reserves the right to reject any applications for Interests. The
$13,993,966 in subscriptions received in advance as of June 30, 2006 represents
subscriptions for Fund Interests received prior to the July 2006 closing.

  (B)  ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

     For each fiscal period, generally monthly, net profits or net losses of the
Fund, including allocations from the Master Fund, are allocated among and
credited to or debited against the capital accounts of all partners as of the
last day of each fiscal period in accordance with the partners' respective
investment ownership percentages for the fiscal period. Net profits or net
losses are measured as the net change in the value of the net assets of the
Fund, including any net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of
investments and income, net of expenses, and realized gains or losses during a
fiscal period. Net profits or net losses are allocated after giving effect for
any repurchases of Interests or initial or additional applications for
Interests, which generally occur at the beginning of the month.

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)

  (C)  REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS

     A partner will not be eligible to have the Fund repurchase all or any
portion of an Interest at any time prior to the business day immediately
preceding the one-year anniversary of the partner's purchase of such Interest
(or portion thereof) without incurring additional costs including an early
repurchase fee. The Adviser, which also serves as the investment adviser of the
Master Fund, expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to
repurchase such Interests each calendar quarter, pursuant to written tenders by
partners. However, the Board retains the sole discretion to accept or reject the
recommendation of the Adviser and to determine the amount of Interests, if any,
that will be purchased in any tender offer that it does approve. Since the
Fund's assets are invested in the Master Fund, the ability of the Fund to redeem
its Interests in the Master Fund would be subject to the Master Fund's
repurchase policy. In addition, the Fund may determine not to conduct a
repurchase offer each time the Master Fund conducts a repurchase offer. In the
event Interests are redeemed, there will be a substantial period of time between
the date as of which partners must tender their Interests for repurchase and the
date they can expect to receive payment for their Interests from the Fund.

(4)  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

     As of June 30, 2006, all of the investments made by the Fund were in the
Master Fund.

(5)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
may invest either directly or through the Master Fund will trade various
derivative securities and other financial instruments, and enter into various
investment activities with off-balance sheet risk both as an investor and as a
principal. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the
Fund's pro-rata share of the value of the investment in such Investment Funds as
held by the Master Fund. In addition, the Master Fund may from time to time
invest directly in derivative securities or other financial instruments to gain
greater or lesser exposure to a particular asset class.

(6)  ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

     In consideration for administrative, accounting, and recordkeeping
services, the Master Fund will pay the Independent Administrator a monthly
administration fee (the "Administration Fee") based on the month end net assets
of the Master Fund. The Master Fund is charged, on an annual basis, 8 basis
points on Master Fund net assets of up to $100 million, 7 basis points on Master
Fund net assets between the amounts of $100 million and $250 million and 6 basis
points for amounts over $250 million. The asset based fees are assessed based on
month end net assets and are payable monthly in arrears. The Independent
Administrator will also provide the Master Fund with legal, compliance, transfer
agency, and other investor related services at an additional cost.

     The fees for Fund administration will be paid out of the Master Fund's
assets, which will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the
partners in the Fund.

(7)  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  (A)  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE

     In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Adviser
to the Master Fund, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Master
Fund will pay the Adviser an investment management fee (the "Investment
Management Fee"), equal to 1% on an annualized basis of the Master Fund's net
assets, calculated based on the NAV at the end of each month, payable quarterly
in arrears. So long as the Fund invests all of its investable assets in the
Master Fund, the Fund will not pay the Adviser directly any Investment
Management Fee;


                                        8

<PAGE>

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)

however, the Fund's partners bear an indirect portion of the Investment
Management Fee paid by the Master Fund. The Investment Management Fee will
decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund and
indirectly the Fund as the fees reduce the capital accounts of the Master Fund's
limited partners.

  (B)  SERVICING FEE

     In consideration for providing or procuring investor services and
administrative assistance to the Fund, the Adviser will receive a servicing fee
(the "Servicing Fee") equal to 1% (on an annualized basis) of each partner's
capital account balance, calculated at the end of each month, payable quarterly
in arrears.

     The Adviser chose to waive the Servicing Fee since Inception of the Fund
until such time as the collective net asset value of all 1940 Act feeders
investing in the Master Fund exceeded $40 million and the initial offering costs
of the Fund had been fully amortized. As of June 30, 2005 the Fund's net asset
value exceeded $40 million and all offering costs had been amortized. Therefore,
beginning July 1, 2005 the Fund eliminated the Servicing Fee waiver. For the six
months ended June 30, 2006, $369,178 in Servicing Fees were charged by the
Adviser.

  (C)  PLACEMENT AGENTS

     The Fund may engage one or more placement agents (each, a "Placement
Agent") to solicit investments in the Fund. Sanders Morris Harris, Inc. ("SMH"),
an affiliate of the General Partner and the Adviser, has been engaged to serve
as a Placement Agent. SMH is a full service investment banking, broker-dealer,
asset management and financial services organization. A Placement Agent may
engage one or more sub-placement agents. The Adviser or its affiliates may pay a
fee out of their own resources to Placement Agents and sub-placement agents.

(8)  INDEBTEDNESS OF THE FUND

     Pursuant to the Fund LP Agreement, the Fund may borrow up to, but not more
than, 10% of the net assets of the Fund (at the time such borrowings were made
and after taking into account the investment and/or deployment of such proceeds)
for the purpose of making investments, funding redemptions and for other working
capital and general Fund purposes. For purposes of the Fund's investment
restrictions and certain investment limitations under the 1940 Act, including
for example, the Fund's leverage limitations, the Fund will not "look through"
Investment Funds in which the Fund invests. Investment Funds may also use
leverage, whether through borrowings, futures, or other derivative products and
are not subject to the Fund's investment restrictions. However, such borrowings
by Investment Funds are without recourse to the Fund and the Fund's risk of loss
is limited to its pro rata share of such Investment Funds (held through its
investment in the Master Fund) , other than for some Investment Funds in which
the Master Fund has made a capital commitment. For some Investment Funds in
which the Master Fund has made a capital commitment that will be funded over a
period of time, such as private equity and real estate funds, the Master Fund,
in certain instances, may commit to fund up to twice its initial capital
commitment. The rights of any lenders to the Fund to receive payments of
interest or repayments of principal will be senior to those of the partners, and
the terms of any borrowings may contain provisions that limit certain activities
of the Fund.

     * The above calculations reflect the waiver of the Servicing Fees since
Inception of the Fund through June 30, 2005. An investor's return (and operating
ratios) may vary from those reflected based on the timing of capital
transactions.

- --------

  (1) Ratios are calculated by dividing by average partners' capital measured at
      the end of the each month during the period. Ratios include allocations of
      net investment loss and expenses from the Master Fund. The 2006 and 2004
      ratios have been annualized.

  (2) Had the Servicing Fee waiver not been in effect, the annualized ratios for
      net investment loss to average partners' capital would have been (1.73%)
      and (4.42%) for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Without the Servicing Fee
      waiver, the annualized ratios for expenses to average partners' capital
      would have been 2.59% and 5.14% for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

  (3) The Fund is invested exclusively in the Master Fund, therefore this ratio
      reflects the portfolio turnover of the Master Fund.

  (4) Calculated as geometrically linked monthly returns for each month in the
      period.

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     The Fund's operations are managed under the direction and oversight of the
Board. Each Director serves for an indefinite term or until he or she reaches
mandatory retirement, if any, as established by the Board. The Board appoints
the officers of the Fund who are responsible for the Fund's day-to-day business
decisions based on policies set by the Board. The officers serve at the pleasure
of the Board.

COMPENSATION FOR DIRECTORS

     The Fund, the Registered Fund and the TEI Fund together currently pay each
Independent Director an annual fee of $10,000, which is paid quarterly, a fee of
$2,500 per Board meeting, and a $500 fee per meeting for each member on the

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

     At a meeting of the Board held on January 18, 2006, the Board considered
and approved the Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and the
Adviser. In reviewing this agreement, the Board requested information, which was
provided by the Adviser, that was reasonably necessary for the Board to evaluate
the agreement, and was advised by counsel. Following its review, the Board
concluded that the Investment Management Agreement enables the Fund's partners
to obtain high quality services at a cost that is appropriate, reasonable, and
in the best interests of investors based upon the following determinations,
among others:

     The nature, extent and quality of the advisory service to be
provided.  Based on the nature and quality of the services provided by the
Adviser to the Fund in the past (as well as services anticipated to be provided
in the future), the Adviser's management capabilities demonstrated with respect
to the Master Fund, the Adviser's management oversight process, and the
professional qualifications and experience of the Adviser's investment
committee, the Board concluded that the Adviser is capable of providing high
quality services to the Fund. The Board also concluded that the Adviser would
provide the same quality and quantity of investment management and related
services as provided in the past, that these services are appropriate in scope
and extent in light of the Fund's operations, the competitive landscape of the
investment company business and investor needs and that the Adviser's advisory
obligations will remain the same in all respects.

     The investment performance of the Fund.  The Board concluded, based on
comparative performance information compiled by the Adviser, that the Fund's
investment performance was superior to the performance of its comparative
benchmark index and competitive or superior relative to comparable funds . On
the basis of the Directors' assessment of the nature, extent and quality of
investment advisory and related services to be provided or procured by the
Adviser, the Directors concluded that the Adviser was capable of generating a
level of long-term investment performance that is appropriate in light of the
Fund's investment objective, policies and strategies and competitive with many
other comparable funds.

     The cost of advisory service provided and the level of profitability.  On
the basis of the Board's review of the fees to be charged by the Adviser for
investment advisory, investor servicing and related services, the unique nature
of the Fund's investment program, the Adviser's financial information, the fees
paid by the Adviser to the Master Fund's sub-adviser, the costs associated with
managing the Fund and the estimated profitability of the Adviser's relationships
with the Fund, the Board concluded that the level of investment management fees,
investor servicing fees and the profitability is appropriate in light of the
services provided, the management fees and overall expense ratios of comparable
investment companies, and the anticipated profitability of the relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser. Further, on the basis of comparative
information supplied by the Adviser, the Board determined that the management
fees and estimated overall expense ratio of the Fund were competitive with
comparable investment companies.

     The extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows
and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of Fund
investors.  While noting that the management fees will not decrease as the level
of Fund assets increases, the Board concluded that the management fees
appropriately reflect the Fund's

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)

current size, the current economic environment for the Adviser, and the
competitive nature of the investment company market as relevant to the Fund. In
addition, the Board noted that it will have the opportunity to periodically re-
examine whether the Fund has achieved economies of scale, as well as the
appropriateness of management fees payable to the Adviser, in the future.

     Benefits (such as soft dollars) to the Adviser from its relationship with
the Fund.  The Board concluded that other benefits derived by the Adviser from
its relationship with the Fund are reasonable and fair, result from the
provision of appropriate services to the Fund and investors therein, and are
consistent with industry practice and the best interests of the Fund and its
partners. In this regard, the Board noted that the Adviser does not realize
"soft dollar" benefits from its relationship with the Fund.

     Other considerations.  The Board also determined that the Adviser has made
a substantial commitment to the recruitment and retention of high quality
personnel, and maintained the financial, compliance and operational resources
reasonably necessary to manage the Fund in a professional manner that is
consistent with the best interests of the Fund and its partners. The Directors
also concluded that the Adviser has made a significant entrepreneurial
commitment to the management and success of the Fund, reflected by various fee
waivers and expense limitation measures taken with respect to the Fund which may
result in the Adviser waiving a substantial amount of fees or otherwise limiting
Fund expenses for the benefit of the Fund's partners.

                         THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  JUNE 30, 2006
                                   (UNAUDITED)

(1)  ORGANIZATION

     The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a limited partnership
organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Fund began operations in
April 2003 ("Inception"). The Fund operated as an unregistered investment
vehicle until March 10, 2004, at which time it registered as a nondiversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Fund is the master fund in a master-feeder structure
in which there are currently six feeder funds.

     The Fund's investment objective is to preserve capital and to generate
consistent long-term appreciation and returns across all market cycles. The Fund
pursues its investment objective by investing its assets in a variety of
investment vehicles including but not limited to limited partnerships and
limited liability companies (collectively, the "Investment Funds"), registered
investment companies and direct investments in marketable securities and
derivative instruments. The Fund is a "fund of funds" and is intended to afford
investors the ability to invest in a multi-manager portfolio, exhibiting a
variety of investment styles and philosophies, in an attempt to achieve positive
risk-adjusted returns over an extended period of time. The Fund's investments
are managed by a select group of investment managers identified by the Adviser,
as hereinafter defined, to have investments that when grouped with other
investments of the Fund result in a portfolio that is allocated broadly across
markets, asset classes, and risk profiles.

     The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, serves as the
general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner"). To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the General Partner has irrevocably delegated to a
board of directors (the "Board" and each member a "Director") its rights and
powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Fund, including the
complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the
management, conduct, and operation of the Fund's business. A majority of the
members of the Board are independent of the General Partner and its management.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any of its
rights, powers and authority to, among others, the officers of the Fund, the
Adviser, or any committee of the Board.

     The Board is authorized to engage an investment adviser and it has selected
Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the "Adviser"), to manage the Fund's portfolio and
operations, pursuant to an investment management agreement (the "Investment
Management Agreement"). The Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership that is
registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(the "Advisers Act"). Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is
responsible for the establishment of an investment committee (the "Investment
Committee"), which is responsible for developing, implementing, and supervising
the Fund's investment program subject to the ultimate supervision of the Board.

(2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

  (a)  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

     The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the accrual
basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

  (b)  CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Fund considers all unpledged temporary cash investments with a maturity
date at the time of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

                         THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)


  (c)  INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.

     Securities that are held by the Fund, including those that have been sold
but not yet purchased, are marked to estimated fair value at the date of the
financial statements, and the corresponding unrealized gain or loss is included
in the statement of operations.

     Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are accounted
for based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.

     Distributions received from Investment Funds, whether in the form of cash
or securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

  (d)  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

     The valuation of the Fund's investments will be determined as of the close
of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly. The valuation of
the Fund's investments is generally calculated by BISYS Fund Services Ohio, Inc.
("BISYS"), the Fund's independent administrator (the "Independent
Administrator") in consultation with the Adviser. The valuation procedures of
the Fund's underlying investments are reviewed by a committee approved by the
Board that was established to oversee the valuation of the Fund's investments
(the "Valuation Committee"), in consultation with the Adviser and the
Independent Administrator. The net assets of the Fund will equal the value of
the total assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued
fees and expenses.

     Investments held by the Fund are valued as follows:

     - INVESTMENT FUNDS -- Investments in Investment Funds are ordinarily valued
       at the valuations provided to the Independent Administrator by the
       investment managers of such Investment Funds or the administrators of
       those Investment Funds. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
       subject to the terms and conditions of the respective operating
       agreements and offering memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments
       in Investment Funds are carried at estimated fair value as determined by
       the Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund.
       Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, this estimated fair
       value may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready
       market for the investments in Investment Funds existed. These Investment
       Funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies
       established by such Investment Funds. All valuations utilize financial
       information supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management
       and estimated performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
       Investment Funds' managers pursuant to the Investment Funds' agreements.

     - SECURITIES LISTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE -- In general, the Fund values
       listed securities at their last sales price as of the last business day
       of the applicable period. If no sale occurred on that date, the
       securities are valued at the mean between the "bid" and "asked" prices at
       the close of trading on that date.

     - SECURITIES LISTED ON OVER-THE-COUNTER EXCHANGES -- Securities listed on
       over-the counter exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on
       the date of determination, if available, through the facilities of a
       recognized interdealer quotation system (such as securities in the NASDAQ
       National Market List) or at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. If the
       last reported sales price is not available, the securities are valued at
       the mean between the "bid" and "asked" prices at the close of trading on
       that date.

     - OPTIONS -- Options that are listed on a securities exchange or traded
       over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the closing "bid" and
       "asked" prices for such options on the date of determination.

                         THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                             (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)


     - SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED -- The value of securities, derivatives or
       synthetic securities that are not actively traded on an exchange shall be
       determined by obtaining indicative quotes from brokers that normally deal
       in such securities or by an unaffiliated pricing service that may use
       actual trade data or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield
       curves, specific trading characteristics of certain groups of securities,
       pricing models or a combination of these procedures.

     - OTHER -- Where no value is readily available from an Investment Fund or
       other security or where a value supplied by an Investment Fund is deemed
       not to be indicative of the Investment Fund's value, the Valuation
       Committee and/or the Board, in consultation with the Independent
       Administrator or the Adviser will determine, in good faith, the estimated
       fair value of the Investment Fund or security.

  (e)  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is
recorded as earned on the accrual basis.

  (f)  FUND EXPENSES

     Unless voluntarily or contractually assumed by the Adviser or another
party, the Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not
limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment
transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting,
auditing and tax preparation fees; recordkeeping and custodial fees; costs of
computing the Fund's net asset value; fees for data and software providers;
research expenses; costs of insurance; registration expenses; certain offering
costs; expenses of meetings of the partners; directors fees; all costs with
respect to communications to partners; transfer taxes and taxes withheld on non-
US dividends; interest and commitment fees on loans and debit balances; and
other types of expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.
Offering costs are amortized over a twelve-month period or less from the date
they are incurred.

  (g)  INCOME TAXES

     The Fund itself is not subject to federal, state, or local income taxes
because such taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners in the
Fund. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made in the Fund's
financial statements other than withholding tax on dividend income that is
allocated to the Fund's offshore feeders.

  (h)  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  (i)  ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

     The Fund's organizational expenses (the "Organizational Expenses") were
initially borne by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof and for capital account
allocation purposes assumed to be reimbursed, over not more than a 60 month
period of time, notwithstanding that such Organizational Expenses were expensed
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for Fund
reporting purposes upon commencement of operations.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                   (UNAUDITED)


(3)  PARTNERS' CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

  (a)  ISSUANCE OF INTERESTS

     Upon receipt from an eligible investor of an application for interests (the
"Interests"), which will generally be accepted as of the first day of each
month, the Fund will issue new Interests. The Interests have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the
securities laws of any state. The Fund issues Interests only in private
placement transactions in accordance with Regulation D or other applicable
exemptions under the Securities Act. No public market exists for the Interests,
and none is expected to develop. The Fund is not required, and does not intend,
to hold annual meetings of its partners. The Interests are subject to
substantial restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
transferred or resold except as permitted under the Fund's limited partnership
agreement (the "LP Agreement"). The Fund reserves the right to reject any
applications for subscription of Interests.

  (b)  ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

     For each fiscal period, generally monthly, net profits or net losses of the
Fund are allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
of all partners as of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with the
partners' respective investment ownership percentages for the fiscal period. Net
profits or net losses are measured as the net change in the value of the net
assets of the Fund, including any net change in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation of investments and income, net of expenses, and realized gains or
losses during a fiscal period. Net profits or net losses are allocated after
giving effect for any repurchases of Interests or initial or additional
applications for Interests, which generally occur at the beginning of the month.

  (c)  REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS

     A partner will not be eligible to have the Fund repurchase all or any
portion of an Interest at the partner's discretion at any time. However, the
Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to
repurchase Interests each calendar quarter, pursuant to written tenders by
partners. The Board retains the sole discretion to accept or reject the
recommendation of the Adviser and to determine the amount, if any, that will be
purchased in any tender offer that it does approve. In the event Interests are
repurchased, there will be a substantial period of time between the date as of
which partners must accept the Fund's offer to repurchase their Interests and
the date they can expect to receive payment for their Interests from the Fund.

(4)  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

     As of June 30, 2006, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds,
registered investment companies and marketable securities in a separately
managed account, which is managed by a sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser"). The
$22,651,885 in prepaid contribution to Investment Funds as of June 30, 2006
represents funding of a portion of the July 2006 investment in such funds. The
agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation
to the Investment Funds' managers/general partners or advisors in the form of
management fees ranging from 0.25% to 2.5% of net assets annually. In addition,
many Investment Funds also provide for performance incentive fees/allocations
ranging up to 20% of an Investment Fund's net profits, although it is possible
that such ranges may be exceeded for certain investment managers. These fees and
incentive fees are in addition to the management fees charged by the Fund.

     In general, most of the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests, other
than Investment Funds investing primarily in private equity, energy and real
estate transactions, provide for periodic redemptions ranging from

monthly to annually with lock up provisions usually for a period of up to four
years. Investment Funds that do provide for periodic redemptions may, depending
on the Investment Fund's governing documents, have the ability to deny or delay
a redemption request. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the aggregate cost
of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments were $126,356,492 and
$58,354,029 respectively.

     The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from its investments. The
allocated taxable income is generally reported to the Fund by its underlying
investments on Schedules K-1 or 1099's. As of June 30, 2006, the cost of the
Fund's investments was $384,289,786. Accordingly, unrealized appreciation and
depreciation on investments was $79,972,267 and $3,180,374 respectively.

(5)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
invests trade various derivative securities and other financial instruments, and
enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk both as an
investor and as a principal. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds
is limited to the value of the investment in such Investment Funds as reported
by the Fund. In addition, the Fund may from time to time invest directly in
derivative securities or other financial instruments to gain greater or lesser
exposure to a particular asset class.

(6)  DUE FROM BROKERS

     The Fund conducts business with various brokers for its investment
activities. The clearing and depository operations for the investment activities
are performed pursuant to agreements with the brokers. The Fund is subject to
credit risk to the extent any broker with whom the Fund conducts business is
unable to deliver cash balances or securities, or clear security transactions on
the Fund's behalf. The Fund monitors the financial condition of the brokers with
which the Fund conducts business and believes the likelihood of loss under the
aforementioned circumstances is remote.

(7)  ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

     In consideration for administrative, accounting, and recordkeeping
services, the Fund will pay the Independent Administrator a monthly
administration fee (the "Administration Fee") based on the month end net assets
of the Fund. The Fund is charged, on an annual basis, 8 basis points on Fund net
assets of up to $100 million, 7 basis points on Fund net assets between the
amounts of $100 million and $250 million and 6 basis points for amounts over
$250 million. The asset based fees are assessed based on month end net assets
and are payable monthly in arrears. The Independent Administrator will also
provide the Fund with legal, compliance, transfer agency, and other investor
related services at an additional cost.

     The fees for Fund administration will be paid out of the Fund's assets,
which will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the partners
in the Fund. As of June 30, 2006, the Fund had $461,328,700 in net assets. The
total Administration Fee incurred for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was
$141,428.

(8)  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  (a)  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE

     In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Adviser
to the Fund pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Fund will pay
the Adviser an investment management fee (the

"Investment Management Fee"), equal to 1% on an annualized basis of the Fund's
net assets calculated based on the Fund's net asset value at the end of each
month, payable quarterly in arrears. The Investment Management Fee will decrease
the net profits or increase the net losses of the Fund that are credited to or
debited against the capital accounts of its limited partners. For the six months
ended June 30, 2006, $2,140,247 was incurred for Investment Management Fees.

  (b)  PLACEMENT AGENTS

     The Fund may engage one or more placement agents (each, a "Placement
Agent") to solicit investments in the Fund. Sanders Morris Harris, Inc. ("SMH"),
an affiliate of the General Partner and the Adviser, has been engaged to serve
as a Placement Agent. SMH is a full-service investment banking, broker-dealer,
asset management and financial services organization. A Placement Agent may
engage one or more sub-placement agents. The Adviser or its affiliates may pay a
fee out of their own resources to Placement Agents and sub-placement agents.

(9)  INDEBTEDNESS OF THE FUND

     Pursuant to the Fund LP Agreement, the Fund may borrow up to, but not more
than, 10% of net assets of the Fund (at the time such borrowings were made and
after taking into account the investment and/or deployment of such proceeds) for
the purpose of making investments, funding redemptions and for other working
capital and general Fund purposes. For purposes of the Fund's investment
restrictions and certain investment limitations under the 1940 Act, including
for example, the Fund's leverage limitations, the Fund will not "look through"
Investment Funds in which the Fund invests. Investment Funds may also use
leverage, whether through borrowings, futures, or other derivative products and
are not subject to the Fund's investment restrictions. However, such borrowings
by Investment Funds are without recourse to the Fund and the Fund's risk of loss
is limited to its investment in such Investment Funds, other than for some
Investment Funds in which the Fund made a capital commitment. For some
Investment Funds in which the Fund has made a capital commitment that will be
funded over a period of time, such as private equity and real estate funds, the
Fund, in certain instances, may commit to fund up to twice its initial capital
commitment. The rights of any lenders to the Fund to receive payments of
interest or repayments of principal will be senior to those of the partners, and
the terms of any borrowings may contain provisions that limit certain activities
of the Fund.

     The Fund maintains a credit facility for which the investments of the Fund
serve as collateral for the facility. The maximum amount that can be borrowed is
based on the value of the underlying collateral; provided, however, that the
Fund's fundamental policies provide that the Fund cannot borrow more than 10% of
the value of the Fund's net assets. As of June 30, 2006, there was no
outstanding balance under the credit facility. The weighted average interest
rate paid on the line of credit through June 30, 2006 was 7.08%.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

     At a meeting of the Board held on January 18, 2006, the Board considered
and approved the Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and the
Adviser and the Sub-Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and Tanglewood Asset
Management LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"). In reviewing these agreements, the Board
requested information, which was provided by the Adviser, that was reasonably
necessary for the Board to evaluate the agreements, and was advised by counsel.
Following its review, the Board concluded that the Investment Management
Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement enables the Fund's partners to obtain high
quality services at a cost that is appropriate, reasonable, and in the best
interests of investors based upon the following determinations, among others:

     The nature, extent and quality of the advisory service to be
provided.  Based on the nature and quality of the services provided by the
Adviser and Sub-Adviser to the Fund in the past (as well as services anticipated
to be provided in the future), the Adviser's management capabilities
demonstrated with respect to the Fund, the Adviser's management oversight
process, and the professional qualifications and experience of the Adviser's
investment committee and the Sub-Adviser's personnel, the Board concluded that
each of the Adviser and Sub-Adviser is capable of providing high quality
services to the Fund. The Board also concluded that each of the Adviser and Sub-
Adviser would provide the same quality and quantity of investment management and
related services as provided in the past, that these services are appropriate in
scope and extent in light of the Fund's operations, the competitive landscape of
the investment company business and investor needs and that the Adviser's and
Sub-Adviser's advisory obligations will remain the same in all respects.

     The investment performance of the Fund.  The Board concluded, based on
comparative performance information compiled by the Adviser, that the Fund's
investment performance was superior to the performance of its comparative index
and competitive or superior relative to comparable funds. On the basis of the
Directors' assessment of the nature, extent and quality of investment advisory
and related services to be provided or procured by the Adviser, the Directors
concluded that the Adviser (with the assistance of the Sub-Adviser) was capable
of generating a level of long-term investment performance that is appropriate in
light of the Fund's investment objective, policies and strategies and
competitive with many other comparable funds.

     The cost of advisory service provided and the level of profitability.  On
the basis of the Board's review of the fees to be charged by the Adviser for
investment advisory and related services, the unique nature of the Fund's
investment program, the Adviser's financial information, the fees paid by the
Adviser to the Sub-Adviser, the costs associated with managing the Fund and the
estimated profitability of the Adviser's relationships with the Fund, the Board
concluded that the level of investment management fees and the profitability is
appropriate in light of the services provided, the management fees and overall
expense ratios of comparable investment companies, and the anticipated
profitability of the relationship between the Fund and the Adviser. Further, on
the basis of comparative information supplied by the Adviser, the Board
determined that the management fees and estimated overall expense ratio of the
Fund were competitive with comparable investment companies.

                      SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
                            JUNE 30, 2006 (CONTINUED)

     The extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows
and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of Fund
investors.  While noting that the management fees will not decrease as the level
of Fund assets increase, the Board concluded that the management fees
appropriately reflect the Fund's current size, the current economic environment
for the Adviser, and the competitive nature of the investment company market as
relevant to the Fund. In addition, the Board noted that it will have the
opportunity to periodically re-examine whether the Fund has achieved economies
of scale, as well as the appropriateness of management fees payable to the
Adviser and Sub-Adviser, in the future.

     Benefits (such as soft dollars) to the Adviser from its relationship with
the Fund.  The Board concluded that other benefits derived by the Adviser from
its relationship with the Fund are reasonable and fair, result from the
provision of appropriate services to the Fund and investors therein, and are
consistent with industry practice and the best interests of the Fund and its
partners. In this regard, the Board noted that the Adviser does not realize
"soft dollar" benefits from its relationship with the Fund.

     Other considerations.  The Board also determined that the Adviser has made
a substantial commitment to the recruitment and retention of high quality
personnel, and maintained the financial, compliance and operational resources
reasonably necessary to manage the Fund in a professional manner that is
consistent with the best interests of the Fund and its partners. The Directors
also concluded that the Adviser has made a significant entrepreneurial
commitment to the management and success of the Fund.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded, based on their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures as conducted within 90 days of the filing date of this
report, that these disclosure controls and procedures are adequately designed
and are operating effectively to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the registrant on Form N-CSR is (i) accumulated and communicated to

timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (ii) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
