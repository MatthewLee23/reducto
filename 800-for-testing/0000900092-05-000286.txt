These reports, including the financial information herein, are transmitted
to shareholders of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. for their information. This is not a
prospectus. The Funds have leveraged their Common Stock and intend to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with potentially higher rates of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Past performance results shown in these

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


The Funds utilize leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value
of their Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all
interest rate environments. To leverage, each Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these
investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock
shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio
holdings is reflected in the per share net asset value of each Fund's Common
Stock. However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve
must be positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower
than long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of
these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh
the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of
Preferred Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time,
the fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term
interest rates.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's
investments, since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate.
In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's
Common Stock may also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Funds may invest in certain
securities whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a
floating interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse
floaters will decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase
when short-term interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be
characterized as derivative securities and may subject the Funds to the risks
of reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In
addition, inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage
and, as a result, the market value of such securities will generally be more
volatile than that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the
Funds invest in inverse floaters, the market value of each Fund's portfolio and
the net asset value of each Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the
Funds did not invest in such securities. As of May 31, 2005, the percentage of
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.'s total net assets invested in inverse
floaters was 1.21%, before the deduction of Preferred Stock. As of May 31,
2005, none of Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.'s total net
assets was invested in inverse floaters.

A Letter From the President


Dear Shareholder

After expanding at an annualized rate of 4.4% in 2004, U.S. gross
domestic product grew at an estimated 3.5% in the first quarter of
2005. The slowdown was not entirely unexpected given last year's
healthy growth and the evolution of the economic cycle. The Federal
Reserve Board - with one eye firmly affixed on the economic indicators
and the other on inflationary measures - has increased the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points (.25%) at each of its eight meetings
since June 2004. At period-end, the target short-term interest rate
stood at 3%.

U.S. equity markets ended 2004 in a strong rally, but have struggled
to record meaningful gains in 2005. The potential for slowing economic
and corporate earnings growth, as well as volatile energy prices, have
intermittently hampered equity market progress. On the positive side,
corporate transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions, stock buy-
backs and dividend payouts, have all increased. In Asia, equities have
continued to benefit from higher economic growth prospects and
valuations that appear inexpensive relative to other parts of the
world.

In the bond market, the yield curve flattening "conundrum" continued
as short-term and long-term yields moved still closer together. Over
the past year, the two-year Treasury yield increased 106 basis points
while the 10-year Treasury yield declined 66 basis points. At May 31,
2005, the two-year Treasury note yielded 3.60% and the 10-year
Treasury note yielded 4%. The falling long-term rates may be partly
attributed to foreign interest in U.S. assets and increased issuance
of short-term Treasury bonds to finance the federal deficit. Notably,
the government is considering the reissuance of the 30-year Treasury,
which was suspended in August 2001. This would allow the U.S. Treasury
to adopt a more flexible approach to borrowing, while providing
investors with another long-term fixed income option.

Amid these conditions, the major benchmarks posted six-month and
12-month returns as follows:

encourage you to meet with your financial advisor to review your goals

A Discussion With Your Funds' Portfolio Managers


The Funds provided attractive total returns for the year as we remained focused
on maintaining a competitive yield and protecting net asset value in a volatile
interest rate environment.


Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Amid significant volatility, long-term bond yields moved sharply lower over the
past 12 months as short-term interest rates increased. For all of 2004, real
gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualized rate of 4.4%, well ahead of
2003's annual rate of 3%. The initial estimate of first quarter 2005 GDP growth
came in at 3.5%, in keeping with many economists' expectations.

It appeared that continued economic improvements were generally disregarded as
investors focused on inflationary trends, currency-related demand for long-term
U.S. securities, slowing foreign economies and interest rate action on the part
of the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed). Over the past 12 months, 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond yields declined 103 basis points (1.03%) to 4.32%, while 10-year
Treasury note yields fell 66 basis points to 4%. The Fed, in the meantime,
continued to raise short-term interest rates at each of its meetings since June
2004, bringing the federal funds rate to 3% by period-end. As short-term
interest rates increased while longer-term interest rates fell, the yield curve
continued to flatten.

In the tax-exempt market, yields on 30-year revenue bonds, as measured by the
Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, fell 58 basis points to 4.78% during the year.
According to Municipal Market Data, yields on AAA-rated issues maturing in
30 years declined 73 basis points to 4.26%, while AAA-rated bonds maturing
in 10 years saw their yields decline 44 basis points to 3.49%.

Over the past year, nearly $375 billion in long-term municipal securities
was underwritten, roughly in line with last year's issuance of $385 billion.
During the last six months, more than $186 billion in tax-exempt bonds was
underwritten, an increase of 7.5% versus the same period a year earlier.
Issuance so far in 2005 has been boosted by more than a 40% increase in
refunding issues as municipalities have sought to refinance existing higher-
coupon debt. These refunding issues have been heavily weighted in the
10-year - 20-year maturity range to lower the overall interest cost of the
refunding issue. This concentration has put pressure on intermediate tax-exempt
bond yields while supporting longer-term bond prices.

Investor demand for municipal product remained generally positive during the
period. Investment Company Institute statistics indicate that, year-to-date
through April 30, 2005, net new cash flows into long-term municipal bond funds
exceeded $697 million. This represented a significant improvement from the
$2.86 billion net outflow seen during the same period in 2004. Throughout much
of the past 12 months, high yield tax-exempt bond funds experienced very
positive net cash flows. During May, these lower-rated/non-rated bond funds
received an average of $175 million per week. The need to invest these ongoing
cash flows has led to strong demand for lower-rated issues and a resultant
narrowing of credit spreads.

Looking ahead, we would expect the long-term municipal market to perform much
like the U.S. Treasury market. The tax-exempt market's supply/demand position
remains generally favorable. The refunding deals that inflated new-issue supply
so far in 2005 are not likely to be repeated later in the year. Municipal bond
issues have underperformed their taxable counterparts in recent months as U.S.
Treasury bonds enjoyed increased demand from foreign governments, which are
unable to benefit from the tax advantage inherent in tax-exempt products. This
underperformance, however, has resulted in very attractive tax-exempt bond
yield ratios. At 95% - 102%, tax-exempt bond yield ratios are well above recent
historic averages. We believe this should continue to attract both traditional
and nontraditional investors to the marketplace, particularly if new municipal
bond issuance remains modest.


Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year?

For the 12-month period ended May 31, 2005, the Common Stock of Muni
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 5.57% and 6.20%,
based on a year-end per share net asset value of $15.51 and a per share market
price of $13.94, respectively, and $.864 per share income dividends. Over the
same period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was
+15.36%, based on a change in per share net asset value from $14.52 to $15.51,
and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                 MAY 31, 2005



The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the +12.69% average
return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for
the 12-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in
municipal debt issues rated in the top four credit-rating categories. These
funds can be leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse
repurchase agreements.) The Fund's outperformance is primarily attributed to
two factors - an overweight exposure to spread product, which benefited from a
continued narrowing of credit spreads, and the Fund's yield curve strategies.

In general, credit spreads on lower investment grade and non-investment grade
securities narrowed due to improvements in corporate balance sheets and
municipal government finances. This improvement in creditworthiness and the low
level of absolute interest rates caused an increase in demand for securities
providing incremental yield. Several of the same credits that contributed to
the Fund's outperformance in previous periods continued to enjoy above-average
price appreciation during the past 12 months. Among them were the bonds of
Pocahontas Parkway, a tollroad in Virginia, which improved following increases
in both toll rates and traffic flow. Spreads on the bonds of National Gypsum
Company, a producer of wallboard for the building industry, continued to
contract on positive earnings releases derived from the strong housing market.

In terms of our yield curve positioning, the Fund began the period with an
emphasis on bonds with maturities between 15 years and 20 years. After the
municipal yield curve steepened to historical levels, we shifted the Fund's
maturity focus to longer maturities (specifically, between 23 years and
28 years). The recent flattening of the yield curve has helped the Fund's
performance as bonds with slightly longer maturities outperformed the broader
market. Notably, although we extended the final maturities out, the Fund's
premium coupon structure enabled us to stay within our intermediate duration
parameters.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2005, the total investment return on the
Fund's Common Stock was +6.84%, based on a change in per share net asset value
from $15.19 to $15.51, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights
section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As
a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the
Fund's Common Stock may vary significantly from total investment returns based
on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


What changes were made to the portfolio during the year?

Over the past 12 months, we concentrated on reducing the Fund's exposure to
spread product and reinvesting the proceeds in the high-grade market, where we
believe a better balance of risk and reward exists. In particular, we reduced
exposure to credits rated BBB and lower, as these securities significantly
outperformed the broader market over the past 20 months.

Purchases during the past 12 months have been aimed at capitalizing on the
relative cheapness of AAA-rated New York, New Jersey and California tax-exempt
bonds. The Fund increased exposure to these states' debt as an increase in new-
issue supply caused a temporarily weak technical market, and presented us with
attractive buying opportunities. In addition, we've taken advantage of the
recent yield curve flattening by shifting a portion of the portfolio's assets
back into the 20-year sector of the curve. Relative value returned to the
20-year sector, allowing us to increase our exposures in that segment of
the curve.

For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the Fund's Auction Market Preferred
Stock (AMPS) had an average yield of 1.89% for Series M7, 1.93% for Series T7,
1.88% for Series W7, 1.91% for Series TH7 and 1.85% for Series F7. The Fed's
interest rate increases are beginning to have an impact on the Fund's borrowing
costs. The Fed raised the short-term interest rate target 200 basis points
during the 12-month period. Still, the tax-exempt yield curve has remained
relatively steep, continuing to generate a material income benefit to the
holders of Common Stock from the leveraging of Preferred Stock. However, should
the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits
of leveraging will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's
Common Stock. At the end of the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due to
AMPS, was 32.58% of total net assets. (For a more complete explanation of the
benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 2 of this report to shareholders.)



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                 MAY 31, 2005



A Discussion With Your Funds' Portfolio Managers (concluded)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

Our primary focus is on maintaining the portfolio's current yield and
protecting the Fund's net asset value in case of a future rise in long-term
interest rates. Despite slower GDP growth in the first quarter of 2005, we
expect the economy to continue to remain healthy over the next several
quarters, pushing interest rates slightly higher. We will continue to reduce
our exposure to spread product with the expectation of reaching a market-
neutral exposure within the next three months.


Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


Describe conditions in the State of New York.

The State of New York maintains credit ratings of A1, AA and AA- from Moody's,
Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Fitch, respectively. Moody's assigns a positive
outlook to the state's rating, reflecting an upgrade in November, while Fitch
and S&P carry stable outlooks. The state economy continues to improve and
revenue collections are increasing.

Recently, for the first time in more than 20 years, New York lawmakers approved
a budget on time. The fiscal year 2006 budget calls for $105 billion in
spending and forecasts a 5% increase in tax receipts. Aided by this revenue
growth, the adopted budget includes the governor's original proposals for
closing an estimated $4 billion deficit. However, this does not factor in a
lawsuit recently won by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity that could add up to
$2 billion in annual state education spending. Crafting balanced budgets beyond
fiscal year 2006 will present a challenge given political resistance to
additional tax hikes and cuts in popular programs, as well as pressure from
local governments for pension and Medicaid relief, and new education spending.

The economy produced good job growth in 2004, with total non-farm labor
increasing .5% from the prior year. This was the first annual gain since 2000.
New York ranks fifth-highest among all states in per capita income. Modest
income growth during 2005 would boost personal income tax receipts, roughly 38%
of general fund receipts.


How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year?

For the 12-month period ended May 31, 2005, the Common Stock of Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 4.78% and 5.36%,
based on a year-end per share net asset value of $15.05 and a per share market
price of $13.44, respectively, and $.720 per share income dividends. Over the
same period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +9.99%,
based on a change in per share net asset value from $14.45 to $15.05, and
assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, lagged the +12.70% average
return of the Lipper New York Municipal Debt Funds category for the 12-month
period. (Funds in this Lipper category limit their investment to securities
exempt from taxation in New York or a city in New York.) Notably, the Lipper
category consists primarily of funds with the ability to invest in municipal
issues with longer durations, whereas the Fund is limited to bonds in the
intermediate duration range. This placed the Fund at a disadvantage relative to
the Lipper average as the yield curve flattened considerably during the past
year, causing shorter-duration and intermediate-duration bonds to underperform
longer-dated municipal investments.

Fund performance during the year largely reflected our relatively short
duration - a function of our investment parameters, but also indicative of
our expectation that interest rates would rise all along the yield curve. Given
the Fed's well advertised monetary tightening campaign, we felt it prudent to
shorten duration (or sensitivity to interest rate changes) to reduce volatility
in the portfolio and mitigate the negative price impact associated with rising
interest rates. However, the expected rise in long-term interest rates never
materialized, and our relatively short duration hindered the Fund's total
return. Performance also was affected by the fact that the Fund was brought to
market in 2003 in a relatively low interest rate environment. Little has
changed since that time, leaving the Fund with lower-yielding bonds than many
of its peers. Despite that fact, we have been able to maintain the Fund's
attractive distribution rate while also modestly increasing the Fund's dividend
reserves. These reserves, representing excess income earned by the Fund, are
retained to benefit shareholders at a future time, and should enable the Fund
to maintain its current distribution rate in the near term.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2005, the total investment return on the
Fund's Common Stock was +4.34%, based on a change in per share net asset value
from $14.82 to $15.05, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                 MAY 31, 2005



For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights
section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As
a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the
Fund's Common Stock may vary significantly from total investment returns based
on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


What changes were made to the portfolio during the year?

We continued to focus on generating attractive tax-exempt income for our
shareholders. To that end, we essentially remained fully invested throughout
the period and employed tax-loss swaps to improve the Fund's book yield, when
market conditions permitted. We also retained our positions in better-
performing credits, those being bonds rated BB and BBB, and sought to add to
our BBB holdings. Our efforts have been somewhat successful, as the Fund's
exposure to BBB-rated credits increased from approximately 10% of net assets
to roughly 16% by period-end. At the same time, we reduced exposure to one
of the poorer performers - the AA sector - from about 25% of net assets to
approximately 16%. Notably, lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds that have been
performing well as credit spreads (versus higher-quality issues of comparable
maturity) continued to contract over the past several months. For example,
airline credits and bonds backed by tobacco revenues were among the market's
better performers during the year and, to the extent that we had exposure to
these lower-rated credits, the Fund's performance benefited.

While looking to enhance income for shareholders, primarily by retaining bonds
booked in the portfolio at yields higher than those available in the current
market, we have seen some erosion in the Fund's average duration. As part of
our ongoing strategy, we continue to look for opportunities to add longer-dated
bonds with attractive yields to the portfolio to improve duration and also to
mitigate the negative impact on total return as higher-coupon bonds are called
at their earliest call date. Should the new-issue market pick up, in terms of
offering more varied names, this could potentially allow us more opportunities
to sell out of shorter-call bonds and move into the lower end of the investment
grade spectrum (BB and BBB), where we have identified the most compelling
relative value. We have seen more opportunities come to market in that area,
and are hopeful that this will allow us to accomplish our restructuring goals
without sacrificing a great deal of yield already booked into the portfolio.

For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the average yield for the Fund's Auction
Market Preferred Stock (AMPS) was 1.89%. The Fed's interest rate increases are
beginning to have an impact on the Fund's borrowing costs. The Fed raised the
short-term interest rate target 200 basis points during the 12-month period.
Still, the tax-exempt yield curve has remained relatively steep, continuing to
generate a material income benefit to the holders of Common Stock from the
leveraging of Preferred Stock. However, should the spread between short-term
and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of leveraging will decline
and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. At the end of
the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due to AMPS, was 32.88% of total net
assets. (For a more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of
leveraging, see page 2 of this report to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We continue to maintain a fully invested portfolio, and are looking to the new-
issue market for opportunities to increase the Fund's duration. We are
targeting BBB-rated bonds for both their total return potential and attractive
income. Our analysis has found the BBB and BB sectors to be among the market's
top performers, and we expect that trend to continue.

After eight consecutive interest rate hikes, we believe the Fed is closer to
the end than the beginning of its monetary tightening program. Thus, it would
seem that the risk of significantly higher interest rates is somewhat
diminished. However, we do anticipate a considerable amount of volatility in
the financial markets in the near term given inflation concerns and
increasingly mixed economic releases. We expect that this could provide an
opportunity to approach a more neutral duration stance as we aim to trade into
higher yields as the portfolio's shorter bonds are called away.

Notes to Financial Statements


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and Muni New York Intermediate Duration
Fund, Inc. (the "Funds" or individually as the "Fund") are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end
management investment companies. The Funds' financial statements are prepared
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may
require the use of management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The Funds determine and make available for publication
the net asset values of their Common Stock on a daily basis. Each Fund's Common
Stock shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MUI for
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and MNE for Muni New York Intermediate
Duration Fund, Inc.

(a) Valuation of investments--Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the over-
the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price in
the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Funds under the general
direction of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are
reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Funds. Financial futures
contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at
their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or
purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded
options. In the case of options traded in the OTC market, valuation is the last
asked price (options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap
agreements are valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Funds'
pricing service. Short-term investments with a remaining maturity of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, under which
method the investment is valued at cost and any premium or discount is
amortized on a straight line basis to maturity. Investments in open-end
investment companies are valued at their net asset value each business day.
Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Funds.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--Each Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, their exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the
securities markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the
contract or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract.

* Financial futures contracts--Each Fund may purchase or sell financial futures
contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts are
contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date and at a
specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund deposits and
maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on
which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known as
variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and
the value at the time it was closed.

* Options--Each Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the Fund
writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is
reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability
is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from)
the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a closing
transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent of
the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost of the
closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


* Forward interest rate swaps--Each Fund may enter into forward interest rate
swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty agree to
make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract amount, commencing
on a specified future effective date, unless terminated earlier. When the
agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount
equal to the value of the agreement. These periodic payments received or made
by the Fund is recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized
gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are also realized upon
termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market daily based on
dealer-supplied valuations and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the swap
agreements.

(c) Income taxes--It is each Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds amortize all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(f) Offering expenses--Direct expenses relating to the public offering of each
Fund's Preferred Stock were charged to capital at the time of issuance of the
shares.

(g) Reclassifications--U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require
that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent
differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly, during the
current year, $86,923 has been reclassified between undistributed net
investment income and undistributed net realized capital gains as a result of
permanent differences attributable to amortization methods on fixed income
securities in the Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. This reclassification
has no effect on net assets or net asset values per share.

There were no reclassifications for Muni New York Intermediate Duration
Fund, Inc.


2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services,
Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
("ML & Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of each Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to the operations of the Funds. For such services, each Fund pays a monthly fee
at an annual rate of .55% of the Fund's average daily net assets, including
proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock. FAM has contractually agreed to
waive a portion of its fee during the first seven years of each Fund's
operations ending July 31, 2010, as follows:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.
and Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets of Muni Intermediate
Duration Fund, Inc. and Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. (the
"Funds"), including the schedules of investments, as of May 31, 2005, and the
related statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets and financial highlights for the year then ended and for
the period August 1, 2003 (commencement of operations) to May 31, 2004. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of May 31, 2005, by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Muni
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund,
Inc. at May 31, 2005, the results of their operations for the year then ended,
the changes in their net assets and the financial highlights for the respective
periods then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

ANNUAL REPORTS                                                 MAY 31, 2005


Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan


The following description of the Funds' Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required by federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Funds' Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock otherwise elects,
all dividend and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested
by EquiServe (the "Plan Agent"), as agent for shareholders in administering the
Plan, in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. Holders of Common Stock
who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash
paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the shares
are held in street or other nominee name then to such nominee) by EquiServe, as
dividend paying agent. Such participants may elect not to participate in the
Plan and to receive all distributions of dividends and capital gains in cash by
sending written instructions to EquiServe, as dividend paying agent, at the
address set forth below. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and
may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by written notice if
received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior to any dividend record
date; otherwise such termination will be effective with respect to any
subsequently declared dividend or distribution.

Whenever the Funds declare an income dividend or capital gains distribution
(collectively referred to as "dividends") payable either in shares or in cash,
non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan
will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be
acquired by the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon the
circumstances described below, either (i) through receipt of additional
unissued but authorized shares of Common Stock from each Fund ("newly issued
shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open
market ("open-market purchases") on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
If, on the payment date for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the
Common Stock is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common
Stock plus estimated brokerage commissions (such conditions being referred to
herein as "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in
newly issued shares on behalf of the participant. The number of newly issued
shares of Common Stock to be credited to the participant's account will be
determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value
per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount
from the then current market price per share on the date of issuance may not
exceed 5%. If, on the dividend payment date, the net asset value per share is
greater than the market value (such condition being referred to herein as
"market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares
acquired on behalf of the participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the Plan Agent
will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no event more than 30 days after the
dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest the dividend amount
in shares acquired in open-market purchases. It is contemplated that each Fund
will pay monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which open-
market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date on the
dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date, which typically
will be approximately ten days. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
open-market purchases, the market price of a share of Common Stock exceeds the
net asset value per share, the average per share purchase price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of each Fund's shares, resulting in
the acquisitions of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in newly
issued shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty
with respect to open-market purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Agent
is unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during
the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during
the purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market purchases and
will invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued
shares at the close of business on the last purchase date determined by
dividing the uninvested portion of the dividend by the net asset value per
share.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                 MAY 31, 2005



The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all
proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold
shares of others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer
the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by
the record shareholders as representing the total amount registered in the
record shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are
to participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by
the Funds as a result of dividends or capital gains distributions payable
either in shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-
market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not available
to shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the market price plus
commissions of the Funds' shares is above the net asset value, participants in
the Plan will receive shares of the Funds at less than they could otherwise
purchase them and will have shares with a cash value greater than the value of
any cash distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market
price plus commissions is below the net asset value, participants will receive
distributions in shares with a net asset value greater than the value of any
cash distribution they would have received on their shares. However, there may
be insufficient shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Funds do not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be excluded
from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would be
excluded from gross income. If, when each Fund's shares are trading at a
premium over net asset value, each Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that
have a greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is
possible that all or a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the
fair market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable
distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also
possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all
the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan.
Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Funds reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Funds reserve the
right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the
participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Agent at EquiServe, P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010,
Telephone: 800-426-5523.

Swap Agreements


The Funds may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts
in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in
market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for
periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in
market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may
be used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party
with whom each Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to
pay the Funds and the risk that the Funds will not be able to meet their
obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.


Availability of Quarterly Schedule of Investments


The Funds file their complete schedules of portfolio holdings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the first and third quarters
of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Funds' Forms N-Q are available on the

Item 2 -   Code of Ethics - The registrant has adopted a code of ethics, as of
           the end of the period covered by this report, that applies to the
           registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial officer
           and principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar
           functions.  A copy of the code of ethics is available without charge
           upon request by calling toll-free 1-800-MER-FUND (1-800-637-3863).

Item 3 -   Audit Committee Financial Expert - The registrant's board of
           directors has determined that (i) the registrant has the following
           audit committee financial experts serving on its audit committee and
           (ii) each audit committee financial expert is independent: (1) Donald
           W. Burton, (2) M. Colyer Crum (retired as of December 31, 2004), (3)
           Laurie Simon Hodrick, (4) John F. O'Brien (as of November 22, 2004),
           (5) David H. Walsh and (6) Fred G. Weiss.

           The registrant's board of directors has determined that Laurie Simon
           Hodrick and M. Colyer Crum qualify as financial experts pursuant to
           Item 3(c)(4) of Form N-CSR.

           Ms. Hodrick has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
           accounting principals, financial statements, and internal controls
           and procedures for financial reporting. Ms. Hodrick earned a Ph.D. in
           economics and has taught courses in finance for over 15 years. Her
           M.B.A.-level course centers around the evaluation and analysis of
           firms' corporate financial statements. She has also taught in
           financial analysts' training programs. Ms. Hodrick has also worked
           with several prominent corporations in connection with the analysis
           of financial forecasts and projections and analysis of the financial
           statements of those companies, serving on the Financial Advisory
           Council of one of these major corporations. She has also served
           as the Treasurer and Finance Chair of a 501(c)(3) organization.
           Ms. Hodrick has published a number of articles in leading economic
           and financial journals and is the associate editor of two leading
           finance journals.

           M. Colyer Crum also possesses a thorough understanding of generally
           accepted accounting principals, financial statements, and internal
           controls and procedures for financial reporting through a combination
           of education and experience.  Professor Crum was a professor of
           investment management at the Harvard Business School for 25 years.
           The courses taught by Professor Crum place a heavy emphasis on the
           analysis of underlying company financial statements with respect to
           stock selection and the analysis of credit risk in making loans.
           Professor Crum has also served on a number of boards of directors and
           has served on the audit committees, and in some cases chaired the
           audit committee, for several major corporations and financial
           institutions.  For two such organizations, Professor Crum has
           performed extensive investment analysis of financial statements in
           connection with investment management decisions.  From these
           experiences, he has gained significant experience with the
           establishment of reserves and accounting policies, differences
           between U.S. GAAP and Canadian GAAP and executive compensation
           issues.

     policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
     Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the registrant
     on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the Committee.  The
     Committee also must approve other non-audit services provided to the
     registrant and those non-audit services provided to the registrant's
     affiliated service providers that relate directly to the operations and the
     financial reporting of the registrant.  Certain of these non-audit services
     that the Committee believes are a) consistent with the SEC's auditor
     independence rules and b) routine and recurring services that will not
     impair the independence of the independent accountants may be approved by
     the Committee without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis
     ("general pre-approval").  However, such services will only be deemed pre-
     approved provided that any individual project does not exceed $5,000
     attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for all of the registrants the
     Committee oversees.  Any proposed services exceeding the pre-approved cost
     levels will require specific pre-approval by the Committee, as will any
     other services not subject to general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but
     permissible services).  The Committee is informed of each service approved
     subject to general pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person
     board meeting.

Item 6 -   Schedule of Investments - Not Applicable

Item 7 -   Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
           Management Investment Companies -

           Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

           Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill
           Lynch Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P.
           (the "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to
           the Fund's portfolio securities.  The Investment Adviser has adopted
           policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to
           the voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
           account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund.  Pursuant to
           these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
           objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions
           solely in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and
           to act in a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most
           likely to enhance the economic value of the securities held by the
           Fund.  The Proxy Voting Procedures are designed to ensure that the
           Investment Adviser considers the interests of its clients, including
           the Funds, and not the interests of the Investment Adviser, when
           voting proxies and that real (or perceived) material conflicts that
           may arise between the Investment Adviser's interest and those of the
           Investment Adviser's clients are properly addressed and resolved.

           In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
           Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee").
           The Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief
           Investment Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment
           professionals appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment
           analysts appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems
           appropriate.  The Committee will also include two non-voting
           representatives from the Investment Adviser's Legal department
           appointed by the Investment Adviser's General Counsel.  The
           Committee's membership shall be limited to full-time employees of the
           Investment Adviser.  No person with any investment banking, trading,
           retail brokerage or research responsibilities for the Investment
           Adviser's affiliates may serve as a member of the Committee or
           participate in its decision making (except to the extent such person
           is asked by the Committee to present information to the Committee, on
           the same basis as other interested knowledgeable parties not
           affiliated with the Investment Adviser might be asked to do so).
           The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of all clients,
           including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting authority to the
           Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes are consistent
           with the best interests of those clients and are free from
           unwarranted and inappropriate influences.  The Committee establishes
           general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser and is
           responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
           specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
           management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
           economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions.  In
           so doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
           manner contrary to its generally stated policies.  In addition, the
           Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
           recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

           The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
           proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires
           a case-by-case determination.  In such cases, the Committee may elect
           not to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue.
           The Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues
           require investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other
           significant corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions,
           and are, therefore, not suitable for general guidelines.  The
           Committee may elect to adopt a common position for the Investment
           Adviser on certain proxy votes that are akin to investment decisions,
           or determine to permit the portfolio manager to make individual
           decisions on how best to maximize economic value for a Fund (similar
           to normal buy/sell investment decisions made by such portfolio
           managers).  While it is expected that the Investment Adviser will
           generally seek to vote proxies over which the Investment Adviser
           exercises voting authority in a uniform manner for all the Investment
           Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction with a Fund's
           portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
           circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

           To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
           retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS").  ISS is an
           independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
           fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
           managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
           institutional investors.  The services provided to the Investment
           Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
           (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
           recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping.  ISS will also
           assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
           obligations under the Investment Company Act.

           The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
           circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting.  For
           instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
           generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio
           securities that are on loan, although it may do so under certain
           circumstances.  In addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies
           related to securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis
           and may elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the
           Committee determines that the costs associated with voting generally
           outweigh the benefits.  The Committee may at any time override these
           general policies if it determines that such action is in the best
           interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved.  The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest.  The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients.  If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

           In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an
           independent fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an
           independent fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a
           subcommittee, appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary
           of the Committee), consisting solely of Committee members selected
           by the CIO.  The CIO shall appoint to the subcommittee, where
           appropriate, only persons whose job responsibilities do not include
           contact with the Client and whose job evaluations would not be
           affected by the Investment Adviser's relationship with the Client
           (or failure to retain such relationship).  The subcommittee shall
           determine whether and how to vote all proxies on behalf of the
           Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is, in their
           judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the applicable
           portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee determines to
           alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines or, on
           matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case, does
           not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service or
           other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
           or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies
           relating to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the
           Secretary's absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs
           that the subcommittee's determination is consistent with the
           Investment Adviser's fiduciary duties

           In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
           Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain
           recurring proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual
           circumstances.  These policies are guidelines only, and the
           Investment Adviser may elect to vote differently from the
           recommendation set forth in a voting guideline if the Committee
           determines that it is in a Fund's best interest to do so.  In
           addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any time upon the request
           of a Committee member and may be amended or deleted upon the vote of
           a majority of Committee members present at a Committee meeting at
           which there is a quorum.

           The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
           respect to the following proxy issues:

*  Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
   other than investment companies.  As a general matter, the Committee
   believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
   most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
   company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
   corporate policy and oversee management.  The Committee, therefore, believes
   that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election of
   qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
   represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
   corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
   time.  In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history of
   representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or other
   factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

*  Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors.  As
   a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
   responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
   independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
   corporate management.  While the Committee will generally defer to a
   corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may look
   at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as auditor of
   other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

*  Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits.  As a
   general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's compensation
   and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but believes that
   compensation matters are normally best determined by an issuer's board of
   directors, rather than shareholders.  Proposals to "micro-manage" an
   issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary restrictions on
   compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be supported.

*  Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval of
   amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure.  As a general
   matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
   common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
   dilutive.

*  Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
   charter or by-laws.  As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
   provisions.

*  Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of corporate
   meetings.

*  Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
   investment company shares.  As with other types of companies, the Committee
   believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders) is
   best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management.  However, the
   Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
   matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
   Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by shareholders.

*  Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that relates
   to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns.  The Committee
   generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are inappropriate forums
   for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes shareholder resolutions
   "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting release of information that
   would not help a shareholder evaluate an investment in the corporation as an
   economic matter.  While the Committee is generally supportive of proposals
   to require corporate disclosure of matters that seem relevant and material
   to the economic interests of shareholders, the Committee is generally not
   supportive of proposals to require disclosure of corporate matters for other
   purposes.

           (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal half-
           year of the period covered by this report that has materially
           affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the

   employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
   over financial reporting.
