PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE



July 21, 2004

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to let you know that FleetBoston Financial Corporation and Bank
of America Corporation have merged, effective April 1, 2004. As a result of the
merger, Columbia Management Group and your Colonial Investment Grade Municipal
Trust became part of the Bank of America family of companies. Looking ahead, we
believe this merger will be a real benefit to our shareholders. Preserving and
leveraging our strengths, the combined organization intends to deliver
additional research and management capabilities, as well as new products. There
are no immediate changes planned for fund names, product lines, or customer
service contacts.

As you might know, on March 15, 2004, FleetBoston Financial announced an
agreement in principle with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") and the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") to settle charges involving
market timing in Columbia Management mutual funds. (You may also know that Bank
of America came to a similar settlement in principle at the same time.) The
agreement requires the final approval of the SEC and the NYAG. This settlement
in principle reflects our strong wish to put this regrettable situation behind
us. Columbia Management has taken and will continue to take steps to strengthen
policies, procedures and oversight to curb frequent trading of Columbia open-end
fund shares.

Both your fund's trustees and Columbia Management are committed to serving the
interests of our shareholders, and we will continue to work hard to help you
achieve your financial goals.

As always, thank you for choosing Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust, and
for giving us the opportunity to help you build a strong financial future.

Sincerely,


/s/ Thomas C. Theobald              /s/ J. Kevin Connaughton

Thomas C. Theobald                      J. Kevin Connaughton
Chairman, Board of Trustees             President

J. Kevin Connaughton was named president of Colonial Investment Grade Municipal
Trust on February 27, 2004.

Sector breakdown is calculated as a percentage of net assets (including auction
preferred shares). Quality breakdown is calculated as a percentage of total
investments. Ratings shown in the quality breakdown represent the highest rating
assigned to a particular bond by one of the following nationally-recognized
rating agencies: Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
or Fitch Ratings Ltd.

Because the trust is actively managed, there is no guarantee that the trust will
continue to invest in these sectors or maintain this quality breakdown in the
future.





For the six-month period ended May 31, 2004, Colonial Investment Grade Municipal
Trust returned negative 2.01%, based on investment at net asset value. The trust
underperformed its peer group, the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds
(Leveraged) Category, which averaged a negative return of 0.58% for the same
period.1

The trust's relatively light exposure to lower quality, higher-yielding
bonds resulted in a dividend that was lower than its peer group during the
period. Duration was also a factor in the trust's relative underperformance.
Duration is a measure, expressed in years, of a bond's sensitivity to changes in
interest rates. Overall, the trust's duration was shorter than its peer group,
which hurt relative performance when interest rates declined during the first
part of the period. We positioned the trust with a shorter duration because we
expected a strengthening economy to push interest rates slightly higher and bond
prices lower. We made up some, but not all, of the performance shortfall when
interest rates moved higher near the end of the period.

The trust's above-average stake in zero coupon municipal bonds also hampered
relative returns. Zeroes are bought at a steep discount to face value and
appreciate to face value at maturity. They tend to have relatively long
durations and do not do well when interest rates rise, which occurred at the end
of the period. The market's fairly large supply of zeros also held back their
returns.

LEVERAGED POSITIONS PUT A DAMPER ON INVESTOR ENTHUSIASM
For the six-month period ended May 31, 2004, the trust posted an even lower
return of negative 5.83%, based on the market price of the stock, as the
discount to net asset value widened. As investors began to anticipate that
rising short-term interest rates could erode the income the trust earns on its
leveraged positions, the shares lost some ground. The trust's preferred shares,
issued in 1999, allowed the trust to borrow against its underlying investments.
We invested the proceeds from these shares in longer maturity, higher-yielding
bonds, while paying out a short-term rate that is influenced by the federal
funds rate. The trust earns the difference between the rate paid on the
preferred shares and the yield on the longer maturity securities. With the
federal funds rate at 1.0%, during this reporting period, the difference was
significant and resulted in added income for the trust. However, going forward,
if the trend is toward higher interest rates all around, we expect the rate paid
on the preferred

shares to rise, which could lower the income available to pay the dividend on
the common shares.

EMPHASIS ON INCREASING YIELD
Our focus throughout the period was on increasing yield from the trust's
investments. We added to our stake in lower-quality municipal bonds with higher
yields and reduced bonds, such as zeros, that are geared more toward price
appreciation. Some higher-yielding bonds helped performance. Of particular note
were securities issued by HealthEast, a Minnesota hospital, and Charter
Municipal Mortgage Acceptance Co., a pooled loan program for multi-family
housing (0.3% and 0.6% of total investments, respectively).2 Both benefited from
credit improvement. We also took advantage of the higher yields offered in the
health care and retirement community sectors, raising the trust's stake in both.
Elsewhere, we reduced the trust's reliance on hedging to manage duration.
However, as Treasuries trailed other sectors, the trust benefited by selling
Treasury futures contracts short.

LOOKING AHEAD TO RISING INTEREST RATES
We plan to maintain the trust's slightly short duration on the expectation that
interest rates will rise gradually as job gains fuel the economy while high oil
prices keep growth somewhat in check. In this environment, we expect to continue
to boost our stake in higher-yielding bonds.

Past performance is no guarantee of future investment results. Current
performance may be higher or lower than performance data shown.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-free income, but it also involves
certain risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Investing in
high-yield securities offers the potential for high current income and
attractive total return, but involves certain risks. Lower-rated bond risks
include default of the issuer and rising interest rates. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax
for individuals and corporations.

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION
Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts
business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"),
as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL
The Trust seeks as high a level of after-tax return as is consistent with
prudent risk, by pursuing current income generally exempt from ordinary federal
income tax and opportunities for long-term appreciation from a portfolio
primarily invested in investment grade municipal bonds.

TRUST SHARES
The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 2,400 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION
Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service approved by the
Trust's Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal,
institutional-size trading units of similar securities. The services may use
various pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations
are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid
quotation. Certain debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of
lesser quality, are priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial
condition of the issuer and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations
developed through pricing techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized
upon sale of the securities, and the potential variation may be greater for
those securities valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or quotations
which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures established by
and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost
is determined and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification
method for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

FUTURES CONTRACTS
The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
may invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. of the future
direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding
the variation margin recorded on the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin payable or receivable
and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies portfolio
securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in an amount
equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when
the contract is closed or expires.

DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES
The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the Trust
to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies cash or
liquid portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in an amount equal
to the delayed delivery commitment.

INCOME RECOGNITION
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Original issue discount is
accreted to interest income over the life of the security with a corresponding
increase in the cost basis. Premium and discount are amortized and accreted,
respectively, on all debt securities. Dividend income is recorded on ex-date.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2004 (Unaudited)

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS
The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will distribute
substantially all of its taxable or tax-exempt income, if any, for its tax year,
and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, the Trust
intends to distribute in each calendar year substantially all of its net
investment income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, such that
the Trust should not be subject to federal excise tax. Therefore, no federal
income or excise tax provision is recorded.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on ex-date. Distributions to
Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of each
dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally seven
days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on May 31, 2004, was 1.07%. For
the six months ended May 31, 2004, the Trust declared dividends to Auction
Preferred shareholders amounting to $277,032, representing an average APS
dividend rate of 0.93%.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION
The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended November 30, 2003
was as follows: Distributions paid from:

   Tax-Exempt Income                             $8,411,303
   Ordinary Income*                                  30,543
   Long-Term Capital Gains                               --

  * For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions, if any, are
    considered ordinary income distributions.

Unrealized appreciation and depreciation at May 31, 2004, based on cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes was:

   Unrealized appreciation                      $11,244,601
   Unrealized depreciation                       (5,865,241)
                                                -----------
      Net unrealized appreciation               $ 5,379,360
                                                -----------

The following capital loss carryforwards, determined as of November 30, 2003,
may be available to reduce taxable income arising from future net realized gains
on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code:

                                       ----------

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia") is the investment advisor to the
Trust. Prior to April 1, 2004, Columbia was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Trust's investment advisor, was acquired by Bank of
America Corporation ("BOA"). The acquisition did not change the way the Trust is
managed, the investment personnel assigned to manage the Trust or the fees paid
by the Trust.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE
Columbia provides administrative and other services to the Trust in addition to
investment advisory services. Columbia receives a monthly investment advisory
fee at the annual rate of 0.65% of the Trust's average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to the APS.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES
Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street"). As a result, Columbia pays the total fees received
to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to APS,
exceed $50 million, an additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is
calculated by taking into account the fees payable to State Street under the
Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to the average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to APS, of the Trust for that month. The Trust also
pays additional fees for pricing services based on the number of securities held
by the Trust. For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the Trust's annualized
effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.055%.

CUSTODY CREDITS
The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. The Trust could have invested a portion of the
assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement in an
income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES
The Trust pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates. The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred
compensation plan which may be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan
will be paid solely out of the Trust's assets.

OTHER
Columbia provides certain services to the Trust related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the Trust paid $744 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Other expenses" on the
Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $14,925,849 and
$14,164,707, respectively.

NOTE 6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust currently has outstanding 2,400 APS. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the Trust on any dividend payment date at the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on a daily
basis unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such dividends have
been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and in
accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies. Should
these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS not be
paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At May 31, 2004, there
were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS
AND CONTINGENCIES

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at May 31, 2004 invested
in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Illinois, New York and
Texas and their respective political subdivisions, agencies and public
authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to economic and political factors
adversely affecting issuers of the specific state's municipal securities than
are municipal bond funds that are not concentrated to the same extent in these
issuers.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES
Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. Government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk bonds." Economic
downturns may disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to
repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in interest rates would likely
have an adverse impact on the value of such obligations. Moreover, high-yield
securities may be less liquid to the extent there is no established secondary
market.

INDUSTRY FOCUS
The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Columbia and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. ("CFDI"), and certain of their
affiliates (collectively, "the Columbia Group") have received information
requests and subpoenas from various regulatory and law enforcement authorities
in connection with their investigations of late trading and market timing in
mutual funds, as well as other industry wide issues. The Columbia Group has not
uncovered any instances where Columbia or CFDI were knowingly involved in late
trading of mutual fund shares.

On February 24, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filed a
civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts against Columbia and CFDI, alleging that they had violated certain
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with trading activity in
mutual fund shares. Also on February 24, 2004, the New York Attorney General
("NYAG") filed a civil complaint in New York Supreme Court, County of New York
against Columbia and CFDI alleging that Columbia and CFDI had violated certain
New York anti-fraud statutes. If either Columbia or CFDI is unsuccessful in its
defense of these proceedings, it could be barred from serving as an investment
advisor or distributor for any investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (a "registered investment company").
Such results could prevent Columbia, CFDI or any company that is an affiliated
person of Columbia and CFDI from serving as an investment advisor or distributor
for any registered investment company, including your fund. Your fund has been
informed by Columbia and CFDI that, if these results occur, they will seek
exemptive relief from the SEC to permit them to continue to serve as your fund's
investment advisor and distributor. There is no assurance that such exemptive
relief will be granted. On March 15, 2004, Columbia and CFDI entered into
agreements in principle with the SEC Division of Enforcement and NYAG in
settlement of the charges. Under the agreements, Columbia and CFDI agreed, among
other things, to the following conditions: payment of $70 million in
disgorgement; payment of $70 million in civil penalties; an order requiring
Columbia and CFDI to cease and desist from violations of the antifraud
provisions and other provisions of the federal securities laws; governance
changes designed to maintain the independence of the mutual fund boards of
trustees and ensure compliance with securities laws and their fiduciary duties;
and retention of an independent consultant to review Columbia's and CFDI's
compliance policies and procedures. The agreement requires the final approval of
the SEC. In a separate agreement with the NYAG, the Columbia Group has agreed to
reduce mutual fund fees by $80 million over a five-year period.

As a result of these matters or any adverse publicity or other developments
resulting from them, there may be increased redemptions or reduced sales of fund
shares, which could increase transaction costs or operating expenses, or have
other adverse consequences for the funds.

In connection with the events described in detail above, various parties have
filed suit against certain funds, their Boards and/or FleetBoston (and
affiliated entities). These suits and certain regulatory investigations are
ongoing. Accordingly, an estimate of the financial impact of this litigation on
any fund, if any, cannot currently be made.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

COLONIAL INVESTMENT GRADE MUNICIPAL TRUST

Pursuant to the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all
shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
distributions reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Trust by
EquiServe (the "Plan Agent") unless a shareholder elects to receive cash.
Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee will have
distributions reinvested automatically by the broker or nominee in additional
shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the broker or the
nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash. If the
service is not available, such distributions will be paid in cash. Shareholders
whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact the
broker or nominee for details. All distributions to shareholders who elect not
to participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed directly to the
shareholder of record on the record date therefore by the Plan Agent as the
dividend disbursing agent.

Non-participants in the Plan will receive distributions in cash. Distributions
payable to participants in the Plan will be applied by the Plan Agent, acting as
agent for Plan participants, to the purchase of shares of the Trust. Such shares
will be purchased by the Plan Agent at the then current market price of such
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to his
account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any
fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's notice of election
to withdraw from the Plan must be received by the Plan Agent before the record
date for a dividend in order to be given effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting distributions. The Plan
Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of distributions will be paid
by the Trust. Each participant in the Plan will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of distributions. Purchase orders
from the participants in the Plan may be combined with those of other
participants and the price paid by any particular participant may be the average
of the price paid on various orders executed on behalf of groups of participants
in the Plan.

The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve participants of any
income tax that may be payable on such dividends or distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days' written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010, or by phone at
1-800-730-6001.
