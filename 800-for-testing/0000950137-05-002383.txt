PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

The J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index is generally representative of
high-yield securities. The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales
charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be
considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

Van Kampen High Income Trust II is managed by the Adviser's High Yield team.(1)
Current team members include Gordon Loery, Executive Director of the Adviser;
Josh Givelber, Vice President and Chad Liu, Vice Presidents of the Adviser; and
Sheila Finnerty, Managing Director of the Adviser.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The CSFB High Yield Index, a broad index for the high yield market, returned
11.95% for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2004. In discussing the high
yield market during 2004, it is worth noting that 2003 was one of the best years
ever for this asset class, with the CSFB Index returning almost 28%. That banner
year was driven by strong economic news and significantly improved corporate
earnings, combined with declining defaults and record inflows into the asset
class. The strong returns of 2003 continued through the end of January 2004.

Beginning in February 2004, however, the market's technical (i.e.,
supply/demand) situation changed. Though fundamental factors such as earnings
and default rate remained as strong as they had been during the prior 15-month
rally, demand receded as market participants grew concerned over the lack of job
creation in the U.S. economy. Many investors took profits and became more
risk-averse. Then, in early April, significant interest rate increases caused a
pronounced sell-off in high yield and throughout the fixed income markets. In
addition, because of the sustained rally in high yield that had previously taken
place, many of these bonds were priced at a premium. In a sense, we believe the
high yield market had run out of room to rally. At the same time, the high yield
market's new issue calendar continued to be robust, which had a negative impact
on the market's technical situation. This difficult environment persisted
through May 2004.

In June, the high yield sector rebounded, experiencing a solid seven-month run
through the end of 2004. The strong fundamental factors detailed above continued
during this time and the supply/demand situation improved as buyers returned to
the market. For each of the last seven months of 2004, high yield posted gains
of 1% or more, and was the best performing fixed-income asset class for the
year. As a measure of the high yield market's improvement over the 12-month
period, the spread of the CSFB High Yield Index declined compared with
Treasuries of similar maturity, from 486 basis points to 346 basis points. In a
similar vein, the average yield to maturity of high yield bonds declined from
8.34% at the end of 2003 to 7.56% at the close of 2004.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

A closed-end fund's return can be calculated based upon either the market price
or the net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by
dividing the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets,
less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while
market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ significantly. On an NAV basis, the trust outperformed its
benchmark, the J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index, though it underperformed the
index on a market-value basis. (See table below.)

During the period, three strategic decisions helped the trust's performance
most. First, the trust enjoyed favorable security selection within the housing
industry. Going back to late 2003, the trust had held several homebuilding
issues that performed well, while the performance of building products companies
had lagged. Early in 2004, we felt that homebuilding bonds had become
overpriced, and based on our analysis we sold most of the trust's allocation,
replacing these bonds with building products issues that performed extremely
well over the remainder of the period. Second, the trust benefited from its lack
of participation in airline bonds. Airlines were the worst performing sector
within the high yield market during the 12-month period. Third, our security
selection in the wireless communications and telecom sectors added to
performance as we avoided several credits that had poor business results while
our selections within this sector generally posted solid earnings.

The main detractor from performance during the period was security selection
within the utility, service and gaming/leisure sectors. In addition, the trust's
underweight in the metals/mining sector hurt performance as higher metal prices
led this sector to strong gains during 2004.

On an ongoing basis, we seek to maintain a balanced and well-diversified
portfolio. The trust's portfolio consists of approximately 150 issuers. This
level of diversification can reduce overall credit risk, yet also allow
sufficient average security size for strategic overweights. We continue to
maintain an average credit quality of single B, similar to the benchmark.
Beginning in late in 2003 and early 2004, we reduced the trust's allocation in
BBB and higher BB credits

as many of these issues had performed well when interest rates declined and
Treasuries and other fixed-income securities rallied. The performance of these
higher rated bonds generally correlates with that of Treasuries, and the trust
sold several BBB and BB credits before interest rates spiked in the spring and
Treasuries were negatively impacted. In their place, we purchased lower quality
credits, which historically have performed better than BBB and BB bonds in a
rising interest rate environment. In terms of issuer size, we generally focus on
larger companies because of their financial flexibility, ability to withstand
less-favorable financial markets and superior access to capital markets.

As we have stated, we believe the fundamentals of the high yield market remain
positive, with favorable earnings, lower default rates and modestly tightening
high yield credit spreads. Many of these positive factors have already been
"priced into" the market during the past two years, however, and high yield
seems to us to be fairly valued. We believe that in 2005, high yield returns
should be driven primarily by coupon income rather than price appreciation. We
look for the trust's holdings to earn their coupon in the coming months and are
hopeful that market fundamentals will remain favorable through the end of 2005.

There is no guarantee that any securities will continue to perform well or be
held by the trust in the future.

(c)As required, effective January 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
   the period ended December 31, 2001 was to decrease net investment income per
   share by $.02, increase net realized and unrealized gains and losses per
   share by $.02 and decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net
   assets applicable to common shares by .40%. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for periods prior to December 31, 2001 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2004

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Securities which are not valued by independent pricing
services or dealers are valued at fair value using procedures established in
good faith by the Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At December 31, 2004, the Trust had no when-issued and
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other

 20

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2004 continued

income is comprised primarily of consent fees. Consent fees are earned as
compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of debt instruments.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2004, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $26,614,115 which will expire according to the
following table:

<Table>
<Caption>

</Table>

    At December 31, 2004, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually to common shareholders. Distributions from net
realized gains for book purposes may include short-term capital gains which are
included in ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003 were as follows:

<Table>

                                                                 2004          2003
<S>                                                           <C>           <C>
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income...........................................  $4,011,590    $3,889,082
  Return of capital.........................................          --       101,822
                                                              ----------    ----------
                                                              $4,011,590    $3,990,904
                                                              ==========    ==========
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting for the 2004 fiscal year have been
identified and appropriately reclassified. Permanent

                                                                              21
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2004 continued

differences of $216,540 relating to book to tax amortization differences were
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized loss and permanent differences of $87,760 relating to fee income
received from tender offers were reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to accumulated net realized loss. Also, a permanent book and
tax difference relating to the true-up of prior year adjustments totaling $2,171
was reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to
accumulated net realized loss in the amount of $1,890 and capital in the amount
of $281.

    As of December 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $332,847
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets of the Trust.

    For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $3,900 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the year ended December
31, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $24,300 representing
Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen") cost
of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which are reported as
part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, in the Statement of
Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments were $53,450,774 and $53,375,108, respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2004 continued

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

As of December 31, 2004, the Trust has outstanding 1,112 Auction Preferred
Shares ("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is currently
reset every 28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on December
31, 2004 was 2.308%. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the rates ranged
from 1.068% to 2.308%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of Preferred Share Maintenance
expense.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

5. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              23

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen High Income Trust II

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of December 31, 2004, the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits. The Fund's financial highlights for the periods ended prior
to December 31, 2000, were audited by other auditors whose report, dated
February 10, 2000, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2004, by
correspondence with the Trust's custodian. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II as of December 31, 2004, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. All Common Shareholders are deemed to be participants in the Plan unless
they specifically elect not to participate. Common Shareholders who elect not to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions of dividends and capital
gains in cash paid by check mailed directly to the Common Shareholder by the
Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                                                                              25

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    All Common Shareholders of the Trust are deemed to be participants in the
Plan unless they specifically elect not to participate. You may withdraw from
the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by writing State Street Bank
and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any fractional
Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:

Item 2.  Code of Ethics.

(a)      The Trust has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Trust or
a third party.

(b)      No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c)      The Trust has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by
the shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund.":

"Each Covered Officer must not use his personal influence or personal
relationship improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
indirectly)."

Further, due to personnel changes at the Adviser, the list of Covered Officers
set forth in Exhibit B and the General Counsel designee to whom questions about
the application of the Code should be referred in Exhibit C were amended during
the period. Exhibit B was then amended again in February 2005. Both editions of
Exhibit B are attached.

(d)      Not applicable.

(e)      Not applicable.

(f)
         (1)      The Trust's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit 11A.
         (2)      Not applicable.
         (3)      Not applicable.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has two "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Trustees : Jerry Choate and R. Craig Kennedy. Under applicable
securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit committee financial
expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose, including without
limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a
result of being designated or identified as an audit committee financial expert.
The designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial
expert does not impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liabilities
that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on such
person as a member of the audit committee and Board of Trustees in the absence
of such designation or identification.

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

               AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of
pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different
period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and
pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent Auditors
without obtaining specific pre-approval

- ----------
(1)      This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
        Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above,
         supercedes and replaces all prior versions that may have been amended
         from time to time.
(2)      Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have
         the meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>


from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.


2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.


3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix
B.1. All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).


4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.


<PAGE>

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in
Appendix B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the
Audit Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).


5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large
and complex transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be
provided by the Independent Auditors to any executive officer or
trustee/director/managing general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual
capacity, where such services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable
only to internally managed investment companies).


6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

         A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.


7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.


9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.


10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:


         -        Van Kampen Investments Inc.

6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f)      Not applicable.

(g)      See table above.

(h)      The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:

I.       POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policies and
procedures for voting proxies with respect to securities held in the accounts of
clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary Investment
Management services and for which a MSIM entity has the authority to vote their
proxies. The policies and procedures and general guidelines in this section will
be reviewed and, as necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised
proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by these policies and procedures
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, L.P., Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Company, Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Investments LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., Van Kampen Asset Management Inc., and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each a "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will vote proxies as part of its authority to manage,
acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the MSIM registered
management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and Advisor
Funds)(collectively referred to as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM Fund will vote
proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable investment advisory
agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as authorized by its Board of
Directors or Trustees. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named
fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the
case of an account not governed by ERISA, the Investment Management Agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which we manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term
investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or
its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a statement of proxy voting
policy. In these

<PAGE>


situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's policy unless to do
so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations or the MSIM
Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - To assist the MSIM Affiliates in their responsibility
for voting proxies and the overall global proxy voting process, Institutional
Shareholder Services ("ISS") and the Investor Responsibility Research Center
("IRRC") have been retained as experts in the proxy voting and corporate
governance area. ISS and IRRC are independent advisers that specialize in
providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional
investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
institutional investors. The services provided to MSIM Affiliates include
in-depth research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. In
addition to research, ISS provides vote execution, reporting, and recordkeeping.
MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A. below) will carefully monitor
and supervise the services provided by the proxy research services.

Voting Proxies for certain Non-US Companies - While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States and other developed markets with a number
of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting proxies
of non-US companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly emerging
markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent a MSIM
Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are not
limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other
than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings;
(iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction
of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person,
(v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate the MSIM Affiliate's voting
instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies will be voted on a best
efforts basis only, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been
retained to provide assistance to the MSIM Affiliates in connection with voting
their clients' non-US proxies.

II.      GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, including the guidelines set forth below. These
guidelines address a broad range of issues, including board size and
composition, executive compensation, anti-takeover proposals, capital structure
proposals and social responsibility issues and are meant to be general voting
parameters on issues that arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however,
may vote in a manner that is contrary to the following general guidelines,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section IV. below, provided the vote is
consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

                  subject to the review and approval of the Proxy Review

                  management support), subject to the review and approval of the
                  Proxy Review Committee, as appropriate.

                  -        Capitalization changes that add classes of stock

                  Review Committee.

                  Corporate Transactions

                  -        Mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate

                           basis. In all cases, ISS and IRRC research and
                           analysis will be used along with MSIM Affiliates'
                           research and analysis, based on, among other things,
                           MSIM internal company-specific knowledge.

                           compensation plans, employment contracts, and
                           severance agreements that benefit management and
                           would be costly to shareholders if triggered.

<PAGE>

                  -        Shareholders rights plans that allow appropriate
                           offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or

                           from proceeding.

                           (i)      Whether the stock option plan is incentive
                                    based;

                           (ii)     For mature companies, should be no more than
                                    5% of the issued capital at the time of
                                    approval;

                           (iii)    For growth companies, should be no more than
                                    10% of the issued capital at the time of
                                    approval.

                  Anti-Takeover Provisions

                  -        Proposals requiring shareholder ratification of
                           poison pills.

                  -        Anti-takeover and related provisions that serve to
                           prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                           their rights or effectively deter the appropriate
                           tender offers and other offers.

B.       SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

         1.    The following shareholder proposals are generally supported,
                  subject to the review and approval of the Proxy Review

IV.       ADMINISTRATION OF PROXY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A.       PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

         1.       The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible
                  for creating and implementing MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
                  Procedures and, in this regard, has expressly adopted them.
                  Following are some of the functions and responsibilities of
                  the Committee.

                  (a)      The Committee, which will consist of members
                           designated by MSIM's Chief Investment Officer, is
                           responsible for establishing MSIM's proxy voting
                           policies and guidelines and determining how MSIM will
                           vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

                  (b)      The Committee will periodically review and have the
                           authority to amend as necessary MSIM's proxy voting
                           policies and guidelines (as expressed in these Proxy
                           Voting Policy and Procedures) and establish and
                           direct voting positions consistent with the Client
                           Proxy Standard.

                  (c)      The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among
                           other matters): (1) address any outstanding issues
                           relating to MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
                           Procedures; and (2) generally review proposals at
                           upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM portfolio
                           companies in accordance with this Policy and
                           Procedures including, as appropriate, the voting
                           results of prior shareholder meetings of the same
                           issuer where a similar proposal was presented to
                           shareholders. The Committee, or its designee, will
                           timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy
                           and Procedures (and any amendments to them and/or any
                           additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

                  (d)      The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among
                           other matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e.,
                           allowing certain shares of the same issuer that are
                           the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held
                           by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
                           differently than other shares) and/or "override
                           voting"

<PAGE>

                           (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner
                           contrary to the Procedures); (2) review and approve
                           upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters for which
                           specific direction has been provided in Sections I,
                           II, and III above; and (3) determine how to vote
                           matters for which specific direction has not been
                           provided in Sections I, II and III above. Split votes
                           will generally not be approved within a single Global
                           Investor Group team. The Committee may take into
                           account ISS recommendations and the research provided
                           by IRRC as well as any other relevant information
                           they may request or receive.

                  (e)      In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                           Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                           material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                           appearance of a potential material conflict of
                           interest, the Committee will designate a special
                           committee to review, and recommend a course of action
                           with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                           ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee may
                           request the assistance of the Law and Compliance
                           Departments and will have sole discretion to cast a
                           vote. In addition to the research provided by ISS and
                           IRRC, the Special Committee may request analysis from
                           MSIM Affiliate investment professionals and outside
                           sources to the extent it deems appropriate.

                  (f)      The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will document in writing all of their
                           decisions and actions, which documentation will be
                           maintained by the Committee and the Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s) for a period of at
                           least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate
                           to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                           investment company, the Committee and Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
                           decisions to each applicable Board of
                           Trustees/Directors of those investment companies at
                           each Board's next regularly Scheduled Board meeting.
                           The report will contain information concerning
                           decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee
                           during the most recently ended calendar quarter
                           immediately preceding the Board meeting.

The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s), will timely
communicate to applicable PMs, the Compliance Departments and, as necessary to
ISS, decisions of the Committee and Special Committee so that, among other
things, ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
              ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003, AS AMENDED SEPTEMBER 22, 2004



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         -        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         -        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         -        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         -        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         -        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment

<PAGE>

Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to
have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         -        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly);

         -        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         -        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         -        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         -        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;

         -        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         -        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         -        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;


<PAGE>

         -        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         -        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         -        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         -        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         -        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         -        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         -        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         -        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         -        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         -        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         -        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a

- ----------
(3)      Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the
         registrant of a material departure from a provision of the code of
         ethics."

<PAGE>
                  recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         -        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         -        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or
C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

         Trust II;

2.       Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
         such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
         information included in this report, fairly present in all material

         include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
         establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as

         internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         a)       designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

         b)       designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                  caused such internal control over financial reporting to be

                  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

         d)       disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the
                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                  to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         a)       all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

         b)       any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
