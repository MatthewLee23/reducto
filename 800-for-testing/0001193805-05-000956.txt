MuniVest Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net
asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments,
net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the
form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the
per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to
benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped;
that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At the same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common Stock shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks
of leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. As of February 28, 2005, the percentage of the
Fund's total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 11.36%, before the
deduction of Preferred Stock.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may also invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter
contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the
change in market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return
for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change
in market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or
taking physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the
party with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will default on its
obligation to pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet
its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.

</TABLE>

The U.S. economy has continued to show resilience in the face of the Federal
Reserve Board's (the Fed) continued interest rate hikes and, more recently,
higher oil prices. The Fed's measured tightening program recently brought the
federal funds rate to 2.75% en route to a more "neutral" short-term interest
rate target (relative to inflation). Since the U.S. presidential election,
progress has been monitored on many fronts in Washington, although concerns
remain about the structural problems of debt and deficits, as reflected by a
significant decline in the U.S. dollar.

U.S. equities ended 2004 in a strong rally, but remained in a fairly narrow
trading range for the first two months of 2005. Divergences were notable among
sectors, with energy emerging as a clear leader. On the positive side,
corporations have accelerated their hiring plans, capital spending remains
reasonably robust and merger-and-acquisition activity has increased. Offsetting
the positives are slowing corporate earnings growth, renewed energy price
concerns and the potential for an economic slowdown. International equities,
particularly in Asia, have benefited from higher economic growth rates (China
recorded growth of 9.3% in 2004), stronger currencies and relatively reasonable
valuations.

The major action in the bond market has been a flattening of the yield curve. As
short-term interest rates continued to rise, yields on the long end of the curve
remained relatively stable -- even declining at certain points since the Fed's
monetary tightening program began in June 2004. This phenomenon has been largely
attributed to continued foreign interest in U.S. bonds, which has served to
absorb much of the excess supply. By period-end, many believed long-term yields
were long overdue for a rise.

Looking ahead, the environment is likely to be a challenging one for investors,
with diversification and selectivity becoming increasingly important themes.
With this in mind, we encourage you to meet with your financial advisor to
review your goals and asset allocation and to rebalance your portfolio, as
necessary, to ensure it remains aligned with your objectives and risk tolerance.
As always, we thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your
investment assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years
ahead.

                                                Sincerely,


                                                /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      Fund performance exceeded its comparable Lipper category average for the
period, benefiting from a focus on lower-rated, higher-yielding securities -- an
area of the municipal market that continued to outperform.

Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Despite broadly positive economic conditions, long-term bond yields declined
during the past six months as bond prices, which move opposite yields, generally
rose. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth was recently revised to 3.8% for the
fourth quarter of 2004, similar to the 4% rate recorded in the third quarter.
For 2004 as a whole, real GDP grew at a 4.4% rate, well ahead of 2003's annual
rate of 3%. The improving economic activity was largely offset by inflationary
trends remaining in the 1.5% - 2% range. Also helping to boost bond prices was
strong currency-related demand for long-term U.S. Treasury issues on the part of
many foreign governments.

Over the past six months, long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields declined 21 basis
points (.21%) to 4.72% at February 28, 2005. However, the Federal Reserve Board
(the Fed) continued to raise short-term interest rates, moving its federal funds
target rate recently to 2.75%. The Fed's series of interest rate hikes, and the
expectation for a continuation of the monetary tightening program, pressured
shorter-maturity bond yields higher throughout the period. The yield on the
10-year Treasury note stood at 4.36% at the end of February, an increase of 26
basis points over the six-month period.

A generally positive technical environment supported higher bond prices in the
long end of the municipal bond market. Recent bond issuance has been heavily
weighted in the 10-year - 20-year maturity range, leading to a moderate scarcity
of bonds maturing in 30 years - 35 years. Investor demand was solid throughout
the period and increased in the latter months. The most current statistics from
the Investment Company Institute indicate that long-term municipal bond funds
saw net new cash flows of $870 million in January 2005. This represented a
considerable improvement from January 2004, which experienced net cash outflows
of $224 million. As measured by the Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, the yield on
A-rated revenue bonds maturing in 30 years declined 16 basis points to 4.93% at
the end of February. AAA-rated issues maturing in 30 years, as reported by
Municipal Market Data, declined 19 basis points to 4.51%. Conversely,
shorter-maturity municipal bond yields increased, responding to rising U.S.
Treasury note yields and increased supply pressures. AAA-rated tax-exempt bonds
maturing in 10 years yielded 3.65% at the end of February, representing an
increase of 15 basis points over the period.

During the past six months, more than $175 billion in new long-term tax-exempt
bonds was underwritten, essentially unchanged versus the same period a year ago.
In the last three months, the pace of new issuance increased. Approximately $91
billion in long-term tax-exempt bonds was issued during that time, an increase
of 12% compared to the same three months a year ago. New-issue municipal volume
is expected to be easily manageable in early 2005, continuing to support the
tax-exempt market's favorable technical position.

Finally, long-term tax-exempt bond yield ratios have remained in the 88% - 95%
range relative to taxable bonds, at or above their recent historic average of
85% - 88%. These attractive yield ratios should continue to attract both
traditional and non-traditional investors to the municipal market.

How did the Fund perform during the period in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2005, the Common Stock of MuniVest
Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 6.72% and 7.09%, based on a period-end
per share net asset value of $10.09 and a per share market price of $9.55,
respectively, and $.336 per share income dividends. Over the same period, the
total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +5.46%, based on a change
in per share net asset value from $9.91 to $10.09, and assuming reinvestment of
all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the +4.96% average
return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for the
six-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in municipal
debt issues rated in the top four credit-rating categories. These funds can be
leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse repurchase
agreements.) The Fund was able to achieve the outperformance despite its modest
defensive positioning during a period when long-term tax-exempt bond yields
declined slightly. Benefiting performance over the past six months was the
Fund's above-average yield and the continued outperformance of our lower-rated
holdings, such as A-rated hospital or corporate-backed debt.

<PAGE>

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the American Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Along with a rise in long-term municipal bond prices, we have seen increased
demand for higher-yielding tax-exempt securities. In recent months, much of the
new net cash flows into municipal bond funds has been directed into "high yield"
tax-exempt funds. The demand in this area of the market has helped generate
significant price appreciation for the Fund's lower-rated issues. We will be
monitoring the price improvement of these lower-rated issues. Should it continue
and/or intensify, we would look to reduce some of the Fund's exposure to
lower-rated issues. Higher-quality securities could then be purchased at
historically attractive yield differentials.

During the period, we also took advantage of the continued appreciation in
California state-related issues. Overall exposure to these bonds was reduced by
approximately 2.5%, allowing the Fund to benefit from the recent price
improvements. The proceeds from the sales were largely invested in New Jersey
securities, where we found an attractive buying opportunity as supply increased
and prices fell. Specifically, a number of large New Jersey issues were marketed
in early October 2004, resulting in a temporary increase in New Jersey municipal
bond yields.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2005, the Fund's Auction Market
Preferred Stock (AMPS) had average yields as follows: Series A, 1.38%; Series B,
1.60%; Series C, 1.71%; Series D, 1.36%; Series E, 1.53%; and Series F, 1.60%.
Continued short-term interest rate increases by the Fed have modestly boosted
the Fund's borrowing costs throughout the past six months. While we believe the
majority of the Fed's monetary tightening actions have already occurred, we
expect additional increases in the federal funds rate until at least midyear.
Despite Despite the recent rate hikes, the Fund's borrowing costs remain quite
low on a historical basis and the leveraging of the Preferred Stock has
continued to generate a material income benefit to the Fund's Common Stock
shareholders. However, should the spread between short-term and long-term
interest rates narrow, the benefits of leverage will decline and, as a result,
reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. At the end of the period, the
Fund's leverage amount, due to AMPS, was 35.04% of total net assets. (For a more
complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 2 of this
report to shareholders.)

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

The Fund ended the period with a defensive posture, and we expect to maintain
that structure in the coming months. Rising short-term interest rates, an
expanding domestic economy, and increasing commodity prices (especially oil) are
all textbook indicators for rising long-term interest rates.

Nevertheless, bond yields are still near their historic lows and, under the
circumstances, we believe the more prudent strategy is to maintain our emphasis
on higher-yielding issues rather than more interest rate-sensitive securities.
The Fund also will remain fully invested in order to enhance shareholder income.
Given the municipal bond market's strong technical position, including favorable
supply/demand dynamics, we expect the tax-exempt market to perform well relative
to its taxable counterpart.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the
results for the interim period. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on
the American Stock Exchange under the symbol MVF. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter markets and are valued at the last available bid price in the
over-the-counter market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing
service. Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both
dealer-supplied valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general direction of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are
reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures
contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at
their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or
purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded
options. In the case of options traded in the over-the-counter market, valuation
is the last asked price (options written) or the last bid price (options
purchased). Swap agreements are valued by quoted fair values received daily by
the Fund's pricing service. Short-term investments with a remaining maturity of
60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value,
under which method the investment is valued at cost and any premium or discount
is amortized on a straight line basis to maturity. Investments in open-end
investment companies are valued at their net asset value each business day.
Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
      Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund
      is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the
      liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market
      value of the option written. When a security is purchased or sold through
      an exercise of an option, the related premium paid (or received) is added
      to (or deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
      (or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires
      (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain
      or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or
      gain or loss to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the
      premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co. ("ML &
Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at
an annual rate of .50% of the Fund's average daily net assets, including assets
acquired from the sale of Preferred Stock. The Investment Adviser has agreed to
waive its management fee by the amount of management fees the Fund pays to FAM
indirectly through its investment in the Merrill Lynch Institutional Tax-Exempt
Fund. For the six months ended February 28, 2005, FAM reimbursed the Fund in the
amount of $13,941.

For the six months ended February 28, 2005, the Fund reimbursed FAM $9,886 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, PSI, and/or ML & Co.

Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which
comprises part of the financial information included in this report.

MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level of
current income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which is exempt from federal income taxes in the opinion of bond counsel to
the issuer.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to the
shareholders of MuniVest Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase of
shares of the Fund or any securities mentioned in the report. Past performance
results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. The Fund has leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Statements and other information herein
are as dated and are subject to change.

                  the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
                  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                  materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

      5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
            the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
            registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
            equivalent functions):

            a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

            b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
