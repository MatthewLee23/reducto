(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect broker commissions
or sales charges. Total return for a period of less than one year is not
annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at November 30, 2003.

PIMCO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
November 30, 2003

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Corporate Opportunity Fund (the "Fund"), was organized as a Massachusetts
business trust on September 13, 2002. Prior to commencing operations on December
27, 2002, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 6,981 shares of
beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,003 to Allianz
Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PIMCO Advisors Fund
Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"), serves as the Fund's Investment
Manager and is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an unlimited amount of
$0.0001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund seeks to maximize total return through a combination of current income
and capital appreciation in a diversified portfolio of U.S. dollar denominated
corporate debt obligations of varying maturities and other income producing
securities.

The Fund issued 55,500,000 shares of common stock, in its initial public
offering. An additional 7,730,000 shares were issued in connection with the
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. These shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.675 per share.
Common offering costs of $1,541,506 (representing $0.024 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment Manager agreed to pay all offering costs (other
than the sales load) and organizational expenses exceeding $0.03 per share.
Since aggregate offering costs and organizational expenses were less than $0.03
per common share, organizational expenses of $15,000 were expensed in the
current period. In addition, the underwriters' commission and offering costs
associated with the issuance of Preferred Shares in the amounts of $5,650,000
and $554,930, respectively, have been charged to paid-in capital in excess of
par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily available are stated at market value. Debt securities are valued
daily by an independent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees.
Prices may be obtained from independent pricing services which use information
provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data
relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. The value of
the Fund's investments is determined at the close of regular trading (normally,
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on each day the
NYSE is open or if no sales are reported, as is the case for most securities
traded over-the-counter, the mean between representative bid and asked
quotations obtained from a quotation reporting system or from established market
makers. Fixed income securities, including those to be purchased under firm
commitment agreements, are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from
brokers and dealers or pricing services. Short-term investments maturing in 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
Certain fixed income securities for which daily market quotations are not
readily available may be valued, pursuant to guidelines established by the Board
of Trustees, with reference to fixed income securities whose prices are more
readily obtainable. The prices used by the Fund to value securities may differ
from the value that would be realized if the securities were sold.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Securities
purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a
month or more after trade date. Realized gains and losses on investments are
determined on the identified cost basis. Interest income is recorded on an
accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities purchased are accreted
or amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities
using the effective interest method.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the
other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of its ordinary income and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar
year the Fund intends not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax. Under

                                       13
<Page>

certain circumstances, however, the Fund may determine to retain a portion of
its taxable income, if such retention is deemed to be in the interest of the
Fund and its shareholders. In such a circumstance, the Fund may be subject to a
4% excise tax.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Fund declares dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net
investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either considered
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current
and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(e) CREDIT DEFAULT/INTEREST RATE SWAPS
The Fund enters into interest rate and credit default swap contracts ("swaps")
for investment purposes, to manage its interest rate and credit risk or to add
leverage.

As a seller in the credit default swap contract, the Fund would be required to
pay the par or other agreed-upon value of a referenced debt obligation to the
counterparty in the event of a default by a third party, such as a U.S. or
foreign corporate issuer, on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund
would receive from the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term
of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default
occurs, the Fund would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment
obligations. Such periodic payments are accrued daily and recorded as interest
income.

The Fund may also purchase credit default swap contracts in order to hedge
against the risk of default of debt securities held, in which case the Fund
would function as the counterparty referenced in the preceding paragraph. As a
purchaser of a credit default swap contract, the Fund would receive the par or
other agreed upon value of a referenced debt obligation from the counterparty in
the event of default by a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate
issuer on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund would make
periodic payments to the counterparty over the term of the contract provided no
event of default has occurred. Such periodic payments are accrued daily and
charged to interest income.

Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange by the Fund with a
counterparty of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g.,
an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a
notional amount of principal. Net payments of interest on interest rate swap
agreements are recorded daily as interest income.

Swaps are marked to market daily by the Fund's Investment Manager based upon
quotations from market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Fund's Statement of Operations.
Payments received or made, if any, upon termination or maturity of the interest
rate swaps, net of any basis in the interest rate swaps, is recorded as a
realized gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. For a credit default swap
sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount made by the Fund in the
event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of
the referenced debt obligation purchased/received. For a credit default swap
purchased by the Fund, the agreed upon amount received by the Fund in the event
of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as proceeds from
sale/delivery of the referenced debt obligation and the resulting gain or loss
realized on the referenced debt obligation is recorded as such by the Fund.

Entering into swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and
documentation risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no
liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may
default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the
contractual terms in the agreements, and that there may be unfavorable changes
in net interest rates.

(f) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund may enter into transactions with its custodian bank or securities
brokerage firms approved by the Board of Trustees whereby it purchases
securities under agreements to resell at an agreed upon price and date
("repurchase agreements"). Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in
the financial statements. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which
consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset backed securities,
are held by

                                       14
<Page>

the custodian bank until maturity of the repurchase agreement. Provisions of the
repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Fund require that the
market value of the collateral, including accrued interest thereon, is
sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the counterparty
defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if the counterparty enters
an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be
delayed or limited.

(g) FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS
The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for the purpose of
hedging against foreign currency risk arising from the investment or anticipated
investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund may also
enter into these contracts for purposes of increasing exposure to a foreign
currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country
to another. A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two
parties to buy and sell a currency at a set exchange rate on a future date. The
market value of a forward foreign currency contract fluctuates with changes in
forward currency exchange rates. All commitments are marked to market daily at
the applicable exchange rates and any resulting unrealized gains and losses are
recorded. Realized gains or losses are recorded at the time the forward contract
matures or by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering these
contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign
currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

(h) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
For hedging purposes, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) put and call
options. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a
premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the
risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not
perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in
the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired through
the exercise of call options is increased by the premiums paid. The proceeds
from the securities sold through the exercise of put options is decreased by the
premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an written
option could result in the Fund purchasing a security at a price different from
the current market.

(i) LOAN PARTICIPATIONS
The Fund may invest in loan participations. When the Fund purchases a loan
participation, the Fund typically enters into a contractual relationship with
the lender or third party selling such participations ("Selling Participant"),
but not the borrower. As a result, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the
borrower, the Selling Participant and any other persons interpositioned between
the Fund and the borrower. The Fund may not directly benefit from the collateral
supporting the senior loan in which it has purchased the loan participation.

(j) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Fund is required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Fund as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value at the
time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded is
simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves the risk of

                                       15
<Page>

an imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets, and the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(k) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES
Credit-linked trust certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other vehicle formed under state law which, in turn, invests in a basket of
derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and
other securities, in order to provide exposure to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Like an investment in a bond, investments in these credit-linked trust
certificates represent the right to receive periodic income payments (in the
form of distributions) and payment of principal at the end of the term of the
certificate. However, these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential obligations to, the counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(l) WHEN-ISSUED/DELAYED-DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS
The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued or delayed-delivery
basis. These transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell securities
for a predetermined price or yield, with payment and delivery taking place
beyond the customary settlement period. When delayed-delivery purchases are
outstanding, the Fund will set aside and maintain until the settlement date in a
designated account, liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase
price. When purchasing a security on a delayed-delivery basis, the Fund assumes
the rights and risks of ownership of the security, including the risk of price
and yield fluctuations, and takes such fluctuations into account when
determining its net asset value. The Fund may dispose of or renegotiate a
delayed-delivery transaction after it is entered into, and may sell when-issued
securities before they are delivered, which may result in a realized gain or
loss. When the Fund sells a security on a delayed-delivery basis, the Fund does
not participate in future gains and losses with respect to the security.

(m) REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements in order to add leverage to
the Fund's portfolio. In a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells
securities to a bank or broker-dealer and agrees to repurchase the securities at
a mutually agreed upon date and price. Generally, the effect of such a
transaction is that the Fund can recover and reinvest all or most of the cash
invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse
repurchase agreement and still be entitled to the returns associated with those
portfolio securities. Such transactions are advantageous if the interest cost to
the Fund of the reverse repurchase transaction is less than the return it
obtains on investments purchased with the cash. Unless the Fund covers its
positions in reverse repurchase agreements (by segregating liquid assets at
least equal in amount to the forward purchase commitment), its obligations under
the agreements will be subject to the Fund's limitations on borrowings. Reverse
repurchase agreements involve leverage risk and also the risk that the market
value of the securities that the Fund is obligated to repurchase under the
agreement may decline below the repurchase price. In the event the buyer of
securities under a reverse repurchase agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes
insolvent, the Fund's use of the proceeds of the agreement may be restricted
pending a determination by the other party, or its trustee or receiver, whether
to enforce the Fund's obligation to repurchase the securities.

(n) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES
The Fund benefits from an expense offset arrangement with its custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing securities,
they would have generated income for the Fund.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager of the Fund. Subject
to the supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees, the Investment Manager is
responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's business affairs and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investment Manager will
receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.60% of the Fund's
average daily net assets (inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding.)

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment Management
Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), to manage the Fund's investments. Subject to
the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all

                                       16
<Page>

investment decisions with respect to the Fund's assets. The Investment Manager
(not the Fund) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in
return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.39% of the Fund's
average daily net assets (inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding) for the period from commencement of operations
through December 31, 2007 and at the maximum annual rate of 0.55% of average
daily net assets (inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred shares
that may be outstanding) thereafter while the Agreement remains in effect,
provided that the fee will be reduced to 0.325% during the first five years of
operations and 0.45% thereafter while the Agreement remains in effect. The
Investment Manager informed the Fund that it paid the Sub-Adviser $5,304,040 in
connection with its sub-advisory services for the period ended November 30,
2003.

3. INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES
For the period ended November 30, 2003, purchases and sales of investments,
other than short-term securities, were $1,811,927,909 and $357,716,014,
respectively.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

PIMCO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FUND REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF
PIMCO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets applicable to common shareholders and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
PIMCO Corporate Opportunity Fund (the "Fund") at November 30, 2003, and the
results of its operations, the changes in its net assets applicable to common
shareholders and the financial highlights for the period December 27, 2002
(commencement of operations) through November 30, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit, which included
confirmation of securities at November 30, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PIMCO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FUND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (UNAUDITED)

Pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all Common
Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
dividends, including any capital gain dividends, reinvested automatically in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders (the
"Plan Agent"), unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. An election to
receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the shareholder. In
the case of record shareholders such as banks, brokers or other nominees that
hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares certified from
time to time by the record shareholder as representing the total amount
registered in such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in
the name of a bank, broker or nominee should contact the bank, broker or nominee
for details. All distributions to investors who elect not to participate in the
Plan (or whose broker or nominee elects not to participate on the investor's
behalf), will be paid cash by check mailed, in the case of direct shareholder,
to the record holder by PFPC Inc., as the Fund's dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee) elect not to participate in the Plan, the
number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1)  If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value on the payment
     date, the Fund will issue new shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
     value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market price
     per Common Share on the payment date; or

(2)  If Common Shares are trading below net asset value (minus estimated
     brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of Common
     Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the Plan Agent will receive
     the dividend or distribution in cash and will purchase Common Shares in the
     open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
     participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for the Common
     Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases.
     Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the Plan Agent may
     exceed the market price on the payment date, resulting in the purchase of
     fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common
     Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
     distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market
     on or shortly after the payment date, but in no event later than the
     ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest will not be paid on
     any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a certificate for
each whole share in your account under the Plan and you will receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan Agent
will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common Shares with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive distributions in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvested dividends and distributions are taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund
reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the
participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from the
Fund's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., P.O.Box 43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027,
telephone number 1-800-331-1710.

PIMCO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FUND TAX & OTHER INFORMATION, PROXY VOTING POLICIES
                                 AND PROCEDURES

TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED):

Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, requires the Fund
to advise shareholders within 60 days of the Fund's tax year-end (November 30,
2003) as to the federal tax status of dividends and distributions received by
shareholders during such tax year. Per share dividends for the tax year ended
November 30, 2003 were as follows:

<Table>
    <S>                                                         <C>
    Dividends to common shareholders from ordinary income       $   1.373
    Dividends to preferred shareholders from ordinary income    $ 233.287
</Table>

Since the Fund's tax year is not the calendar year, another notification will be
sent with respect to calendar year 2003. In January 2004, shareholders will be
advised on IRS Form 1099 DIV as to the federal tax status of the dividends and
distributions received during calendar 2003. The amount that will be reported,
will be the amount to use on your 2003 federal income tax return and may differ
from the amount which must be reported in connection with the Fund's tax year
ended November 30, 2003. Shareholders are advised to consult with their tax
advisers as to the federal, state and local tax status of the income received
from the Fund.

OTHER INFORMATION:

material changes in the Fund's investment objectives or policies; (ii) changes
to the Fund's charter or by-laws; (iii) material changes in the principal risk
factors associated with investment in the Fund; or (iv) change in the persons
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund has adopted to
determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (i)
without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund at (800) 331-1710 (ii) on the

          CODE OF ETHICS PURSUANT TO SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY
        ACT OF 2002 FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

                               SEPTEMBER 16, 2003

I.      COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

        This Code of Ethics (this "Code") pursuant to Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been adopted by the registered investment
companies (each a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") listed on Exhibit A and
applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers" each of whom is
identified in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

        -      honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
               actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
               professional relationships;

        -      full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
               reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the
               Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
               communications made by a Fund;

        -      compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
               regulations;

        -      the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
               appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

        -      accountability for adherence to the Code.

        Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of
interest.

II.     COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ANY ACTUAL OR APPARENT
        CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
relevant Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the relevant Fund.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the relevant Fund and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions

<Page>

and procedures in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including the regulations
thereunder, the "1940 Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (including
the regulations thereunder, the "Investment Advisers Act"). Indeed, conflicts of
interest are endemic for certain registered management investment companies and
those conflicts are both substantially and procedurally dealt with under the
1940 Act. For example, Covered Officers may not engage in certain transactions
with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of such Fund. The
compliance program of each Fund and the compliance programs of its investment
advisers (including sub-advisers), principal underwriter and administrator or
sub-administrator (each a "Service Provider" and, collectively, the "Service
Providers") are reasonably designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of many of those provisions, although they are not designed to
provide absolute assurance as to those matters. This Code does not, and is not
intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts
fall outside of the parameters of this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

        Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Fund and its Service Providers of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether for the Funds or
for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Service Providers
and the Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationships between the Funds and their Service
Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the relevant Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, other
applicable law and the relevant Fund's constitutional documents, such activities
will be deemed to have been handled ethically. Frequently, the 1940 Act
establishes, as a mechanism for dealing with conflicts, disclosure to and
approval by the Directors/Trustees of a Fund who are not "interested persons" of
such Fund under the 1940 Act. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes and that such service, by itself, does not give rise to a conflict of
interest.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not the subject of provisions of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should bear in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the relevant Fund, unless the personal interest has been disclosed
to and approved by other officers of such Fund or such Fund's Board or a
committee of such Fund's Board that has no such personal interest.

                         *         *         *         *

                                        2
<Page>

        Each Covered Officer must not:

        -      use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly
               to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the
               relevant Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
               personally to the detriment of such Fund;

        -      cause the relevant Fund to take action, or fail to take action,
               for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather
               than the benefit such Fund; or

        -      retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of
               the Funds or their Service Providers for reports of potential
               violations that are made in good faith.

        There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the President of the relevant Fund (or, with respect to activities
of the President, by the Chairman of the relevant Fund). These conflict of
interest situations are listed below:

        -      service on the board of directors or governing board of a
               publicly traded entity;

        -      acceptance of any investment opportunity or of any material gift
               or gratuity from any person or entity that does business, or
               desires to do business, with the relevant Fund. For these
               purposes, material gifts do not include (i) gifts from a single
               giver so long as their aggregate annual value does not exceed the
               equivalent of $100.00 or (ii) attending business meals, business
               related conferences, sporting events and other entertainment
               events at the expense of a giver, so long as the expense is
               reasonable and both the Covered Person and the giver are
               present.(1)

        -      any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
               relationship with, any entities doing business with the relevant
               Fund, other than a Service Provider or an affiliate of a Service
               Provider. This restriction shall not apply to or otherwise limit
               the ownership of publicly traded securities so long as the
               Covered Person's ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the
               outstanding securities of the relevant class.

        -      a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
               transaction charges or spreads paid by the relevant Fund for
               effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming
               shares other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
               employment with a Service Provider or its affiliate. This
               restriction shall not apply to or otherwise limit the ownership
               of

- ----------
        (1) The $100.00 threshold was taken from the ADAMA Code of Ethics.

                                        3
<Page>

               publicly traded securities so long as the Covered Person's
               ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the particular class of
               security outstanding.

III.    DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

        -      no Covered Officer should knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
               to misrepresent, facts about the relevant Fund to others, whether
               within or outside such Fund, including to such Fund's Board and
               auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
               organizations;

        -      each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
               area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
               of the Funds and the Service Providers or with counsel to the
               Funds with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
               understandable disclosure in the registration statements or
               periodic reports that the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
               (which, for sake of clarity, does not include any sales
               literature, omitting prospectuses, or "tombstone" advertising
               prepared by the relevant Fund's principal underwriter(s)); and

        -      it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
               compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
               applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.     REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

        Each Covered Officer must:

        -      upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
               becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the relevant
               Fund that he has received, read, and understands the Code;

        -      provide full and fair responses to all questions asked in any
               Trustee and Officer Questionnaire provided by the relevant Fund
               as well as with respect to any supplemental request for
               information; and

        -      notify the President of the relevant Fund promptly if he is
               convinced to a moral certainty that there has been a material
               violation of this Code (with respect to violations by a
               President, the Covered Officer shall report to the Chairman of
               the relevant Fund).

        The President of each Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by the President will be considered by the Chairman
of the relevant Fund.

        The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

                                        4
<Page>

        -      the President will take all appropriate action to investigate any
               potential material violations reported to him, which actions may
               include the use of internal or external counsel, accountants or
               other personnel;

        -      if, after such investigation, the President believes that no
               material violation has occurred, the President is not required to
               take any further action;

        -      any matter that the President believes is a material violation
               will be reported to the Committee;

        -      if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred,
               it will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
               consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
               appropriate modifications to applicable policies and procedures;
               notification to appropriate personnel of a Service Provider or
               its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

        -      the Committee will be authorized to grant waivers, as it deems
               appropriate; and

        -      any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
               required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.      OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers govern or
purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are
subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their Service
Providers's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Service
Providers's more detailed compliance policies and procedures are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.

VI.     AMENDMENTS

        Any material amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit
A, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board.

VII.    CONFIDENTIALITY

        All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone except as permitted by the Board.

                                        5

VIII.   INTERNAL USE

        The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

                                                                    EXHIBIT-99.B

                    PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

The following are general proxy voting policies and procedures ("Policies and
Procedures") adopted by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), an
investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended ("Advisers Act").(1) PIMCO serves as the investment adviser to a wide
range of domestic and international clients, including investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and
separate investment accounts for other clients.(2) These Policies and Procedures
are adopted to ensure compliance with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act,
other applicable fiduciary obligations of PIMCO and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and
interpretations of its staff. In addition to SEC requirements governing
advisers, PIMCO's Policies and Procedures reflect the long-standing fiduciary
standards and responsibilities applicable to investment advisers with respect to
accounts subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA"), as set forth in the Department of Labor's rules and regulations.(3)

PIMCO will implement these Policies and Procedures for each of its respective
clients as required under applicable law, unless expressly directed by a client
in writing to refrain from voting that client's proxies. PIMCO's authority to
vote proxies on behalf of its clients is established by its advisory contracts,
comparable documents or by an overall delegation of discretionary authority over
its client's assets. Recognizing that proxy voting is a rare event in the realm
of fixed income investing and is typically limited to solicitation of consent to
changes in features of debt securities, these Policies and Procedures also apply
to any voting rights and/or consent rights of PIMCO, on behalf of its clients,
with respect to debt securities, including but not limited to, plans of
reorganization, and waivers and consents under applicable indentures.(4)

- ----------
(1)  These Policies and Procedures are adopted by PIMCO pursuant to Rule
     206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act, effective August 6, 2003. SEE PROXY VOTING
     BY INVESTMENT ADVISERS, IA Release No. 2106 (January 31, 2003).

(2)  These Policies and Procedures address proxy voting considerations under
     U.S. law and regulations and do not address the laws or requirements of
     other jurisdictions.

(3)  Department of Labor Bulletin 94-2, 29 C.F.R. 2509.94-2 (July 29, 1994). If
     a client is subject to ERISA, PIMCO will be responsible for voting proxies
     with respect to the client's account, unless the client has expressly
     retained the right and obligation to vote the proxies, and provided prior
     written notice to PIMCO of this retention.

(4)  For purposes of these Policies and Procedures, proxy voting includes any
     voting rights, consent rights or other voting authority of PIMCO on behalf
     of its clients.

<Page>

Set forth below are PIMCO's Policies and Procedures with respect to any voting
or consent rights of advisory clients over which PIMCO has discretionary voting
authority. These Policies and Procedures may be revised from time to time.

GENERAL STATEMENTS OF POLICY

These Policies and Procedures are designed and implemented in a manner
reasonably expected to ensure that voting and consent rights are exercised in
the best interests of PIMCO's clients. Each proxy is voted on a case-by-case
basis taking into consideration any relevant contractual obligations as well as
other relevant facts and circumstances.

PIMCO may abstain from voting a client proxy under the following circumstances:
(1) when the economic effect on shareholders' interests or the value of the
portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant; or (2) when the cost of
voting the proxies outweighs the benefits.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

PIMCO seeks to resolve any material conflicts of interest by voting in good
faith in the best interest of its clients. If a material conflict of interest
should arise, PIMCO will seek to resolve such conflict in the client's best
interest by pursuing any one of the following courses of action:

     1.   convening an ad-hoc committee to assess and resolve the conflict;(5)

     2.   voting in accordance with the instructions/consent of a client after
          providing notice of and disclosing the conflict to that client;

     3.   voting the proxy in accordance with the recommendation of an
          independent third-party service provider;

     4.   suggesting that the client engage another party to determine how the
          proxies should be voted;

     5.   delegating the vote to an independent third-party service provider; or

     6.   voting in accordance with the factors discussed in these Policies and
          Procedures.

PIMCO will document the process of resolving any identified material conflict of
interest.


- ----------
(5)  Any committee must be comprised of personnel who have no direct interest in
     the outcome of the potential conflict.

                                        2

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY VOTING RECORDS

Except to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise approved by PIMCO,
PIMCO will not disclose to third parties how it voted a proxy on behalf of a
client. However, upon request from an appropriately authorized individual, PIMCO
will disclose to its clients or the entity delegating the voting authority to
PIMCO for such clients (E.G., trustees or consultants retained by the client),
how PIMCO voted such client's proxy. In addition, PIMCO provides its clients
with a copy of these Policies and Procedures or a concise summary of these
Policies and Procedures: (i) in Part II of Form ADV; (ii) together with a
periodic account statement in a separate mailing; or (iii) any other means as
determined by PIMCO. The summary will state that these Policies and Procedures
are available upon request and will inform clients that information about how
PIMCO voted that client's proxies is available upon request.

PIMCO RECORD KEEPING

PIMCO or its agent maintains proxy voting records as required by Rule 204-2(c)
of the Advisers Act. These records include: (1) a copy of all proxy voting
policies and procedures; (2) proxy statements (or other disclosures accompanying
requests for client consent) received regarding client securities (which may be
satisfied by relying on obtaining a copy of a proxy statement from the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system or a third
party provided that the third party undertakes to provide a copy promptly upon
request); (3) a record of each vote cast by PIMCO on behalf of a client; (4) a
copy of any document created by PIMCO that was material to making a decision on
how to vote proxies on behalf of a client or that memorializes the basis for
that decision; and (5) a copy of each written client request for proxy voting
records and any written response from PIMCO to any (written or oral) client
request for such records. Additionally, PIMCO or its agent maintains any
documentation related to an identified material conflict of interest.

Proxy voting books and records are maintained by PIMCO or its agent in an easily
accessible place for a period of five years from the end of the fiscal year
during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in the
offices of PIMCO or its agent.

REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT

PIMCO's proxy voting procedures are described below. PIMCO's Compliance Group
will provide for the supervision and periodic review, no less than on a
quarterly basis, of its proxy voting activities and the implementation of these
Policies and Procedures.

Because PIMCO has contracted with State Street Investment Manager Solutions, LLC
("IMS West") to perform portfolio accounting, securities processing and
settlement processing on behalf of PIMCO, certain of the following procedures
involve IMS West in administering and implementing the proxy voting process. IMS
West will review and monitor the proxy voting process to ensure that proxies are
voted on a timely basis.

                                        3
<Page>

     1.   TRANSMIT PROXY TO PIMCO. IMS West will forward to PIMCO's Middle
Office Group each proxy received from registered owners of record (E.G.,
custodian bank or other third party service providers).

     2.   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. PIMCO's Middle Office Group will review each
proxy to determine whether there may be a material conflict between PIMCO and
its client. As part of this review, the group will determine whether the issuer
of the security or proponent of the proposal is a client of PIMCO, or if a
client has actively solicited PIMCO to support a particular position. If no
conflict exists, this group will forward each proxy to the appropriate portfolio
manager for consideration. However, if a conflict does exist, PIMCO's Middle
Office Group will seek to resolve any such conflict in accordance with these
Policies and Procedures.

     3.   VOTE. The portfolio manager will review the information, will vote the
proxy in accordance with these Policies and Procedures and will return the voted
proxy to PIMCO's Middle Office Group.

     4.   REVIEW. PIMCO's Middle Office Group will review each proxy that was
submitted to and completed by the appropriate portfolio manager. PIMCO's Middle
Office Group will forward the voted proxy back to IMS West with the portfolio
manager's decision as to how it should be voted.

     5.   TRANSMITTAL TO THIRD PARTIES. IMS West will document the portfolio
manager's decision for each proxy received from PIMCO's Middle Office Group in a
format designated by the custodian bank or other third party service provider.
IMS West will maintain a log of all corporate actions, including proxy voting,
which indicates, among other things, the date the notice was received and
verified, PIMCO's response, the date and time the custodian bank or other third
party service provider was notified, the expiration date and any action taken.

     6.   INFORMATION BARRIERS. Certain entities controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with PIMCO ("Affiliates") may be engaged in banking,
investment advisory, broker-dealer and investment banking activities. PIMCO
personnel and PIMCO's agents are prohibited from disclosing information
regarding PIMCO's voting intentions to any Affiliate. Any PIMCO personnel
involved in the proxy voting process who are contacted by an Affiliate regarding
the manner in which PIMCO or its delegate intend to vote on a specific issue
must terminate the contact and notify the Compliance Group immediately.

CATEGORIES OF PROXY VOTING ISSUES

In general, PIMCO reviews and considers corporate governance issues related to
proxy matters and generally supports proposals that foster good corporate
governance practices. PIMCO considers each proposal on a case-by-case basis,
taking into consideration various factors and all relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. PIMCO may vote proxies as recommended by
management on routine matters related to the operation of the issuer and on
matters not expected to have a significant economic impact on the issuer and/or
shareholders, because PIMCO believes the recommendations by the issuer generally
are in shareholders' best

                                        4
<Page>

interests, and therefore in the best economic interest of PIMCO's clients. The
following is a non-exhaustive list of issues that may be included in proxy
materials submitted to clients of PIMCO, and a non-exhaustive list of factors
that PIMCO may consider in determining how to vote the client's proxies.

following factors when voting on proposals requiring that the positions of
chairman of the board and the chief executive officer not be filled by the same

ability to review and oversee management's actions; and (ii) any potential
effect on the issuer's productivity and efficiency.

     5.   D&O INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY PROTECTION. PIMCO may consider the
following factors when voting on proposals that include director and officer
indemnification and liability protection: (i) indemnifying directors for conduct
in the normal course of business; (ii) limiting liability for monetary damages
for violating the duty of care; (iii) expanding coverage beyond legal expenses
to acts that represent more serious violations of fiduciary obligation than
carelessness (E.G. negligence); and (iv) providing expanded coverage in cases
where a director's legal defense was unsuccessful if the director was found to
have acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed was
in the best interests of the company.

     6.   STOCK OWNERSHIP. PIMCO may consider the following factors when voting
on proposals on mandatory share ownership requirements for directors: (i) the
benefits of additional vested interest in the issuer's stock; (ii) the ability

relevant factors, including but not limited to limiting the ability of

significant business combination that would require a level of voting approval
in excess of a simple majority.

currently in place; (iii) voting rights of the stock; and (iv) overall
capitalization structure of the issuer.

     2.   ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK. PIMCO may consider the following factors
when voting on the issuance of preferred stock: (i) whether the new class of
preferred stock has unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and
other rights; (ii) whether the issuer expressly states that the stock will not
be used as a takeover defense or carry superior voting rights; (iii) whether the
issuer specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such
stock and the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable; and (iv) whether
the stated purpose is to raise capital or make acquisitions in the normal course
of business.

stock splits: (i) the percentage increase in the number of shares with respect

voting on proposals to opt out of a state takeover statute: (i) the power the
statute vests with the issuer's board; (ii) the potential of the statute to

rights. PIMCO may also consider what impact the merger or acquisition may have
on groups/organizations other than the issuer's shareholders.

     2.   CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS. With respect to a proxy proposal that
includes a spin-off, PIMCO may consider the tax and regulatory advantages,
planned use of sale proceeds, market focus, and managerial incentives. With
respect to a proxy proposal that includes an asset sale, PIMCO may consider the
impact on the balance sheet or working capital and the value received for the
asset. With respect to a proxy proposal that includes a liquidation, PIMCO may
consider management's efforts to pursue alternatives, the appraisal value of
assets, and the compensation plan for executives managing the liquidation.

     INVESTMENT COMPANY PROXIES

For a client that is invested in an investment company, PIMCO votes each proxy
of the investment company on a case-by-case basis and takes all reasonable steps
to ensure that proxies are voted consistent with all applicable investment
policies of the client and in accordance with any resolutions or other
instructions approved by authorized persons of the client.

For a client that is invested in an investment company that is advised by PIMCO

and the investment company), PIMCO will resolve the conflict by doing any one of
the following: (i) voting in accordance with the instructions/consent of the

agreements; and (iii) likelihood that deferral of default will give the obligor
an opportunity to improve its business operations.

               the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's
               second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that
               has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
               affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
               reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the

          (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
               which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
               information; and

          (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
