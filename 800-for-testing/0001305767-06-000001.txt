LETTER TO SHAREOWNERS 11/30/05
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareowner,
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The economy remains strong. Third quarter profits, coming in well above 10%
year-over-year, were surprising in light of the serious economic challenges that
developed over the last three months. The vexing economic questions that arose
from 2005's disastrous hurricane season began to resolve themselves by late
fall, allowing prices for oil and gasoline to retreat from their storm-induced
peaks, as Gulf Coast facilities began to come back on line. The Federal Reserve
Board continued to raise interest rates, and business activity remained strong,
despite storm-related dislocations.

Even with moderating energy prices, businesses and households in colder areas of
the country face uncomfortably large bills for heat and utilities for the coming
winter while ravaged energy production facilities are refurbished. The national
savings rate stands near zero, leaving many households ill prepared for hefty
gasoline and heating costs.

However, costly energy and higher interest rates have not slowed the economy to
date. American consumers, whose outlays are key to the economy's direction, are
notably resilient. Consumer confidence rebounded in November after a
post-hurricane lag, according to the University of Michigan. Furthermore, hiring
trends are fairly positive and recent readings of leading economic indicators by
the Conference Board have shown an upward bias.

The U.S. has enjoyed ten straight quarters of expansion at an annualized rate of
3% or better. Barring surprises, we expect continued, though possibly slower,
growth in the period ahead. For appropriate investors, carefully selected
high-quality equity and bond mutual funds still have the potential to deliver
solid results even in a slow-growth environment. With that in mind, our global
investment experts are well positioned to seek attractive opportunities around
the world.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.pioneerfunds.com for the most recent month-end
performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold
in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower
than their NAV. NAV is total assets less total liabilities, which includes
preferred shares, divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at market price.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
shares.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is designed
to mirror the investable universe of the $US-denominated leveraged loan market.
As of March 30, 2001, the Index included $148 billion in tradable term loans.
Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. You
cannot invest directly in an Index.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 11/30/05
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This annual report for Pioneer Floating Rate Trust covers the period since the
Trust's inception on December 23, 2004 through November 30, 2005. In the report,
portfolio managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of Highland Capital
Management discuss the investment process, strategy and outlook.

Q:   How did the Trust perform during the period?

A:   Since inception on December 23, 2004 through November 30, 2005, Pioneer
     Floating Rate Trust posted a total return of 5.40% at net asset value and
     -9.76% at market price, after underwriting fees of 4.50%. The Trust's
     benchmark, the Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) Leveraged Loan Index,
     returned 5.16% since the beginning of 2005. The Trust slightly
     underperformed the benchmark due to the costs associated with the issuance
     of the preferred shares. At the end of November, the Trust was selling at a
     discount of market price to net asset value of -10.17%.

     From the end of December 2004 through November 2005, the federal funds
     target rate rose 175 basis points to 4.00%. (A basis point is 0.01%.)
     During this same period the yield on the three-month London Interbank
     Offered Rate (LIBOR) rose from 2.56% to 4.42%. LIBOR is the rate of
     interest at which banks borrow funds from other banks, in marketable size,
     in the London Interbank market.

     Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.pioneerfunds.com for the most recent
     month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher
     than the performance data quoted.

     The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no
     guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will
     fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their
     original cost.

Q:   What were the principal strategies used in managing the Trust?

A:   Our strategies are driven by our philosophy that fundamental research and a
     disciplined buy/sell process can produce strong long-term results. Because
     we have one of the largest investment teams in the senior secured loan
     market, we are able to monitor closely every asset in the Trust as well as
     keep an eye on assets that we may want to add in the future. Our large
     investment team allows us to focus on middle-market and upper middle-market
     companies. This widespread emphasis has resulted in a diversified port-

     folio, and we continue to seek investment opportunities in senior secured
     loans that might not be widely syndicated to the market.

     In managing the Trust, we stay fully invested, using excess cash to buy new
     issue loans. Our large size provides us with an opportunity to obtain
     better allocations in the new issue market. Staying fully invested helps us
     earn a rate that is higher than LIBOR, instead of earning only the interest
     rate currently paid on cash balances.

     We also take advantage of second liens and select bonds to enhance the
     yield on the Trust. We understand the risk inherent in second liens and
     closely monitor these investments. From a risk/reward perspective, we
     believe we can increase the Trust's yield without taking on too much added
     risk.

Q:   What was the investment environment like for senior loans during the
     period?

A:   The leveraged-loan markets were strong performers during the 12 months
     ended November 30, 2005. Supply was greater than in 2004, as leveraged loan
     volume, according to Standard & Poor's/ Leveraged Commentary & Data,
     increased from approximately $246 million to approximately $282 million.
     The 12-month dollar-denominated default rate was up slightly to 1.65% on
     September 30, 2005, versus 1.39% on June 30, 2005, according to the Altman
     High Yield Bond Default and Return Report. This default rate is well below
     the historical average of about 2.50%, according to Credit Suisse First
     Boston.

     Spreads on loans, as tracked by the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index, tightened
     during the fiscal year from 293 basis points to 258 basis points. However,
     the tightening in spreads was offset by a significant increase in LIBOR.
     From November 30, 2004 through November 30, 2005, the three-month LIBOR
     rose from 2.41% to 4.42%. As a result, the weighted average coupon on
     leveraged loans, as tracked by the CSFB Leveraged Loan index, rose from
     5.11% to 6.81% for the same period.

Q:   How is the Trust currently positioned?

A:   Approximately 96.0% of the Trust is invested in loans and about 4.0% is in
     bonds. About 11.5% is in second lien loans. The Trust is well diversified
     with approximately 199 borrowers represented in the portfolio. Examples of
     some of our core positions include: Home Interiors & Gifts, a manufacturer
     and distributor of home

     decorative accessories; Charter Communications Operating, which offers
     cable television programming, Internet access, broadband cable services,
     and telephone services; and Blockbuster, which rents, sells and trades
     entertainment-related merchandise. The cable, utilities and retail
     industries account for some of the larger industries in the portfolio. We
     believe these industries offer attractive risk/return prospects.

Q:   In September the monthly dividend rose to $0.115 per share. What's behind
     the increase?

A:   Two factors were instrumental in boosting the dividend. First, we were able
     to increase the Trust's weighted-average spread from approximately 327
     basis points at the beginning of June to approximately 368 basis points at
     the end of November. Second, as noted above, LIBOR rose during the period.

Q:   What is your outlook?

A:   We think the leveraged loan market will continue to perform well in 2006.
     The Federal Reserve raised rates to 4.00% in November, which we believe
     continues to be accommodative. (On December 13, 2005, the Fed raised the
     target rate another 25 basis points to 4.25%.) While we believe defaults
     may rise slightly, they should remain below the historical average. Loan
     volume reached a record $23 billion during November 2005, according to
     Standard and Poor's loan statistics, and is expected to remain strong at
     least over the short term. Our view is that the economy is improving, and
     we do not expect any Fed easing in the near future. Information regarding
     the Trust's principal investment risks is contained in the Trust's
     prospectus(es). Please refer to those documents when considering the
     Trust's risks.

     Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
     greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
     that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

     When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the
     Trust will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices
     of fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The floating
     rate feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not experience capital
     appreciation in a declining interest rate environment. Investments in the
     Trust are subject to

                                                                               7

     possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of underlying
     securities and their inability to meet their debt obligations.

     The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
     and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

     The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
     invested in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
     Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the
     times when the trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market
     price is generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities.
     Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the
     Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to
     take advantage of market opportunities.

     The Trust may use leverage through the issuance of preferred shares with an
     aggregate liquidation preference of up to 33 1/3% of the Trust's total
     assets after such issuance. Leverage creates significant risks, including
     the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be
     sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
     return for the holders of common shares.

     The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher
     percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund. Being
     non-diversified may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events
     affecting a particular issuer.

     Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic
     trends or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future
     performance are statements of the opinion of Trust management as of the
     date of this report. These statements should not be relied upon for any
     other purposes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and
     there is no guarantee that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Glossary of Terms:
DIP - Debtor-In-Possession

Senior floating rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash flows
or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The rate at which the borrower
repays cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual remaining
maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11/30/05
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware business
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 23, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the sale and issuance
to Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc., an affiliate of Pioneer Investment
Management, Inc. ("PIM"), the Trust's investment adviser, a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredito Italiano S.p.A. (UniCredito Italiano), of
5,240 shares of beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,084.
PIM has paid all the Trust's organizational expenses and has paid the amount by
which the aggregate offering costs (other than the sales load) exceeded $0.04
per share of the common share offering. The investment objective of the Trust is
to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a secondary
objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its
primary goal of high current income.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments, including
second lien loans, and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may
invest in Senior Loans and other securities of any credit quality, including
Senior Loans and other investments that are rated below investment grade, or are
unrated but are determined by the investment subadviser to be of equivalent
credit quality. Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is
contained in the Trust's Prospectus(es). Please refer to these documents when
considering the Fund's risks.

Debt securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as "junk
bonds" and are considered speculative. These securities involve greater risk of
loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid, especially
during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt
securities.

Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Fund may invest in securities of issuers that are
in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities may
be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the trust believes
it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more volatile than
that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to
value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict
the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust
in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with those
generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.   Security Valuation

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior Loans are
     valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of Trustees
     at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or
     more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the
     limited number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes are
     available, such Senior Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
     through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations. If Loan
     Pricing Corporation does not provide a value for the Senior Loans, the
     investment sub-adviser will value the Senior Loans at fair value, which is
     intended to approximate market value.

     Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by values obtained
     from dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued
     at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded.
     Securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at
     their fair values as determined by, or under the direction of, the Board of
     Trustees.

                                                                              31

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11/30/05                             (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at
     various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such securities
     used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are determined
     as of such times. The Trust may also use the fair value of a security,
     including a non U.S. security, when the closing market price on the
     principal exchange where the security is traded no longer accurately
     reflects the value of the security as of the close of the exchange. At
     November 30, 2005, the Trust held no fair valued securities. Temporary cash
     investments are valued at amortized cost.

     Discount and premium on debt securities are accreted or amortized daily,
     respectively, on an effective yield to maturity basis and are included in
     interest income. Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash
     accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis.

     The Trust's investments in foreign markets or countries with limited
     developing markets may subject the Trust to greater degree of risk than in
     a developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
     conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
     currency exchange restrictions.

     Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
     cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
     among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
     contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between the
     amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received. Further,
     the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments
     are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of
     changes in market price of those securities but are included with the net
     realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
     shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

     The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
     financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
     income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may be
     shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess
     of net investment income or net realized gain on investment transactions,
     or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax differences that
     may exist.

     At November 30, 2005, the Trust reclassified $1,519,689 to decrease
     undistributed net investment income and to increase accumulated net
     realized gain on investments. The reclassification has no impact on the net
     asset value of the Trust and presents the Trust's capital accounts on a tax
     basis.

     The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and
     preferred shareowners during the period ended November 30, 2005 was as
     follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation is
     primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
     methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities.

D.   Repurchase Agreements

     With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
     of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
     received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
     excess of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase. The collateral
     for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
     account of the Trust's custodian, or subcustodians. PIM is responsible for
     determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the
     repurchase price.

E.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
     Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
     dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
     full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners
     may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not participating in
     the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
     Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
     resumed at any time by notifying Mellon Investor Services LLC, the agent
     for shareowners in administering the Plan (the "Plan Agent"), prior to any
     dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
     effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
     distribution. Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares
     payable in cash, participants in the Plan will receive

34
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     the equivalent in common shares acquired by the Plan Agent either (i)
     through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares from
     the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding common shares on the New York
     Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any dividend the
     net asset value per common share is equal to or less than the market price
     per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees ("market premium"), the
     Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued common shares.
     The number of newly issued common shares to be credited to each account
     will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net
     asset value per common share on the date the shares are issued, provided
     that the maximum discount from the then current market price per share on
     the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any
     dividend, the net asset value per common share is greater than the market
     value ("market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount
     in common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage
     charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However, each
     participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
     with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in
     the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local
     taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners
     holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the
     shares to another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2.   Management Agreement

The Trust has entered into an advisory agreement with PIM. Management fees are
calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily value of the Trust's total
assets minus the sum of the Trust's liabilities, which liabilities exclude debt
related to leverage, short-term debt and the aggregate liquidation preference of
any outstanding preferred shares. At November 30, 2005, $435,251 was payable to
PIM related to management fees.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. For the year
period ended November 30, 2005, the Trust recorded $35,000 in reimbursement and
is included in "Administration fees and reimbursement" on the Statement of
Operations.

                                                                              35

PIM has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments. Under
the terms of the sub-advisory agreement, for its services, the Sub-adviser is
entitled to a sub-advisory fee from PIM at an annual rate of 0.35% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. The fee is paid monthly in arrears. The
Trust does not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

The Trust has entered into an administration agreement with PIM pursuant to
which PIM will provide certain administrative and accounting services to the
Trust. PIM has appointed Princeton Administrators, L.P. ("Princeton") as the
sub-administrator to the Trust to perform certain of PIM's administration and
accounting obligations to the Trust. Under the administration agreement, the
Trust pays PIM a monthly fee equal to 0.07% of the Trust's average daily managed
assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in excess
of $500 million. PIM and not the Trust, is responsible for paying the fees of
Princeton, which is affiliated with Merrill, Lynch & Co.

Also, PIM has agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations to limit the Trust's total annual expenses [excluding offering costs
for common and preferred shares, interest expense, the cost of defending or
prosecuting any claim or litigation to which the Trust is a party (together with
any amount in judgment or settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes
incurred due to the failure of the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company under the Code or any other non-recurring or non-operating expenses] to
0.95% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. The dividend on any preferred
shares is not an expense for this purpose. For the period ended November 30,
2005, the Trust's expenses were not reduced under such arrangements.

3.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into any contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver
currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust
must make delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the
settlement date of a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by
entering into an offsetting hedge contract. At November 30, 2005, the Trust had
no outstanding portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

5.   Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. ("PIMSS"), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredito Italiano, through a sub-transfer agency
agreement with Mellon Investor Services LLC, provides substantially all transfer
agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at negotiated
rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the transfer agent, registrar,
dividend paying agent and redemption agent with respect to the Trust's Auction
Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). The Trust pays Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, for providing such services.

6.   Trust Shares

There are an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial interest
authorized. Of the 24,330,240 common shares of beneficial interest outstanding
at November 30, 2005, PIM owned 5,240 shares.

                                                                              37

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Offering costs of $973,000 incurred in connection with the Trust's offering of
common shares have been charged to paid-in capital.

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. On
March 28, 2005, the Trust reclassified and issued 9,380 common shares into three
series of AMPS as follows: Series M7-3,130, Series W7-3,125 and Series
TH7-3,125. Offering costs of $401,907 and underwriting discounts of $2,345,000
have been charged to paid-in capital.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates
ranged from 2.98% to 4.00% during the period ended November 30, 2005.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding
preferred shares would be less than 200%.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Agreement and
Declaration of Trust are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred
shares and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including,
among other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

7.   Subsequent Event

Subsequent to November 30, 2005, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.115 per common share and
from net short term capital gains of $0.048453 per common share payable December
30, 2005, to common shareowners of record on December 12, 2005.

For the period December 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005, dividends declared on
preferred stock totaled $753,310 in aggregate for the three outstanding
preferred share series.

CEO CERTIFICATION DISCLOSURE (unaudited)

The Trust's Chief Executive Officer has submitted to the New York Stock Exchange

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") as of
November 30, 2005, and the related statements of operations, changes in net
assets and the financial highlights for the period from December 23, 2004
(commencement of operations) to November 30, 2005. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of November 30, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust at November 30, 2005, the results of its operations,
changes in net assets and the financial highlights for the period from December
23, 2004 (commencement of operations) to November 30, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Additional Information Regarding the Trust's Investment Policies

The Trust's Board of Trustees has authorized the Trust to enter into cross
currency interest rate swaps and invest in commercial mortgage-backed
securities.

Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps

The Trust may, but is not required to, use various currency and interest rate
transactions to earn income, facilitate portfolio management and mitigate risks.
The Board has authorized the use of cross currency interest rate swaps, in
addition to other instruments that the Fund may use for these purposes.

A swap contract is an agreement to exchange the return generated by one
instrument for another. Payment streams typically are calculated by reference to
a specified rate, such as an index, interest or currency rate, for an agreed
upon transaction amount and time period. For example, with an interest rate
swap, the Trust might agree to swap the return generated by a floating interest
rate for the return generated by a fixed interest rate. The Trust might enter
into such a transaction if the Trust's subadviser anticipated that the
prevailing floating rate was likely to decline and believed that converting it
to a fixed rate would enhance the Trust's return. Currency swaps usually involve
the delivery of the entire principal value of one designated currency in
exchange for the other designated currency. The Trust might use a currency swap
to lock in the exchange rate on the principal of a loan

                                                                              41
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

denominated in euro if the subadviser believed that the value of the euro might
decline relative to the U.S. dollar.

Cross currency interest rate swap agreements combine features of currency swap
agreements and interest rate swap agreements. The cross currency interest rate
swaps in which the Trust may enter generally will involve both the exchange of
currency and the payment of interest streams with reference to one currency
based on a specified index in exchange for receiving interest streams with
reference to the other currency. Such swaps may involve initial and final
exchanges that correspond to the agreed upon transaction amount. For example,
the payment stream on a specified amount of euro based on a European market
floating rate might be exchanged for a U.S. oriented floating rate on the same
principal amount converted into U.S. dollars.

The risks of various types of swap agreements, strategic transactions and
derivatives are described in the Trust's prospectus. The use of swap agreements
is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions.
Depending on the state of currency and interest rates in general, the Trust's
use of cross currency interest rate swaps could enhance or harm the Trust's
overall performance. To the extent there are lower prevailing interest rates or
currency valuations in the local market relative to those in the U.S., the value
of the swap could decline, which could result in a decline in the Trust's net
asset value.

In connection with these transactions, the Trust relies on the other party to
the transaction to perform its obligations pursuant to the underlying agreement.
If there were a default by the other party, the Trust would have contractual
remedies, but could incur delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the
expected benefit of the transaction. The entire principal value of a currency
swap is subject to the risk that the other party to the swap will default on its
delivery obligations.

Although the Trust may enter into currency-related transactions to reduce
currency exchange risks, changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer
overall performance for the Trust than if it had not engaged in such
transactions. Moreover, there may be an imperfect correlation between the
Trust's portfolio holdings of securities and the instruments that the Trust uses
to hedge interest rate or currency exposure. An imperfect correlation of this
type may prevent the

42
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trust from achieving the intended hedge or expose the Trust to the risk of
currency exchange loss.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Trust may invest in mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities,
including securities with respect to which the underlying mortgages are on
commercial properties. These securities may include mortgage pass-through
certificates and multiple-class pass-through securities, and mortgage derivative
securities such as real estate mortgage investment conduits ("REMICs"),
pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") and
stripped mortgage-backed securities ("SMBS"), interest only mortgage-backed
securities, principal only mortgage-backed securities, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and other types of mortgage-backed securities that
may be available in the future. A mortgage-backed security is an obligation of
the issuer backed by a mortgage or pool of mortgages or a direct interest in an
underlying pool of mortgages. Some mortgage-backed securities, such as CMOs,
make payments of both principal and interest at a variety of intervals; others
make semi-annual interest payments at a predetermined rate and repay principal
at maturity (like a typical bond). Mortgage-backed securities are based on
different types of mortgages including those on commercial real estate or
residential properties. Mortgage-backed securities often have stated maturities
of up to thirty years when they are issued, depending upon the length of the
mortgages underlying the securities. In practice, however, unscheduled or early
payments of principal and interest on the underlying mortgages may make the
securities' effective maturity shorter than this, and the prevailing interest
rates may be higher or lower than the current yield of the Trust's portfolio at
the time the Trust receives the payments for reinvestment (prepayment risk).
During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain types of
securities may be extended because of slower than expected principal payments.
This may lock in a below market interest rate, increase the security's duration
(the estimated period until the security is paid in full) and reduce the value
of the security (extension risk). To the extent the Trust invests significantly
in mortgage-related securities, its exposure to prepayment and extension risks
may be greater than if it invested in other fixed income securities.

                                                                              43

Mortgage-backed securities may have less potential for capital appreciation than
comparable fixed income securities, due to the likelihood of increased
prepayments of mortgages as interest rates decline. If the Trust buys
mortgage-backed securities at a premium, mortgage foreclosures and prepayments
of principal by mortgagors (which may be made at any time without penalty) may
result in some loss of the Trust's principal investment to the extent of the
premium paid.

Certain mortgage-backed securities may only pay principal at maturity or may
only represent the right to receive payments of principal or interest on
underlying pools of mortgage or government securities, but not both. The value
of these types of instruments may change more drastically than debt securities
that pay both principal and interest during periods of changing interest rates.
Principal only mortgage-backed securities generally increase in value if
interest rates decline, but are also subject to the risk of prepayment. Interest
only instruments generally increase in value in a rising interest rate
environment when fewer of the underlying mortgages are prepaid.

The value of mortgage-backed securities may also change due to shifts in the
market's perception of issuers. In addition, regulatory or tax changes may
adversely affect the mortgage securities markets as a whole. Non-governmental
mortgage-backed securities may offer higher yields than those issued by
government entities, but also may be subject to greater price changes than
governmental issues.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES IN
APPROVING THE MANAGEMENT CONTRACT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that both the Board of Trustees and
a majority of the Independent Trustees (collectively "the Trustees") voting
separately annually approve the Trust's management contract (the "Management
Contract") between the Trust and Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., the
Trust's adviser (the "Investment Adviser"). The Investment Adviser has retained
Highland Capital Management, L.P. (the "Sub-adviser") to act as sub-adviser to
the Trust pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement between the Investment Adviser
and the Sub-adviser (the "Sub-advisory Agreement"). The Trustees have determined
that the terms of the Management Contract and the Sub-advisory Agreement are
fair and reasonable and that renewal of these contracts will enable the Trust to
receive quality investment advisory services at a cost deemed reasonable and is
in the best interests of the Trust and its shareowners. In making such
determinations, the Independent Trustees relied upon the assistance of counsel
to the Independent Trustees and counsel to the Trust.

Throughout the year, the Independent Trustees regularly met in executive session
separately from the Interested Trustees of the Trust and any officer of the
Investment Adviser, or its affiliates. While the Trustees, including the
Independent Trustees, act on all major matters relating to the Trust, a
significant portion of the activities of the Board of Trustees (including
certain of those described herein) is conducted through committees, the members
of which are comprised exclusively of Independent Trustees. Such committee
meetings are attended by officers of the Trust or the Investment Adviser to the
extent requested by the members of the committee.

In evaluating the Management Contract and Sub-advisory Agreement, the Trustees
conducted a review that was specifically focused upon the renewal of the
Management Contract and Sub-advisory Agreement, and relied upon their knowledge,
resulting from their meetings throughout the year, of the Investment Adviser,
its services and the Trust. Both in meetings specifically dedicated to renewal
of the Management Contract and at other meetings during the course of the year,
the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, received materials relating to
the Investment Adviser's investment and management services under the Management
Contract. These materials included (i) information on the investment performance
of the Trust, a peer group of funds and an index, in each case selected by the
Independent Trustees for this purpose, (ii) the general investment outlook in
the markets in which the Fund invests, (iii) the procedures employed to
determine the value of

                                                                              45

each of the Trust's assets, (iv) the Investment Adviser's management of the
relationships with the Trust's unaffiliated service providers, (v) the record of
compliance with the Trust's investment policies and restrictions and with the
Trust's Code of Ethics and the structure and responsibilities of the Investment
Adviser's compliance department, (vi) the nature, cost and character of
non-investment management services provided by the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates, (vii) the disclosures included in the Trust's prospectus and reports
to shareowners, (viii) the investment and compliance staff and operations of the
Subadviser, (ix) an analyses of the benefits and costs of the use of leverage
through the issuance of the Trust's preferred shares and the sensitivity of such
analysis to changes in interest rates and (x) the discount or premium of the
market price of the Trust's common stock relative to its net asset value and
measures that are or could be taken to address any discount.

Specifically, in connection with the Independent Trustees' review of the
Management Contract and the Sub-advisory Agreement, the Independent Trustees
requested and the Investment Adviser provided additional information in order to
evaluate the quality of the Investment Adviser's and Sub-adviser's services and
the reasonableness of the fee under the Management Contract and the Sub-advisory
Agreement. Among other items, this information included data or analyses of (1)
investment performance for the year to date period ended June 30, 2005 for the
Trust and a peer group selected by the Independent Trustees for this purpose,
(2) management and other fees incurred by a peer group of funds selected by the
Independent Trustees for this purpose, (3) the advisory fees of comparable
portfolios of other clients of the Investment Adviser and the Sub-adviser, (4)
expense ratios for the Trust and a peer group of funds selected by the
Independent Trustees for this purpose, (5) the overall organization of the
Investment Adviser, (6) the Investment Adviser's and the Sub-adviser's financial
results and condition, including, in the case of the Investment Adviser, its and
certain of its affiliates profitability from services performed for the Trust,
(7) transfer agency fees and administrative reimbursements paid to the
Investment Adviser or affiliates, (8) investment management staffing, and (9)
operating expenses paid to third parties.

The following summarizes factors considered by the Trustees in connection with
reviewing the information described above and their renewal of the Trust's
Management Contract and Sub-advisory Agreement. The Trustees did not identify
any single factor as all-important or controlling, and the summary does not
detail all the matters that were considered.

A.   Ancillary Benefits to Shareowners. The Trustees considered what was
     believed to be the benefits to shareowners of investing in a closed-end
     fund that is part of an established group of open and closed-end funds. The
     Trustees also noted that the relationship of the market price relative to
     the Trust's net assets attributed to its common shares was comparable
     relative to other closed-end funds with similar investment approaches.

B.   Compliance and Investment Performance. The Trustees determined that the
     Investment Adviser had policies and systems reasonably designed to achieve
     compliance with the Trust's investment objectives and regulatory
     requirements. The Trustees also reviewed the Trust's investment performance
     based upon total return, as well as the Trust's performance compared to
     both the performance of a peer group and an index, in each case selected by
     the Independent Trustees for this purpose. The Trust's performance, based
     upon total return, was in the first quintile of the peer group for the year
     to date period ended June 30, 2005. (In all quintile rankings referred to
     throughout this discussion first quintile is most favorable to the Trust's
     shareowners. Thus, highest relative performance would be first quintile and
     lowest relative expenses also would be first quintile.) The Trustees
     considered the yield (gross of expenses) to the Trust's common shareholders
     compared to the yield (as of June 30, 2005) of the CFSB Leveraged Loan
     index. The Trustees also considered the activities of the Investment
     Adviser in monitoring the investment and compliance operations of the
     Sub-adviser. The Trustees concluded the Trust had conducted investment
     operations for too short a period to evaluate performance.

C.   The Investment Adviser's Personnel and Methods. The Trustees reviewed the
     background of members of the team responsible for the daily management of
     the Trust and the Trust's investment objective and discipline. The
     Independent Trustees also have had discussions with senior management of
     the Investment Adviser responsible for investment operations. Among other
     things, the

                                                                              47

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Trustees considered the number, education and experience of the
     Sub-adviser's investment staff. The Trustees concluded that the Investment
     Adviser and the Sub-adviser have the quality and depth of personnel and the
     well-developed methods essential to performing its duties under the
     Management Contract and the Sub-advisory Agreement.

D.   Nature and Quality of Other Services. The Trustees considered the nature,
     quality, cost and extent of other services provided to shareowners of the
     Trust, including administrative and shareowner services performed by the
     Investment Adviser under the Management Contract. The Trustees also
     considered the reasonableness of the arrangements for reimbursement of the
     Investment Adviser's out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including overhead,
     for certain administrative services that the Investment Adviser is not
     required to provide under the Management Contract. The Trustees also
     considered the nature and extent of the other services provided by the
     Investment Adviser's affiliates under other contracts and its supervision
     of third party service providers. Based on these considerations, the
     Trustees concluded that the nature, quality, cost and extent of such
     services are satisfactory and reliable and serve the shareowners of the
     Trust well.

E.   Management Fee and Expenses. The Trustees considered the Investment
     Adviser's fee under the Management Contract relative to the management fees
     charged by a peer group of funds selected by the Independent Trustees for
     this purpose using data provided by an independent third party. The
     Trustees noted that, although the peer group was small, the Trust's
     management fee was the lowest in the peer group. The Trustees determined
     that the fee under the Management Contract was reasonable and fair in light
     of both the overall nature and quality of services provided by the
     Investment Adviser and the fees charged by the funds in the peer group. The
     Trustees also evaluated the fee under the Sub-advisory Agreement and the
     portion of the fee under the Management Contract retained by the Investment
     Adviser and determined that they were consistent with other sub-advised
     funds. The Trustees also considered the Trust's expense ratio and expense
     ratios of a peer group of funds selected by the Independent Trustees for
     this purpose. The Trustees noted that, although the peer group was small,
     the Trust's expense ratio was favorable compared to the expense ratios of
     the peer funds. The Trustees concluded that

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     the Trust's overall expense ratio (after expense limitations) was
     reasonable compared to that of comparable funds.

F.   Profitability. The Trustees considered the level of the Investment
     Adviser's profits with respect to the management of the Pioneer funds,
     including details with respect to the Trust. This consideration included a
     review of the Investment Adviser's methodology in allocating certain of its
     costs to the management of each fund. The Trustees also considered the
     financial results realized by the Investment Adviser in connection with the
     operation of the Trust. They further considered the profits realized by the
     Investment Adviser and its affiliates from non-fund businesses that may
     benefit from or be related to the Trust's business. The Trustees considered
     the Investment Adviser's profit margins in comparison with the limited
     available industry data. The Trustees concluded that the Investment
     Adviser's profits from management of the Pioneer funds, including the
     financial results derived from the Trust, bear a reasonable relationship to
     the services rendered and are fair for the management of the Trust.

G.   Economies of Scale. The Trustees considered whether the Trust has
     appropriately benefited from any economies of scale, and whether there is
     potential for realization of any further economies of scale. Since the
     Trust is a closed-end fund and its size is relatively stable and at the
     level of assets that was anticipated when the management fee was initially
     set, the Trustees concluded that economies of scale were not a relevant
     consideration.

H.   Other Benefits to the Investment Adviser. The Trustees also considered the
     character and amount of fees paid by the Trust, other than under the
     Management Contract, for services provided by the Investment Adviser and
     affiliates. The Trustees further considered the revenues and profitability
     of the Investment Adviser's businesses other than the fund business,
     including the Investment Adviser's institutional investment advisory
     business. The Trustees considered the intangible benefits that accrue to
     the Investment Adviser and its affiliates by virtue of its relationship
     with the Trust and the Pioneer funds as a group. The Trustees concluded
     that all these types of benefits accruing to the Investment Adviser were
     reasonable in the context of the overall relationship between the
     Investment Adviser and the Trust.

                                                                              49

Conclusion. The Trustees, in light of the Investment Adviser's and Sub-adviser's
overall performance, considered it appropriate to continue to retain the
management services of the Investment Adviser and the Sub-adviser. Based on
their evaluation of all material factors deemed relevant and the advice of
independent counsel, the Trustees concluded that the Management Contract with
the Trust and the Sub-advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and voted to
approve the continuation of the Management Contract and the Sub-advisory
Agreement for another year.

 PIONEER TrustS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Trusts recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Trusts recognize that a Trust's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge
of the Trusts, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Trust personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Trusts. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Trust's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Trusts when retaining the independent audit
firm to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Trust shall also
constitute approval for any other Trust whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Trust's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                 firm, the scope of the Audit

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Trusts and the Trust's auditors will
  each make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not
  impair independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6,
2003, the effective date of the new SEC pre-approval rules, the Trust's
audit committee is required to pre-approve services to affiliates defined
by SEC rules to the extent that the services are determined to have a direct
impact on the operations or financial reporting of the Trust.  For the years
ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, there were no services provided to an
affiliate that required the Trust's audit committee pre-approval.


(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Trust and affiliates, as previously
defined, totaled $21,300 in 2005.

The Trust's audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether
the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Affiliates (as
defined) that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Trust's independent auditor, Ernst &
Young LLP ("E&Y"), has advised the Audit
Committee of the Trust's Board of Trustees that
E&Ys Spanish affiliate (E&Y Spain) performed
certain non-audit work for Pioneer Global
Investments Limited ("PGIL"), an affiliate of the
Trusts investment adviser.  The services involved
the receipt and disbursement of monies transferred
to E&Y Spain by PGIL in payment of individual
payroll and related income tax withholdings due on
returns prepared by E&Y Spain for certain PGIL
employees located in Spain from February 2001 to
October 2005.  E&Y became auditors of the Trust in
May 2002.  These payroll and tax services were
discontinued in November 2005.  The annual fee
received by E&Y Spain for all such services totaled
approximately 9,000 Euro per year. E&Y has informed
the Audit Committee that based on its internal
reviews and the de minimus nature of the services
provided and fees received, E&Y does not believe
its independence with respect to the Trust has been
impaired or that it is disqualified from acting as
independent auditors to the Trust.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
 audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,
identify each committee member. If the entire board of directors
is acting as the registrants audit committee as specified in
Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(B)),
so state.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit
committe eestablished in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3(d)) regarding an exemption
from the listing standards for audit committees.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

this Form N-CSR must, unless it invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that the
company uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of its
shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the company's investment adviser;
principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

Not applicable, the Fund does not invest in voting securities.

</TABLE>

Potential Conflicts of Interest. When a portfolio manager is responsible for the
management  of more than one account,  the  potential  arises for the  portfolio
manager to favor one account  over  another.  The  principal  types of potential
conflicts  of  interest  that may arise are  discussed  below.  For the  reasons
outlined below,  Pioneer does not believe that any material conflicts are likely
to arise out of a portfolio  manager's  responsibility for the management of the
fund as well  as one or  more  other  accounts.  Although  Pioneer  has  adopted
procedures  that it  believes  are  reasonably  designed  to detect and  prevent
violations  of the federal  securities  laws and to mitigate the  potential  for
conflicts of interest to affect its portfolio management decisions, there can be
no assurance that all conflicts  will be identified or that all procedures  will
be effective in mitigating the potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of
such conflicts of interests are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager
has a  financial  incentive  to favor one  account  over  another.  Pioneer  has
structured its  compensation  arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit
such  potential for conflicts of interests.  The fund's  investment  sub-adviser
also has adopted  certain  compliance  procedures  which are designed to address
these types of conflicts.  However,  there is no guarantee that such  procedures
will detect each situation in which a conflict might arise.

     o    A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating
          new investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial
          public offerings and private  placements.  If, for example, an initial
          public offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly
          shortly  after the offering was  allocated to a single  account,  that
          account may be expected to have  better  investment  performance  than
          other  accounts  that did not  receive an  allocation  of the  initial
          public  offering.  Generally,  investments  for which there is limited
          availability  are  allocated  based upon a range of factors  including
          available  cash  and   consistency   with  the  accounts'   investment
          objectives  and  policies.  This  allocation  methodology  necessarily
          involves some  subjective  elements but is intended over time to treat
          each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
          opportunity is allocated  among  participating  accounts on a pro rata
          basis.  Although  Pioneer  believes that its practices are  reasonably
          designed to treat each client in an equitable  and fair manner,  there
          may be instances where a fund may not participate,  or may participate
          to a  lesser  degree  than  other  clients,  in the  allocation  of an
          investment opportunity.

     o    A portfolio  manager could favor one account over another in the order
          in which trades for the accounts  are placed.  If a portfolio  manager
          determines  to  purchase  a security  for more than one  account in an
          aggregate  amount that may influence the market price of the security,
          accounts that  purchased or sold the security first may receive a more
          favorable price than accounts that made subsequent  transactions.  The
          less liquid the market for the security or the greater the  percentage
          that the proposed  aggregate  purchases or sales  represent of average
          daily trading volume, the greater the potential for accounts that make
          subsequent  purchases or sales to receive a less favorable price. When
          a portfolio manager intends to trade the same security on the same day
          for more than one account,  the trades  typically are "bunched," which
          means that the trades for the  individual  accounts are aggregated and
          each account receives the same price. There are some types of accounts
          as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons (such
          as  directed  brokerage  arrangements).  Circumstances  may also arise
          where the trader  believes  that bunching the orders may not result in
          the best possible  price.  Where those accounts or  circumstances  are
          involved,  Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result
          in as favorable a price as possible for such client.

     o    A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio  manager's
          compensation  is tied to the  performance of that account to a greater
          degree than other accounts managed by the portfolio  manager.  If, for
          example,  the  portfolio  manager  receives  a bonus  based  upon  the
          performance of certain  accounts  relative to a benchmark  while other
          accounts are disregarded for this purpose,  the portfolio manager will
          have a financial incentive to seek to have the accounts that determine
          the portfolio manager's bonus achieve the best possible performance to
          the  possible  detriment  of other  accounts.  Similarly,  if  Pioneer
          receives a  performance-based  advisory fee, the portfolio manager may
          favor that  account,  whether or not the  performance  of that account
          directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

     o    A portfolio  manager could favor an account if the  portfolio  manager
          has a beneficial  interest in the account, in order to benefit a large
          client or to compensate a client that had poor  returns.  For example,
          if the portfolio manager held an interest in an investment partnership
          that was one of the accounts  managed by the  portfolio  manager,  the
          portfolio  manager  would  have an  economic  incentive  to favor  the
          account in which the portfolio manager held an interest.

     o    If the different accounts have materially and potentially  conflicting
          investment  objectives  or  strategies,  a conflict of interest  could
          arise. For example,  if a portfolio  manager  purchases a security for
          one account and sells the same  security  for  another  account,  such
          trading  pattern may  disadvantage  either the account that is long or
          short. In making portfolio manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid
          such potentially  conflicting  situations.  However, where a portfolio
          manager  is  responsible   for  accounts  with  differing   investment
          objectives  and policies,  it is possible  that the portfolio  manager
          will conclude that it is in the best interest of one account to sell a
          portfolio security while another account continues to hold or increase
          the holding in such security.

(a)(3)

Compensation of Portfolio Managers.  Highland's financial  arrangements with its
portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at
all  levels  reflect  the  value  senior  management  places  on key  resources.
Compensation  may include a variety of components and may vary from year to year
based on a number of factors  including the relative  performance of a portfolio
managers underlying account,  the combined performance of the portfolio managers
underlying  accounts,  and the relative  performance  of the portfolio  managers
underlying accounts measured against other employees.  The principal  components
of compensation include a base salary, a discretionary bonus, various retirement
benefits and one or more of the incentive  compensation  programs established by
Highland such as the Option It Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Base compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based
on their  seniority  and/or their position with the firm,  which may include the
amount of assets supervised and other management roles within the firm.

Discretionary compensation. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive  discretionary  compensation,  which can be a substantial portion of
total compensation.  Discretionary compensation can include a discretionary cash
bonus as well as one or more of the following:

          o    Option It Plan.  The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain
               the  highest  quality  employees  for  positions  of  substantial
               responsibility,  and to provide additional incentives to a select
               group of management or highly  compensated  employees of the Fund
               so as to promote the success of the Fund.

          o    Long Term  Incentive  Plan.  The purpose of the Plan is to create
               positive  morale and teamwork,  to attract and retain key talent,
               and to encourage the achievement of common goals.  The Plan seeks
               to reward participating employees based on the increased value of
               Highland through the use of Long-term Incentive Units.

Senior  portfolio  managers  who perform  additional  management  functions  may
receive  additional  compensation  in these other  capacities.  Compensation  is
structured such that key professionals benefit from remaining with the firm.
