Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund's (the "Fund") annual reporting period ended
October 31, 2003.

Investment Objective and Policies

The Fund is a closed-end management investment company designed for investors
who seek high current income exempt from regular federal income tax. Under
normal conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80%, and normally
substantially all, of its assets in municipal securities paying interest that
is exempt from regular federal income tax. In addition, the Fund normally
invests at least 75% of its assets in investment grade municipal securities.

Investment Results

The following table provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended October 31, 2003. For comparison, returns for the Lipper General
Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average (the "Lipper Average") are also
included. The funds that comprise the Lipper Average have generally similar
investment objectives to the Fund, although investment policies and sales and
management fees for the various funds may differ.

Fund's net asset value (NAV) as of October 31, 2003. All fees and expenses
related to the operation of the Fund have been deducted. Returns for the Fund
include the reinvestment of any distributions paid during each period. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results.

The unmanaged Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index does not reflect fees and
expenses associated with the active management of a mutual fund portfolio. The
Index is a broad based total return performance benchmark for the long-term
investment grade, tax-exempt bond market. The Lipper General Municipal Debt
Funds (Leveraged) Average is comprised of leveraged closed-end funds with
generally similar investment objectives to the Fund, although some may have
different investment policies and sales and management fees. The Lipper Average
included 64 and 62 funds for the six-month and 12-month periods ended October
31, 2003, respectively. An investor cannot invest directly in an index or an
average, and its results are not indicative of any specific investment,
including Alliance National Municipal Income Fund.

Investment Results

For the six months ended October 31, 2003, the municipal bond market posted
positive returns despite municipal rates rising by 0.21%. Over that period, the
Fund outperformed the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. The Fund's
outperformance resulted from strong returns in the Fund's holdings in the
special tax sector and of municipal bonds secured by payments from the master
settlement agreement (MSA bonds) reached with tobacco manufacturers. These
sectors outperformed the overall market. In addition, the Fund's leveraged
structure benefited its performance, primarily because of historically low
borrowing costs. Over the six-month period, the Fund underperformed its Lipper
peer group as represented by the Lipper Average.

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2003, the municipal market generated
positive total returns as interest rates declined for bonds of nearly every
maturity. During this time frame, the Fund outperformed its benchmark. The
Fund's stronger relative performance was largely due to strong returns for the
Fund's insured holdings and for its holdings in the special tax sector. As over
the six-month period, the effect of the Fund's leveraged structure benefited
its performance for the 12-month period. The Fund also performed in line with
its Lipper peer group, as represented by the Lipper Average, over this period.

Market Review

Since April, municipal bond yields have been volatile, in part due to increased
volatility of most fixed income markets. This volatility is shown by the large
difference in yield from the high to low points of the market. For example, the
difference from peak to trough for bonds with maturities of 30 years was 89
basis points, (0.89%). In addition, the rate movement varied significantly by
maturity. Yields for short-term bonds declined by 4 basis points, resulting in
relative outperformance for short-term bonds since the decline in yield caused
their prices to rise. Conversely, long-term bond yields rose by 21 basis points
which caused their prices to fall. The relative outperformance of short-term
bonds caused the yield difference between long and short bonds, known as the
slope of the yield curve, to increase by 25 basis points. Short-term bonds
also posted strong performance compared to taxable fixed income. For example,
the ratio (the municipal yield divided by Treasury yield) of five-year
municipal bond yields to five-year Treasury bond yields declined from 86% to
73%. A declining ratio indicates that municipal bonds are outperforming
Treasury bonds. In comparison, the yield ratio for long-term bonds declined
only slightly from 96% to 95%.

Several sectors of the municipal market experienced significant changes in
relative value over the past six months. In the industrial development sector,
municipal bonds backed by airlines recovered strongly as flight activity
increased and investors discounted concerns regarding the airlines' financial
condition. As mentioned above, MSA bonds also showed improvement in price
compared to most other municipal bonds. This resulted, in part, from declining
issuance reducing supply pres-

sure. In addition, a number of court rulings favoring the tobacco industry
improved the outlook for the sector.

Among the more traditional issuers in the municipal market, state and local
governments have just weathered some of the most difficult financial conditions
in over a decade. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the
combined budget deficit of state governments this year was in excess of $70
billion dollars; as required by state law in most cases, all of these budget
gaps were closed. The State of California, alone, accounted for approximately
$26 billion of the cumulative deficit. The crises faced by state and local
issuers, and the market's reactions, have increased the volatility of general
obligation bonds and have in some cases provided opportunities to acquire
general obligation bonds at cheaper prices than previously available.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
October 31, 2003

NOTE A

Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. Prior to the commencement of operations on January 28,
2002, the Fund had no operations other than the sale to Alliance Capital
Management L.P. (the "Adviser") of 6,667 shares in the amount of $100,005 on
January 23, 2002. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the Untied States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amonts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

In accordance with Pricing Policies adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Fund (the "Pricing Policies") and applicable law, portfolio securities are
valued at current market value or at fair value. The Board of Directors has
delegated to the Adviser, subject to the Board's continuing oversight, certain
responsibilities with respect to the implementation of the Pricing Policies.
Pursuant to the Pricing Policies, securities for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at their current market value. In general, the
market value of these securities is determined as follows:

Securities listed on a national securities exchange or on a foreign securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price at the close of the exchange or
foreign securities exchange. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such
day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, then the security is
valued in good faith at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.
Securities listed on more than one exchange are valued by reference to the
principal exchange on which the securities are traded; securities not listed on
an exchange but traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued
in accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call
options are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that
day, such securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open
futures contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement
price or, in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If
there are no quotations available for the day of valuations, the last available
closing settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter
market, (but excluding securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of
the current bid and asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau
or other comparable sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt
instruments having 60 days or less remaining until maturity are valued at
amortized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18  o  Alliance National Municipal Income Fund


less, or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if
their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities,
including mortgage backed and asset backed securities, may be valued on the
basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one
or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are
obtained, the Pricing Policies provide that the Adviser may establish
procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a
daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other
derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a
major broker/dealer in such security. Securities for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued at fair value in accordance with the
Pricing Policies.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Organization Expenses and Offering Costs

Offering costs of $614,150 ($0.03 per common share) were charged to paid-in
capital of the Fund at the completion of the initial offering of common shares
on January 28, 2002. The Adviser agreed to pay the amount by which the
aggregate of all the Fund's organization expenses and all offering costs (other
than sales load) exceeded $0.03 per common share.

Additionally, offering costs and sales load of $283,710 and $1,950,000,
respectively, and offering costs of $110,084 were charged to paid-in capital of
the Fund in connection with the offering of preferred shares during the period
ended October 31, 2002 and the year ended October 31, 2003, respectively.

4. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and
accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

5. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are determined in
accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
To the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require such reclassification. For the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2003 there were no permanent differences.

NOTE B

Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable  to common and preferred shareholders. Such fee is accrued
daily and paid monthly. The Adviser has agreed to waive a portion of its fees
or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of 0.25% of the Fund's average
daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders for the first
5 full years of the Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders in year 6, 0.15% in year
7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the year ended October 31, 2003,
the amount of such fees waived was $1,257,126.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance Global
Investor Services, Inc. (AGIS), an affiliate of the Adviser, the Fund
reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for the
Fund. During the year ended October 31, 2003, there was no reimbursement paid to
AGIS.

20  o  Alliance National Municipal Income Fund


NOTE E

Preferred Stock

The Fund has authorized, issued and outstanding 7,800 shares of Auction
Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series T and W. The dividend rate on the Series M is 1.35% effective
through December 15, 2003. The dividend rate on the Series T is 0.84% effective
through November 4, 2003. The dividend rate on the Series W is 0.92% effective
through November 5, 2003. The dividend rate on the Series TH is 1.70% effective
through August 4, 2005.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.

NOTE F

Distributions To Common Shareholders

The tax character of distributions paid  to common shareholders during the
fiscal periods ended October 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 were as follows:

                                          2003                 2002
                                         -----                -----
Distributions paid from:
Ordinary income                      $    56,946         $    26,652
Tax exempt income                     17,845,503          11,365,824
                                     -----------         -----------
Total distributions paid             $17,902,449         $11,392,476(a)


As of October 31, 2003, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                          $ 4,039,444
Accumulated capital and other losses                      (3,829,443)(b)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                    17,185,598
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                     $17,395,599


(a)  Total distributions paid differ from the statement of changes in net
assets applicable to common shareholders because for tax purposes dividends are
recognized when actually paid.

(b)  On October 31, 2003, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of $
3,829,443, of which $1,199,398 expires in the year 2010 and $2,630,045 expires
in the year 2011. To the extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss
carryforward, such gains will not be distributed.

NOTE G

Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk-- Interest rate risk is the risk that
changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

NOTE H

Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported in the press, the Staff of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General
("NYAG") have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry
identified as "market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain
other regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into
these


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22  o  Alliance National Municipal Income Fund


practices within the industry and have requested that Alliance Capital
Management L.P. ("Alliance Capital"), the Fund's Adviser, provide information
to them. Alliance Capital has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate
with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the
Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by the market.
Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the market timing
and late trading practices that are the subject of the investigations mentioned
above or the lawsuits described below. Please see "Subsequent Events" below for
a description of the agreements reached by Alliance Capital and the SEC and
NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

In addition, more than thirty private lawsuits have been filed against Alliance
Capital and certain other defendants in which plaintiffs make claims
purportedly based on or related to the same practices that are the subject of
the SEC and NYAG investigations referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name
the Fund as a party. Management of the Fund's Adviser believes that these
private lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or financial condition of the Fund.

NOTE I

Subsequent Events

On December 18, 2003, Alliance Capital, the Fund's Adviser, confirmed that it
had reached terms with the SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory
claims relating to the practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some
of the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected
in an Order of the Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is
subject to final, definitive documentation. Among the key provisions of these
agreements are the following:

(i)  Alliance Capital agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the
"Reimbursement Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse
effects of market timing attributable to the market timing relationships
described in the SEC Order (i.e., relationships Alliance Capital maintained
with some investors who were permitted to engage in market timing trades in
some of the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds in return for or in connection with
making investments (which were not actively traded) in other Alliance Capital
products, including hedge funds and mutual funds, for which Alliance Capital
receives advisory fees). According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is
to be paid, in order of priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot
share of losses suffered by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a
proportionate share of advisory fees paid by such fund during the period of
such market timing;

(ii)  Alliance Capital agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some
of the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January
1, 2004, for a period of at least five years; and


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund  o  23


(iii)  Alliance Capital agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that Alliance
Capital's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

(a)  Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing
of the first public offering was $14.30.

(b)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(c)  Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(d)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(e)  These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect
of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(f)  Annualized.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Alliance National Municipal
Income Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the
portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2003, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets
applicable to common shareholders and the financial highlights for the year
then ended and for the period from January 28, 2002 (commencement of
operations) to October 31, 2002. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2003, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. at October 31, 2003, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets
applicable to common shareholders and the financial highlights for the year
then ended and for the period from January 28, 2002 (commencement of
operations) to October 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION (unaudited)

In accordance with Federal tax law, the Fund's designation of "exempt-interest
dividends" paid during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003 was $20,582,327.

As required by Federal tax law rules, shareholders will receive notification of
their portion of the Fund's taxable ordinary dividends (if any) and capital
gain distributions (if any) paid for the 2003 calendar year on Form 1099-DIV
which will be mailed by January 31, 2004.

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund  o  27


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(unaudited)

Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names can elect to
participate in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which
dividends and capital gain distributions to shareholders will be paid in or
reinvested in additional shares of the Fund (the "Dividend Shares"). Equiserve
Trust Company NA, (the "Agent") will act as agent for participants under the
Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of broker or nominee
should contact such broker or nominee to determine whether or how they may
participate in the Plan.

If the Board declares an income distribution or determines to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares or in cash,  non-participants in the
Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent
in shares of Common Stock of the Fund valued as follows:

 (i) If the shares of Common Stock are trading at net asset value or at a
premium above net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new
shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then current market
price.

 (ii) If the shares of Common Stock are trading at a discount from net asset
value at the time of valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or
distribution in cash and apply it to the purchase of the Fund's shares of
Common Stock in the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. Such purchases will be made on or shortly after
the payment date for such dividend or distribution and in no event more than 30
days after such date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
purchase is necessary to comply with Federal securities laws. If, before the
Plan agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset
value of a share of Common Stock, the average purchase price per share paid by
the Plan agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares of Common
Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or
distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Fund.

The Agent will maintain all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnish
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificate form in the name of
the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

There will be no charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund to
satisfy the dividend reinvestment requirements. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Agent's open market purchases of shares.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income taxes that may be payable (or required to be
withheld) on dividends and distributions.

Additional Information

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent
to written notice of the change sent to participants in the Plan at least 90
days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan may
also be amended or terminated by the Agent on at least 90 days' written notice
to participants in the Plan. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Agent at Equiserve Trust Company N.A. c/o Alliance National
Municipal Income fund, P.O. Box 43011, Providence, RI 02940-3011

Since the filing of the most recent amendment to the Fund's registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there have been (i) no
material changes in the Fund's investment objectives or policies, (ii) no
changes to the Fund's charter or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change
of control of the Fund, (iii) no material changes in the principal risk factors
associated with investment in the Fund, and (iv) no change to the persons
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio,
who are David Dowden, and Terrance Hults, each of whom is a Vice President of
the Fund.

                        ALLIANCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P.

                    Statement of Policies and Procedures for
            Voting Proxies on Behalf of Discretionary Client Accounts


Introduction

As a registered investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance
Capital", "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests
of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client
securities in a timely manner and make voting decisions that are in the best
interests of our clients.

This statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. It sets forth our policies and procedures for voting
proxies for our discretionary investment advisory clients, including investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This statement is
applicable to Alliance Capital's growth and value investment groups investing on
behalf of clients in both US and global securities.


PROXY POLICIES

This statement is designed to be responsive to the wide range of subjects that
can have a significant effect on the investment value of the securities held in
our clients' accounts. These policies are not exhaustive due to the variety of
proxy voting issues that we may be required to consider. Alliance Capital
reserves the right to depart from these guidelines in order to avoid voting
decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best interests. In
reviewing proxy issues, we will apply the following general policies:

Elections of Directors: Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or
we determine that there are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for
directors, we will vote in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.
That said, we believe that directors have a duty to respond to shareholder
actions that have received significant shareholder support. We may withhold
votes for directors that fail to act on key issues such as failure to implement
proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote
requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote and failure
to act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their
shares. In addition, we will withhold votes for directors who fail to attend at
least seventy-five percent of board meetings within a given year without a
reasonable excuse. Finally, we may withhold votes for directors of non-U.S.
issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees disclosed in
the proxy statement.

Appointment of Auditors: Alliance Capital believes that the company remains in
the best position to choose the auditors and will generally support management's
recommendation. However, we recognize that there may be inherent conflicts when
a company's independent auditor performs substantial non-audit related services
for the company. Therefore, we may vote against the appointment of auditors if
the fees for non-audit related services are disproportionate to the total audit
fees paid by the company or there are other reasons to question the independence
of the company's auditors.

Changes in Capital Structure: Changes in a company's charter, articles of
incorporation or by-laws are often technical and administrative in nature.
Absent a compelling reason to the contrary, Alliance Capital will cast its votes
in accordance with the company's management on such proposals. However, we will
review and analyze on a case-by-case basis any non-routine proposals that are
likely to affect the structure and operation of the company or have a material
economic effect on the company. For example, we will generally support proposals
to increase authorized common stock when it is necessary to implement a stock
split, aid in a restructuring or acquisition or provide a sufficient number of
shares for an employee savings plan, stock option or executive compensation
plan. However, a satisfactory explanation of a company's intentions must be
disclosed in the proxy statement for proposals requesting an increase of greater
than one hundred percent of the shares outstanding. We will oppose increases in
authorized common stock where there is evidence that the shares will be used to
implement a poison pill or another form of anti-takeover device, or if the
issuance of new shares could excessively dilute the value of the outstanding
shares upon issuance.

Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions: Alliance Capital believes
proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the
investment decision. Accordingly, we will analyze such proposals on a
case-by-case basis, weighing heavily the views of the research analysts that
cover the company and the investment professionals managing the portfolios in
which the stock is held.

Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights: Alliance Capital believes that certain
fundamental rights of shareholders must be protected. We will generally vote in
favor of proposals that give shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of the
company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit those rights. However, when
analyzing such proposals we will weigh the financial impact of the proposal
against the impairment of shareholder rights.

Corporate Governance: Alliance Capital recognizes the importance of good
corporate governance in ensuring that management and the board of directors
fulfill their obligations to the shareholders. We favor proposals promoting
transparency and accountability within a company. For example, we will vote for
proposals providing for equal access to proxies, a majority of independent
directors on key committees, and separating the positions of chairman and chief
executive officer.

Anti-Takeover Measures: Alliance Capital believes that measures that impede
takeovers or entrench management not only infringe on the rights of shareholders
but may also have a detrimental effect on the value of the company. We will
generally oppose proposals, regardless of whether they are advanced by
management or shareholders, the purpose or effect of which is to entrench
management or dilute shareholder ownership. Conversely, we support proposals
that would restrict or otherwise eliminate anti-takeover measures that have
already been adopted by corporate issuers. For example, we will support
shareholder proposals that seek to require the company to submit a shareholder
rights plan to a shareholder vote. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals to completely redeem or eliminate such plans. Furthermore, we will
generally oppose proposals put forward by management (including blank check
preferred stock, classified boards and supermajority vote requirements) that
appear to be intended as management entrenchment mechanisms.

Executive Compensation: Alliance Capital believes that company management and
the compensation committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be
given latitude to determine the types and mix of compensation and benefit awards
offered. Whether proposed by a shareholder or management, we will review
proposals relating to executive compensation plans on a case-by-case basis to
ensure that the long-term interests of management and shareholders are properly
aligned. We will analyze the proposed plans to ensure that shareholder equity
will not be excessively diluted, the option exercise price is not below market
price on the date of grant and an acceptable number of employees are eligible to
participate in such programs. We will generally oppose plans that permit
repricing of underwater stock options without shareholder approval. Other
factors such as the company's performance and industry practice will generally
be factored into our analysis. We will support proposals to submit severance
packages triggered by a change in control to a shareholder vote and proposals
that seek additional disclosure of executive compensation. Finally, we will
support shareholder proposals requiring companies to expense stock options
because we view them as a large corporate expense.

Social and Corporate Responsibility: Alliance Capital will review and analyze on
a case-by-case basis proposals relating to social, political and environmental
issues to determine whether they will have a financial impact on shareholder
value. We will vote against proposals that are unduly burdensome or result in
unnecessary and excessive costs to the company. We may abstain from voting on
social proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on
shareholder value.

Proxy Voting Procedures


Proxy Voting Committees

Our growth and value investment groups have formed separate proxy voting
committees to establish general proxy policies for Alliance Capital and consider
specific proxy voting matters as necessary. These committees periodically review
new types of corporate governance issues, evaluate proposals not covered by
these policies and recommend how we should generally vote on such issues. In
addition, the committees, in conjunction with the analyst that covers the
company, contact management and interested shareholder groups as necessary to
discuss proxy issues. Members of the committees include senior investment
personnel and representatives of the Corporate Legal Department. The committees
may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential conflict of interest (as
discussed below). Finally, the committees monitor adherence to guidelines,
industry trends and review the policies contained in this statement from time to
time.


Conflicts of Interest

Alliance Capital recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest
when we vote a proxy solicited by an issuer whose retirement plan we manage,
whose retirement plan we administer, or with whom we have another business or
personal relationship that may affect how we vote on the issuer's proxy. We
believe that centralized management of proxy voting, oversight by the proxy
voting committees and adherence to these policies ensures that proxies are voted
with only our clients' best interests in mind. That said, we have implemented
additional procedures to ensure that our votes are not the product of a conflict
of interests, including: (i) requiring anyone involved in the decision making
process to disclose to the chairman of the appropriate proxy committee any
potential conflict that they are aware of and any contact that they have had
with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; (ii) prohibiting employees
involved in the decision making process or vote administration from revealing
how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence
from interested parties; and (iii) where a material conflict of interests
exists, reviewing our proposed vote by applying a series of objective tests and,
where necessary, considering the views of a third party research service to
ensure that our voting decision is consistent with our clients' best interests.
For example, if our proposed vote is consistent with our stated proxy voting
policy, no further review is necessary. If our proposed vote is contrary to our
stated proxy voting policy but is also contrary to management's recommendation,
no further review is necessary. If our proposed vote is contrary to our stated
proxy voting policy or is not covered by our policy, is consistent with
management's recommendation, and is also consistent with the views of an
independent source, no further review is necessary. If our proposed vote is
contrary to our stated proxy voting policy or is not covered by our policy, is
consistent with management's recommendation and is contrary to the views of an
independent source, the proposal is reviewed by the appropriate proxy committee
for final determination.


Proxies of Certain Non-US Issuers

Proxy voting in certain countries requires "share blocking." Shareholders
wishing to vote their proxies must deposit their shares shortly before the date
of the meeting (usually one-week) with a designated depositary. During this
blocking period, shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be sold until
the meeting has taken place and the shares are returned to the clients'
custodian banks. Alliance Capital may determine that the value of exercising the
vote does not outweigh the detriment of not being able to transact in the shares
during this period. Accordingly, if share blocking is required we may abstain
from voting those shares. In such a situation we would have determined that the
cost of voting exceeds the expected benefit to the client.


Proxy Voting Records

Clients may obtain information about how we voted proxies on their behalf by
contacting their Alliance Capital administrative representative. Alternatively,
clients may make a written request for proxy voting information to: Mark R.
Manley, Senior Vice President & Assistant General Counsel, Alliance Capital
Management L.P., 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10105.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

         The AllianceBernstein Mutual Fund Complex's code of ethics (this
"Code") for the investment companies within the complex (collectively, the
"Funds" and each, a "Company") applies to each Company's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer and Controller (the "Covered
Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:


o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
     relationships;
o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
     documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and
     Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
     Company;
o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;
o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
     person or persons identified in the Code; and
o    accountability for adherence to the Code.


         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
    Interest

         Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his position with the Company. For the purposes of this Code, members of the
Covered Officer's family include his or her spouse, children, stepchildren,
financial dependents, parents and stepparents.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The Company's and the
investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent,
or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and
is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such
conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and
the Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Company's Board of Directors or Trustees (the "Directors") that the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more of the other Funds or
of other investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

         Each Covered Officer must:
o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
     influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Company
     whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
     the Company;
o    not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
     individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
     of the Company;
o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
     contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to trade
     personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions;


          There are some conflict of interest situations, whether involving a
Covered Officer directly or a member of his family, that should always be
discussed with the General Counsel of AllianceBernstein Investment Research and
Management, Inc.(the "General Counsel"), if material. Examples of these include:

o    service as a director on the board of directors or trustees of any public
     or private company (other than a not-for-profit organization);
o    the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;
o    the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Company
     has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
     business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and
     not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;
o    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
     with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
     adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
     thereof;
o    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
     or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio transactions or for
     selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Covered
     Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.


III. Disclosure and Compliance

o    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
     requirements and disclosure controls and procedures generally applicable to
     the Company;
o    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
     misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside
     the Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors, and to
     governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;
o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
     responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and
     the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
     understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with,
     or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds;
     and
o    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with
     the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
     regulations.


IV. Reporting and Accountability

     Each Covered Officer must:
o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
     Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the General Counsel that he has
     received, read, and understands the Code;
o    annually thereafter affirm to the General Counsel that he has complied with
     the requirements of the Code;
o    complete at least annually a questionnaire relating to affiliations or
     other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest;
o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
     Company or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
     that are made in good faith; and
o    notify the General Counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of this
     Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by a
Covered Officer will be considered by the Company's Audit Committee (the
"Committee").

         The Company will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:
o    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
     potential violations reported to him;
o    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
     material violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to
     take any further action;
o    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a material violation will
     be reported to the Committee;
o    if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it will
     inform and make a recommendation to the Directors, who will consider
     appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
     modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
     appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
     recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;
o    the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and
o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
     disclosed as provided by SEC rules.



V. Other Policies and Procedures

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Company for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Company, the Company's adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, it is
understood that this Code is in all respects separate and apart from, and
operates independently of, any such policies and procedures.. In particular, the
Company's and its investment adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.


VI. Amendments

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Directors, including a
majority of independent directors.


VII. Confidentiality

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Directors, the investment
adviser, their counsel, counsel to the Company and, if deemed appropriate by the
Directors of the Company, to the Directors of the other Funds.


VIII. Internal Use

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
