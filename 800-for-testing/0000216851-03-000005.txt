                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation's investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its
investment transactions are set forth in the Corporation's registration
statement.

Security Valuation--Investments in securities traded on national security
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions and Investment Income--Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities, including options, at June 30, 2003 was $335,668,460, and net
unrealized appreciation aggregated $146,307,231, of which the related gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $176,102,378 and $29,795,147,
respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Corporation's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

3.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $9,346,377 and
$28,301,885, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the market risk of
an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written
option. The risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium
originally paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2003
can be found on page 10.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2003 were as follows:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The cost of the 213,200 shares of Common Stock held by the Corporation at June
30, 2003 and of the 14,900 shares of Common Stock held at December 31, 2002
amounted to $4,165,909 and $285,217 on each respective date.

The Corporation has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 895,522 shares of the Corporation's Common
Stock at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are
exercisable beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend
and vest over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and
extend over the period during which the option is exercisable. The stock
appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise
their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the Common Stock at the
date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by
the Corporation during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2003, there were
152,012 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $18.0662
per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Corporation granted
options including stock appreciation rights for 21,258 shares of Common Stock
with an exercise price of $19.285. During the six months ended June 30, 2003,
stock appreciation rights relating to 10,514 stock option shares were exercised
at a weighted average market price of $20.0289 per share and the stock options
relating to these rights with a weighted average exercise price of $10.6666 per
share were cancelled. Stock options and stock appreciation rights relating to
25,943 shares, with a weighted average exercise price of $19.4609, were
cancelled. At June 30, 2003, there were outstanding exercisable options to
purchase 46,232 common shares at $9.0317-$25.2538 per share (weighted average
price of $17.3058) and unexercisable options to purchase 90,581 common shares
at $11.6367-$25.2538 per share (weighted average price of $19.0276). The
weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding exercisable and
unexercisable options was 5.0377 years and 6.6797 years, respectively. The
total compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights
recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $99,616. At June 30,
2003, there were 279,614 shares available for future option grants.

5.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation provides retirement benefits for its employees under a
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based
on years of service and compensation during the last five years of employment.
The Corporation's current funding policy is to contribute annually to the plan
only those amounts that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. As of
June 30, 2003, the plan assets, consisting primarily of investments in
individual stocks, bonds and mutual funds were $3,349,405. In determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation, the interest rate
used for the weighted average discount rate was 6.75%, the expected rate of
annual salary increases was 7.0%, and the long-term expected rate of return on
plan assets was 8.0%. The projected benefit obligation as of June 30, 2003 was
$3,854,538. Prepaid pension cost included in other assets at June 30, 2003 was
$900,956.

In addition, the Corporation has a nonqualified benefit plan which provides
employees with defined retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan.
The Corporation does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6.  EXPENSES

The cumulative amount of accrued expenses at June 30, 2003 for employees and
former employees of the Corporation was $1,052,222. Aggregate remuneration paid
or accrued during the six months ended June 30, 2003 to key employees and
directors amounted to $655,563.

7.  PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues
to receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are
secured at all times by collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the
securities loaned plus accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of
securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will be for the
account of the Corporation. At June 30, 2003, the Corporation had securities on
loan of $5,857,056 and held collateral of $6,207,374, consisting of repurchase
agreements.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at June 30, 2003, and the results
of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights
for each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at June 30, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
