1.       ORGANIZATION

         UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability
         company  under the laws of Delaware  on August 13,  2001 and  commenced
         operations  on  February  1,  2003.  The Fund is  registered  under the
         Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940  Act"),  as a
         closed-end, non-diversified,  management investment company. The Fund's
         investment   objective  is  to  seek  capital   appreciation  over  the
         long-term.  The Fund is a multi-manager  fund that seeks to achieve its
         objective  by  deploying  its assets  among a select group of portfolio
         managers who primarily employ long/short equity  strategies,  including
         those involving  foreign issuers.  Generally,  such portfolio  managers
         conduct their investment programs through unregistered investment funds
         (collectively,  the "Investment Funds"), in which the Fund invests as a
         limited partner, member or shareholder along with other investors.

         The  Fund's  Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has  overall
         responsibility  to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
         including the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish policies
         regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
         The  Directors  have engaged UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the
         "Adviser"  and,  when  providing   services  under  the  Administration
         Agreement, the "Administrator"),  a Delaware limited liability company,
         to provide  investment  advice  regarding  the  selection of Investment
         Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

         The Adviser is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
         which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered as an
         investment  adviser  under  the  Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940,  as
         amended.

         Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors
         may be  accepted at such times as the  Adviser  may  determine  and are
         generally  accepted monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to reject any
         application for interests in the Fund.

         The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant
         to written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such
         times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their
         complete and exclusive discretion.  Members can only transfer or assign
         their membership interests or a portion thereof (i) by operation of law
         pursuant  to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  dissolution  of a
         Member,  or (ii) with the written approval of the Directors,  which may
         be withheld in their sole and absolute  discretion.  Such transfers may
         be made even if the balance of the capital  account to such  transferee
         is equal to or less than the transferor's initial capital contribution.

                                                                               6

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Fund adopted the  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
         157  FAIR  VALUE  MEASUREMENTS  ("FAS  157").  FAS 157  establishes  an
         authoritative  definition  of fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for
         measuring fair value, and requires  additional  disclosures  about fair
         value  measurements.  Under FAS 157, fair value is the price that would
         be  received  to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a  liability  in an
         orderly  transaction  between market  participants  at the  measurement
         date.

         Various  inputs  are used in  determining  the fair value of the Fund's
         investments  relating to FAS 157.  These inputs are  summarized  in the
         three broad levels listed below.

         LEVEL 1--quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.
         LEVEL 2--other  significant  observable inputs (including quoted prices
         for similar  securities,  interest rates,  prepayment  spreads,  credit
         risk, etc.)
         LEVEL 3--significant  unobservable  inputs  (including  the Fund's  own
         assumptions in determining the fair value of investments.)

         Financial  Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") Staff Position  ("FSP")
         157-4 was issued on April 9, 2009. It provides  additional guidance for
         estimating  fair value in accordance  with FAS 157, when the volume and
         level  of  activity  for the  asset  or  liability  have  significantly
         decreased  and  provides  guidance on  identifying  circumstances  that
         indicate  a  transaction  is not  orderly.  This FSP also  expands  the
         quantitative   disclosures   required  by  FAS  157.   For  assets  and
         liabilities  measured  at fair value on a  recurring  basis  during the
         period, this FSP requires quantitative disclosures about the fair value
         measurements   separately   for  each  major  category  of  assets  and
         liabilities,  as well  as a  reconciliation  of  beginning  and  ending
         balances  of  Level 3  assets  and  liabilities  broken  down by  major
         category.  "Major  category"  is  defined  as major  security  types as
         described in FSP FAS 115-2. As a result,  the Fund shall now include in
         its FAS 157 tables the following major security types (noted in FSP FAS
         115-2), though additional types may also be necessary:

            a.  Equity securities (segregated by industry type, company size, or
                investment objective)
            b.  Debt  securities  issued by the U.S.  Treasury  and  other  U.S.
                government corporations and agencies
            c.  Debt  securities  issued  by  states of the  United  States  and
                political subdivisions of the states
            d.  Debt securities issued by foreign governments
            e.  Corporate debt securities
            f.  Residential mortgage-backed securities
            g.  Commercial mortgage-backed securities
            h.  Collateralized debt obligations
            i.  Other debt obligations

                                                                               7

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         A  detailed  depiction  of the  portfolio  broken  down  into the above
         mentioned  FAS 157  levels  can be found in the  tables  following  the
         Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

         Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
         Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal  period in
         accordance  with the valuation  principles set forth below or as may be
         determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the
         Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to
         the terms and  conditions of the  respective  operating  agreements and
         offering   memoranda,   as  appropriate.   The  Fund's  investments  in
         Investment  Funds are carried at fair  value.  All  valuations  utilize
         financial  information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of
         management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
         Investment  Funds'  managers  or  pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'
         agreements.  The Fund's  valuation  procedures  require  the Adviser to
         consider all relevant information available at the time the Fund values
         its  portfolio.  The Adviser has assessed  factors  including,  but not
         limited to the individual  Investment  Funds'  compliance with FAS 157,
         price transparency and valuation procedures in place,  subscription and
         redemption  activity,  level  of  illiquid  securities  held,  and  the
         existence or absence of certain  redemption  restrictions.  The Adviser
         and/or the  Directors  will  consider  such  information  and  consider
         whether it is appropriate,  in light of all relevant circumstances,  to
         value such a position  at its net asset value as reported or whether to
         adjust such value.  The underlying  investments of each Investment Fund
         are accounted for at fair value as described in each Investment  Fund's
         financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

         The fair value of the Fund's  assets and  liabilities  which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  FAIR  VALUE  OF  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS,
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         B.    INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

         The Fund accounts for realized  gains and losses from  Investment  Fund
         transactions  based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of
         the underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income is
         recorded on the accrual basis.

         C.    FUND EXPENSES

         The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but
         not  limited  to,  the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to
         portfolio  transactions  and  positions for the Fund's  account;  legal
         fees;  accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing

         C.    FUND EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

         including  travel  and  related  expenses;   expenses  of  meetings  of
         Directors  and  Members;  all costs with respect to  communications  to
         Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

         D.    INCOME TAXES

         The Fund has  reclassified  $6,828,270 and $12,941,573 from accumulated
         net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on investments,
         respectively,  to net capital contributions during the six month period
         ended  June  30,  2009.  The  reclassification  was to  reflect,  as an
         adjustment to net contributions, the amount of estimated taxable income
         or loss that have been  allocated to the Fund's  Members as of June 30,
         2009 and had no effect on net assets.

         The Fund is subject to the provisions of FASB  Interpretation  48 ("FIN
         48"), ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. This standard defines
         the threshold for recognizing  the benefits of tax-return  positions in
         the financial statements as  "more-likely-than-not"  to be sustained by
         the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting
         the more-likely-than-not  criterion,  based on the largest benefit that
         is more than 50 percent likely to be realized.  Management has analyzed
         the Fund's tax  positions  taken on federal  income tax returns for all
         open tax  years  (tax  years  ended  December  31,  2004-2007)  and the
         positions to be taken for the federal income tax return to be filed for
         the  tax  year  ended  December  31,  2008  and has  concluded  that no
         provision   for  income  tax  is  required  in  the  Fund's   financial
         statements. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related
         to unrecognized  tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of
         Operations.  During the period  ended June 30,  2009,  the Fund did not
         incur any interest or penalties.

         Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return
         its distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

         E.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
         account  which pays money  market rates and are  accounted  for at cost
         plus accrued  interest which is included in interest  receivable on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         F.    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

         From time to time the Fund may enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
         connection  with such  transactions  it is the Fund's  policy that PFPC
         Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA), (the  "Custodian")  take
         possession of the underlying collateral  securities,  the fair value of
         which  exceeds  the  principal  amount of the  repurchase  transaction,
         including accrued interest, at all times. If the

                                                                               9

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         F.    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (CONTINUED)

         seller  defaults,  and  the  fair  value  of the  collateral  declines,
         realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. As
         of June 30, 2009, there were no outstanding repurchase agreements.

         G.    USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Fund's financial statements are
         reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these
         estimates.

3.       RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Adviser provides  investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant
         to an Investment  Manager  Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement,  the
         Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the  "Investment  Management Fee")
         at the annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets
         attributable to the Adviser and the Administrator.

         The Administrator provides certain administrative services to the Fund,
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services.  In  consideration  for  such  services,  the  Fund  pays the
         Administrator a monthly fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of
         0.30% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding  assets  attributable to the
         Administrator's  and the Adviser's capital account.  The Management Fee
         and the Investment Management Fee will be paid to the Administrator and
         Adviser  out of the Fund's  assets and  debited  against  the  Members'
         capital   accounts,   excluding   net   assets   attributable   to  the
         Administrator's  and the Adviser's  capital  account.  A portion of the
         Investment  Management  Fee and the  Management Fee is paid by UBSFA to
         its affiliates.

         UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
         UBS Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without
         special  compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated
         with its activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if any, charged
         on  contributions  are debited  against the  contribution  amounts,  to
         arrive  at a net  subscription  amount.  The  placement  fee  does  not
         constitute assets of the Fund.

         The  net  increase  or  decrease  in  Members'   capital  derived  from
         operations (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of
         all Members on a pro-rata basis,  other than the Investment  Management
         Fee and the Management Fee which are similarly allocated to all Members
         other than the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

                                                                              10

3.      RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

         Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a
         fee for each meeting  attended.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors
         and the Chairman of the Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors each
         receive an  additional  annual  retainer  in the amounts of $10,000 and
         $15,000,  respectively.  These  additional  annual retainer amounts are
         paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata basis with ten other UBS funds where
         UBSFA is the  investment  adviser.  All Directors are reimbursed by the
         Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses.  Total amounts expensed
         by the Fund related to Directors for the period from January 1, 2009 to
         June 30, 2009 were $26,089 which is included in other expenses.

         Other  investment   partnerships  sponsored  by  UBS  Americas  or  its
         affiliates  may also maintain  investment  interests in the  Investment
         Funds owned by the Fund.

4.       ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

         PNC Global Investment  Servicing (U.S.),  Inc. ("PNC"), a member of The
         PNC  Financial  Services  Group,  Inc.,  serves as  Administrative  and
         Accounting  Agent to the Fund,  and in that capacity  provides  certain
         administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax and Member  related
         services.  PNC  receives  a monthly  fee  primarily  based upon (i) the
         average net assets of the Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly  fee, and
         (ii) the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain other  investment
         funds  sponsored or advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc. or its  affiliates.
         Additionally,  the  Fund  reimburses  certain  out of  pocket  expenses
         incurred by PNC.

         The Custodian of the Fund's assets provides  custodial services for the
         Fund.

5.       INVESTMENTS

         As of June 30, 2009, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
         of which were related parties.

         Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of Investment Funds for the
         period from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009,  amounted to  $28,188,324
         and $199,742,222, respectively.

         The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
         items of  taxable  income  allocated  to the Fund  from the  Investment
         Funds.  The  allocated  taxable  income is  reported to the Fund by the
         Investment Funds on Schedule K-1. The tax basis of investments for 2009
         will not be finalized by the Fund until after the fiscal year end.

         The agreements  related to investments in Investment  Funds provide for
         compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
         fees of between 1.00% and 2.50% (per annum) of net

                                                                              11

5.       INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

         assets and  performance  incentive  fees and  allocations  ranging from
         16.50% to 25.00% of net profits  earned.  One or more  underlying  fund
         investments have entered into a side pocket arrangement.

6.       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the normal  course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the
         Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
         investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but
         are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
         contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
         these Investment Funds is limited to the value of these investments.

7.       INDEMNIFICATION

         In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts
         or  agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future
         events  could  occur  that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions
         against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels
         that the likelihood of such an event is remote.

8.       SUBSEQUENT EVENT

         As of June 30, 2009, the Fund had $118,035,962 of withdrawals  payable.
         On July 16, 2009,  the Fund paid  $106,474,942.  The  remaining  amount
         payable of $11,561,020  is scheduled to be paid in accordance  with the
         terms of the Fund's June 30, 2009 tender offer.

         Management  has  evaluated the impact of all  subsequent  events on the
         Fund through  August 25, 2009, the date the financial  statements  were
         issued,  and has  determined  that there were no additional  subsequent
         events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

                                                                              12
