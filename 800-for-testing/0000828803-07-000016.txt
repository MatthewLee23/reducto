                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management groups--
                            Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that
                            has helped us become one of the most trusted names
                            in financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the 12 months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +8.63% based on market price and +10.58% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of +2.33% in local currency terms
and +5.77% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period.1 You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

In spite of a weaker U.S. housing market and moderating U.S. economic growth,
the global economy remained robust for the year under review. The U.S. Federal
Reserve Board (Fed) kept the federal funds target rate at 5.25% throughout the
period, while central banks in Europe and Asia increased rates due to strong
growth conditions and underlying inflation pressures. Amid this global backdrop,
international treasury yield curves outside the U.S. broadly steepened and the
U.S. dollar weakened against its major trading partners. Volatility rose across
asset classes near period-end, as losses originating from the U.S. subprime
mortgage market triggered a liquidity squeeze in money markets. Central banks
injected liquidity into the banking system to stabilize financial markets and
investors' flight to quality drove long-term yields lower. Notably, emerging
market countries were generally in a stronger position than during prior periods
of tightening liquidity conditions given their significant foreign reserve
accumulation and supportive economic policies.

The Fed cut the discount rate 50 basis points (100 basis points equal one
percentage point) in August in reaction to bank funding concerns, but, as
mentioned above, did not change the federal funds target rate during the period.
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from annualized rates of 3.2% in
second quarter 2006 to 1.9% in second quarter 2007 due to contraction in
residential investment and moderating corporate and consumer spending. In
addition, data released near period-end indicated the labor market may be
softening. Although inflation remained a medium-term concern, the housing market
correction and financial market volatility posed more immediate risks to growth
and raised expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates. Encouragingly, U.S.
exports continued to grow at double-digit rates, suggesting global growth

remained strong. However, the U.S. trade deficit remained large at $59 billion
in July 2007. 2 Additionally, the U.S. trade deficit with Asia widened to record
levels.

In Asia, the widening trade surplus corresponded with continued accumulation of
foreign reserves by Asian central banks. For example, China accumulated $361
billion in foreign reserves from the beginning of the period through June 2007
for a total of $1.333 trillion. 3 Asian economies also maintained stronger
economic growth relative to the U.S. China led the region, posting 11.9%
annualized year-over-year GDP growth in second quarter 2007, followed by India
(9.3%), Singapore (8.6%), Malaysia (5.7%) and South Korea (5.0%). 4 Strong
growth and higher food, housing, stock and other asset prices contributed to
inflationary pressures. Some countries, including China, India and South Korea,
sought a more appropriate policy mix between interest rates and currency
appreciation to curb inflation. As a result, the central banks of China, India
and South Korea hiked interest rates 90, 75 and 50 basis points, respectively.

In Europe, interest rate tightening was more aggressive. For example, the
European Central Bank, the U.K. and Sweden each hiked rates 100 basis points,
while Norway and Poland raised rates 175 and 75 basis points. Eurozone
unemployment dropped to 6.9%, the lowest rate since the introduction of the euro
as a common currency in 1999. 5 European labor markets tightened and also became
more dynamic, with increased movement of labor from central and eastern Europe
to western Europe. Wage pressure in western Europe remained contained, but labor
shortages in Scandinavia and central Europe contributed to wage growth in those
areas. In second quarter 2007, eurozone GDP grew 2.5% year-over-year and
continued to provide support to other European economies given the region's high
integration through trade. 5 GDP for Poland, the Norwegian mainland and Sweden
grew 6.7%, 5.8% and 3.5%, respectively. 5,6

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.

WHAT IS DURATION?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes. In
general, a portfolio of securities with a lower duration can be expected to be
less sensitive to interest rate changes than a portfolio with a higher duration.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

During the year under review, the overall duration of the Fund's portfolio
remained relatively short amid a backdrop of strong global growth rates and
rising interest rates. Among developed markets, this positioning generated mixed
results. Short duration positioning in Europe benefited relative performance due
to an increase in long-term treasury yields. In Germany, the 10-year yield rose
47 basis points to 4.26% during the year under review. Conversely, the Fund's
lack of exposure to the U.S. Treasury market detracted from relative
performance, given the U.S. yield curve's downward shift over the period.
Despite rising interest rates globally, we continued to find interest rate
opportunities in select markets. For example, exposure to Brazil and Indonesia,
which reduced interest rates 275 and 350 basis points during the period, aided
relative performance. Brazil's bond market returned +15.95% in local currency
terms, as measured by the JPM Global Bond Index - Emerging Markets (GBI-EM)
Broad and Indonesia's bond market returned +19.98% in local currency terms, as
measured by the HSBC Asian Local Bond Index (ALBI). 7

CURRENCY STRATEGY

The Fund's diversified currency exposure benefited relative performance. We
maintained our currency strategy over the past year, positioning for the gradual
unwinding of global imbalances that would benefit other currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar. The U.S. current account deficit remained large at 5.5% of GDP
in the second quarter of 2007 and was vulnerable to reassessment of risk by
foreign buyers as the deficit had been funded by short-term capital flows into
U.S. fixed income securities. 2 Additionally, the sources of global growth
continued to be dominated by the Asian region, which we believed were likely to
support their currencies versus the U.S. dollar over the medium term. The U.S.
dollar weakened 4.63% against its major trading partners in the 12-month period,
partly due to the 4.91% appreciation of the Canadian dollar. 8 Exposure to the
Brazilian real was a significant contributor to relative performance in the
period, as it appreciated 8.97% against the U.S. dollar. 9

4 | Annual Report



In Asia, the Fund's basket of non-Japan currencies generated positive returns.
The Thai baht (sold by period-end) appreciated 15.67% against the U.S. dollar,
the Indian rupee 13.85%, the Malaysian ringgit 5.13% and the South Korean won
2.48%. 9 The Japanese yen lagged other Asian currencies throughout the period,
but appreciated 1.18%. 9 The yen was one of the Fund's single largest currencies
represented among a diversified portfolio. We continued to find yen valuations
attractive and saw the potential for the difference between Japan's interest
rates and those of other major economies to narrow as the nation's structural
improvements continued to take hold and U.S. interest rates came down.

In Europe, the euro appreciated 6.50% and touched an all-time high against the
U.S. dollar. 9 We continued to prefer exposure to some non-euro European
currencies given better valuations and growth dynamics. During the period, the
Polish zloty and Norwegian krone appreciated 9.82% and 8.29% against the U.S.
dollar and boosted the Fund's relative performance. 9 The Swedish krona
appreciated 5.01% against the U.S. dollar, but lagged the euro. 9 The
combination of overweighted exposure to the krona and underweighted exposure to
the euro detracted from relative performance during the period. The Slovak
koruna appreciated 19.04% versus the U.S. dollar, supported by revaluation of
its currency and improved prospects for joining the eurozone in 2009. 9
Additionally, Romania's entrance into the European Union at the beginning of
2007 helped its currency appreciate 15.02% against the U.S. dollar. 9

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also invested in investment-grade and subinvestment-grade sovereign
debt. As an asset class, these investments typically compensate for greater
credit risk by offering higher yields relative to U.S. and European benchmark
treasury yield curves. U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt generated a
12-month return of +5.71% as measured by the JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index
Global (EMBIG). 10 Sovereign interest rate spreads rose from 197 basis points at
the beginning of the reporting period to 235 basis points by period-end, spurred
by financial market contagion from the U.S. subprime mortgage woes. 10 The Fund
had limited exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt given
valuations, but we noted that credit fundamentals have significantly improved
over the past few years, as shown by reserve accumulation, more supportive
economic policies and improved debt ratios. Regionally, Asian sovereign debt
returned +6.74%, central and eastern European +6.66%, African +6.62%, Latin
American +5.15% and Middle Eastern +2.39% in U.S. dollar terms. 10

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. The investment manager monitors price movements
following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of
country specific market proxies (such as baskets of American Depository
Receipts, futures contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements
are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market
proxy to assist in determining if an event has occurred. If such an event
occurs, the securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may
include the use of independent pricing services. All security valuation
procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.


                                                              Annual Report | 19

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences
may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among
capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no
impact on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases in
the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by amounts
corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments, including
adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest income.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

9. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 20.52% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

10. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

11. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares ("marketing support"), Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"),
entered into settlements with certain of those regulators and governmental
entities. Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among
others, concerning market timing and marketing support.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

11. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS (CONTINUED)

On June 23, 2006, the SEC approved the proposed plan of distribution for the
marketing support settlement, and disbursement of the settlement monies to the
designated funds, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that settlement
and plan, was completed in September 2006. The Fund did not participate in that
settlement.

On June 6, 2007, the SEC posted for public comment the proposed plan of
distribution for the market timing settlement. Following the public comment
period, and once the SEC approves the final plan of distribution, disbursements
of settlement monies will be made promptly to individuals who were shareholders
of the designated funds during the relevant period, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the settlement and plan.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above.

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition,
classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the
related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
date of effectiveness. On December 22, 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission extended the implementation date to no later than the last net asset
value calculation in the first semiannual reporting period beginning after
December 15, 2006. The Fund believes the adoption of FIN 48 will have no
material impact on its financial statements.

In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement"
("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Fund believes the adoption of SFAS 157
will have no material impact on its financial statements.

Templeton Global Income Fund

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Global Income Fund (the
"Fund") at August 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at August
31, 2007 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

Under Section 871(k)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $877,570 as interest
related dividends for purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871 (a)(1)(A) of
the Code for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007.

At August 31, 2007, more than 50% of the Templeton Global Income Fund's total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from dividends paid to the Fund on these
investments. As shown in the table below, the Fund designates to shareholders
the foreign source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the
Internal Revenue Code. This designation will allow shareholders of record on
August 17, 2007, to treat their proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the
Fund as having been paid directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these
amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund
distribution.

The following tables provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by
the Fund to Class A shareholders of record.

Templeton Global Income Fund

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a minimum of 16
days during the 31-day period beginning 15 days before the ex-dividend date of
the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate), or, as a tax
deduction.

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income. 1

Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. 1

In January 2008, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2007. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2007 individual income
tax returns.

1 Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in the
10% and 15% income tax bracket). In determining the amount of foreign tax credit
that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of individuals receiving
foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may be required to the foreign
tax credit limitation calculation to reflect the rate differential applicable to
such dividend income. The rules however permit certain individuals to elect not
to apply the rate differential adjustments for capital gains and/or dividends
for any taxable year. Please consult your tax advisor and the instructions to
Form 1116 for more information.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to Mellon
Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a
maximum of $5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her
account. These payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon
Bank, N.A." and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh,
PA, 15252-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator
shall apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share
of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box
358035, Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8035. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held May 22, 2007, the Board of Trustees (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for the Fund. In reaching this decision, the
Board took into account information furnished throughout the year at regular
Board meetings, as well as information prepared specifically in connection with
the annual renewal review process. Information furnished and discussed
throughout the year included investment performance reports and related
financial information for the Fund, as well as periodic reports on shareholder
services, legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates.
Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process
included a report for the Fund prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent
organization, as well as a Fund profitability analysis report prepared by
management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's investment performance and
expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable to the Fund as selected by
Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report discussed the profitability to
Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall U.S. fund operations, as well as
on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included with such profitability analysis
report was information on a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and
other accounts they manage, as well as information on management fees charged by
the Manager and its affiliates including management's explanation of differences
where relevant and a three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any
increase in expense ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a
memorandum prepared by management describing project initiatives and capital
investments relating to the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin
Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to
economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's continuous
efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures
to function in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted that such systems
and procedures had

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

functioned smoothly during the Florida hurricanes and blackouts experienced in
recent years. Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's
portfolio management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of a portfolio manager's bonus compensation was the
relative investment performance of the funds he or she managed and that a
portion of such bonus was required to be invested in a predesignated list of
funds within such person's fund management area so as to be aligned with the
interests of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement
renewals. The Lipper report for the Fund showed its investment performance for
the one-year period ended February 28, 2007, as well as the previous 10 years
ended that date in respect to a performance universe consisting of the Fund and
all other closed-end global income funds as selected by Lipper. Such report
considered both the Fund's income return and total return on a net asset value
basis without regard to market discounts or premiums to accurately reflect
investment performance. The Lipper report showed that the Fund's income return
for the one-year period was the highest in such group, and on an annualized
basis for the previous three- and five-year periods was in the highest and
second-highest quintiles, respectively, of such group, and in lowest quintile
for the previous 10-year period, while its total return was in the highest
quintile of such group for the one-year period, and, on an annualized basis, was
in the highest quintile of such group for each of the previous three- and
10-year periods, and in the second-highest quintile for the previous five-year
period. The Board was satisfied with such comparative performance.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a Lipper
selected expense group consisting of the Fund and the three other closed-end
funds comprising the closed-end fund group referred to in the discussion of
investment performance. Prior to making such comparison, the Board relied upon a
survey showing that the scope of management advisory services covered under the
Fund's investment management agreement was similar to those provided by fund
managers to other fund groups that would be used as a basis of comparison in the
Lipper reports. In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was given to the Fund's
contractual investment management fee in comparison with the contractual
investment management fee that would have been charged by the other funds within
the Lipper expense group assuming they were similar in size to the Fund, as well
as the actual total expenses of the Fund in comparison with those of the other
funds. The Lipper contractual investment management fee analysis considers
administrative fees to be part of management fees and the results of such
expense comparison showed both the Fund's contractual investment management fee
rate and total actual expenses to be the lowest of such group. The Board was
satisfied with the Fund's comparative management fee and expenses.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund. Specific attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating
costs to the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies are
inherently subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be
reasonable while producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted
that, while being continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's
own cost accounting, the allocation methodology was consistent with that
followed in profitability report presentations for the Fund made in prior years
and that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm had been
engaged by the Manager to perform certain procedures on a biennial basis,
specified and approved by the Manager and the Fund's Board solely for their
purposes and use in reference to the profitability analysis. In reviewing and
discussing such analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that
costs incurred in establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of fund
operations conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully
reflected in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its
profitability, as well as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain
extent, reflected operational costs savings and efficiencies initiated by
management. The Board also took into account management's expenditures in
improving shareholder services provided the Fund, as well as the need to meet
additional regulatory and compliance requirements resulting from the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and recent SEC requirements. In addition, the Board
considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the Manager's
parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers broken
down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution
expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses. The Board
also considered the extent to which the Manager and its affiliates might derive
ancillary benefits from fund operations. Based upon its consideration of all
these factors, the Board determined that the level of profits realized by the
Manager and its affiliates from providing services to each Fund was not
excessive in view of the nature, quality and extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
Manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders. In this respect, the Board
noted the Fund is charged a management advisory fee and administrative fee at
the combined rate of 0.70% on its first $200 million of net assets;


                                                              Annual Report | 39

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

0.635% on the next $500 million of net assets; 0.60% on the next $300 million of
net assets; and 0.58% on the next $4 billion of net assets with decreasing
breakpoints continuing through the $20 billion net asset level, and at the
Fund's asset size at year-end of approximately $1.2 billion, such fee schedule
provides a sharing of benefits with the Fund and its shareholders.

the Fund uses to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities.

for which these fees were paid included tax compliance and advice.

(d)  All Other Fees

The aggregate fees paid to the principal accountant for products and services
rendered by the principal accountant to the registrant not reported in
paragraphs (a)-(c) of Item 4 were $0 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007
and $639 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006. The services for which these
fees were paid included review of materials provided to the fund Board in
connection with the investment management contract renewal process.

The aggregate fees paid to the principal accountant for products and services
rendered by the principal accountant to the registrant's investment adviser and
any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant not reported
in paragraphs (a)-(c) of Item 4 were $0 for the fiscal year ended August 31,
2007 and $175,222 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006. The services for
which these fees were paid included review of materials provided to the fund
Board in connection with the investment management contract renewal process.

(e) (1) The registrant's audit committee is directly responsible for approving
the services to be provided by the auditors, including:

     (i) pre-approval of all audit and audit related services;

     (ii) pre-approval of all non-audit related services to be provided to
the Fund by the auditors;

     (iii) pre-approval of all non-audit related services to be provided to
the registrant by the auditors to the registrant's investment adviser or to any
entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the
registrant's investment adviser and that provides ongoing services to the
registrant where the non-audit services relate directly to the operations or
financial reporting of the registrant; and

     (iv) establishment by the audit committee, if deemed necessary or
appropriate, as an alternative to committee pre-approval of services to be
provided by the auditors, as required by paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above, of
policies and procedures to permit such services to be pre-approved by other
means, such as through establishment of guidelines or by action of a designated
member or members of the committee; provided the policies and procedures are
detailed as to the particular service and the committee is informed of each
service and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of audit

(h) The registrant's audit committee of the board has considered whether the
provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.  N/A


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
will refer the matter, along with the recommended course of action by the
manager to an interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include
portfolio managers and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for
evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the
voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another
independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy directly
to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. Where the
Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of trustees or a
committee of the board.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies online at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by
calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954/527-7678 or by sending a written
request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East Broward Boulevard, Suite
1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy Group. Copies of the Fund's
proxy voting records are available online at franklintempleton.com and posted on
the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV. The proxy voting records are updated each year
by August 31 to reflect the most recent 12-month period ended June 30.


ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANY
AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

(a)(1) As of October 30, 2007, the portfolio manager of the Fund is as follows:

MICHAEL HASENSTAB PH.D, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FRANKLIN ADVISERS, INC.

Mr. Hasenstab has been a manager of the Fund since 2002. He has final authority
over all aspects of the Fund's investment portfolio, including but not limited
to, purchases and sales of individual securities, portfolio risk assessment, and
the management of daily cash balances in accordance with anticipated management
requirements. The degree to which he may perform these functions, and the nature
of these functions, may change from time to time. He joined Franklin Templeton
Investments in 1995.

(a)(2) This section reflects information about the portfolio managers as of the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2007.

The following table shows the number of other accounts managed by each portfolio
manager and the total assets in the accounts managed within each category:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hasenstab
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual managers listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures helps to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. As noted above, the separate management of the trade
execution and valuation functions from the portfolio management process also
helps to reduce potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         Franklin Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and mutual fund shares (17.5%
         to 25%). The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to build a
         vested interest of the portfolio manager in the financial performance
         of both Franklin Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The
         bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
         compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving
         consistently strong investment performance, which aligns the financial
         incentives of the portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief
         Investment Officer of the manager and/or other officers of the manager,
         with responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of
         annual bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin
         Templeton guidelines. The following factors are generally used in
         determining bonuses under the plan:

         |X|  INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to the
              historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding
              years of all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The
              pre-tax performance of each fund managed is measured relative to a
              relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         |X|  NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative contributions of
              a portfolio manager to the manager's business and the investment
              management team, including professional knowledge, productivity,
              responsiveness to client needs and communication, are evaluated in
              determining the amount of any bonus award.

         |X|  RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of funds
              managed by the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's
              appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of Franklin Resources stock
         or restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds, and options
         to purchase common shares of Franklin Resources stock. Awards of such
         deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over time, so as to
         create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):


                                              Dollar Range of Fund
                                              Shares Beneficially
               Portfolio Manager                    Owned
         ----------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend
nominees to the Registrant's Board of Trustees that would require disclosure
herein.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

- -----------------------------
1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
