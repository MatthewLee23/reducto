                              PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or "the Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans. There can be no assurance that the Fund's
investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

MARKET RECAP

The six-month period ended November 30, 2007 was the most volatile period in the
senior secured floating-rate loan ("Senior Loan") market in recent years.
Despite record low default rates and minimal credit losses, the Senior Loan
benchmark index, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the "Index"), registered two
of its three worst months ever during the six-month period. 1 As described in
more detail below, this negative and volatile performance was primarily caused
by the spillover impact from the sub-prime crisis on technical conditions in the
Senior Loan market as opposed to fundamental credit erosion. As a reminder, most
Senior Loans have minimal direct exposure to sub-prime mortgage assets.

Credit spreads had been generally tightening from 2002 until June 2007.
Sustained double-digit earnings growth during four years of economic expansion
contributed to investors' increased comfort with credit risk. This resulted in a
dramatic increase in demand for Senior Loans which drove down credit spreads and
loosened credit terms. When the sub-prime crisis began in the spring, Senior
Loan credit spreads were near all-time low levels. In addition, the supply of
credit products was also reaching an all-time high as private equity firms
sought to take advantage of favorable credit markets with commercial and
investment banks all too eager to provide committed Senior Loan and high-yield
bond financing for record amounts of mergers and acquisitions on
borrower-friendly terms.

The record amount of Senior Loan supply coincided with a swift and severe
decline in demand for Senior Loans primarily as a result of the sub-prime
crisis. Structured, securitized investment products such as collateralized loan
obligations ("CLOs") have in recent years been the main buyers of Senior Loans.
Over the past five years, approximately 60% of all Senior Loans have been
purchased by CLOs. 2 Many CLO investors invest in a variety of securitized
products, including mortgages and sub-prime mortgages. Despite the fact that
CLOs continue to perform quite well, there has been a dramatic global reduction
in demand for all structured product assets, including CLOs. This increase in
supply and decrease in demand created an imbalance that has resulted in a
dramatic decline in Senior Loan prices.

The reduced demand by CLOs for Senior Loans was, until recently, being partially
made up for by non-traditional Senior Loan investors such as hedge funds,
distressed investors, dislocation funds and equity-income funds. However, many
of these investors may be approaching or have reached their investable limits in
Senior Loans. We believe that these investors will continue to have incremental
demand for loans and thereby improve technical conditions in the short term.
However, we also believe that compared to historical periods, the increased role
of these investors will result in higher volatility for the foreseeable future.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

FCT generated a total return of (14.86%) 3 including market price change and
dividends for the six-months ended November 30, 2007. The Fund's net asset value
("NAV") total return was (4.50%) 4 over the same period. The NAV return trailed
the Index return of (1.54%). The Fund's performance includes the negative impact
of leverage in a negative return environment as well as the negative impact of
fees, expenses, and un-invested cash balances which are not part of the
benchmark return. However, if there was a bright spot to the Fund's performance,
it came in the form of relative outperformance of its peers. FCT's NAV return
exceeded the peer group average of (5.12%), and the Fund was one of the top
performing "pure-play" funds 5 over the past six months as a result of its focus
on high credit quality versus some of it peers. The Fund's closing price on
November 30, 2007 was $15.34, which represented an 11.3% discount to its NAV,
compared to the Fund's discount to NAV of 0.5% six months earlier.

- -------------
1     Since its inception in 1997.

2     According to Standard & Poor's "A Guide to the Loan Market-October 2007."

3     Total return based on market value is the combination of reinvested
      dividend distributions and reinvested capital gains distributions, if any,
      at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in Common
      Share market price per share.

4     Total return based on NAV is the combination of reinvested dividend
      distributions and reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at
      prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in NAV per
      share and does not reflect sales load.

5     A smaller subset (FCM, FCT, PPR, TLI and VVR) of the broad peer group,
      which invest almost exclusively in senior loans. We refer to this smaller
      subset as the "pure-play" senior loan closed-end funds, and we believe
      that these funds are generally more comparable to FCT as the non-senior
      loan holdings are routinely less than 5% of the fund.

                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While credit spreads have widened significantly in the second half of 2007, the
underlying FCT portfolio is still made up primarily of Senior Loans purchased
during the last several years. The credit spreads on these Senior Loans are
generally below the spreads on Senior Loans which are being issued in the
current environment. As the Senior Loans in the Fund prepay, we will re-invest
the proceeds of these Senior Loans in newly issued Senior Loans that we expect
to be on better economic and structural terms than those which were issued prior
to the recent loan market correction.

The credit spread compression of recent years finally took its toll on the
Fund's dividend in September. The Fund, which had previously increased its
dividend 13 times, cut its dividend for the first time in October 2007 since its
inception in May 2004. The dividend distribution totaled $0.72 per Common Share
during the past six months, which represented a 5.3% decrease over the prior six
months ended May 31, 2007. Based on the Fund's current dividend, FCT's
distribution rate is 8.4% calculated on the Fund's share price and 7.5% based on
the Fund's NAV as of November 30, 2007, which was slightly lower than the pure
play peer group averages of 8.8% and 8.0%, respectively. The Fund saw its credit
spread decline by more than the market-wide spread decline, which we believe was
largely a result of our purposeful effort to avoid some of the wider spread and
higher risk Senior Loans that were being issued during the first half of the
year. This impacted dividends in the short-term, but should improve overall
performance in the long-term, in our opinion.

While we are disappointed with the Senior Loan market's heightened volatility
and poor market price performance, we do believe that the recent correction is
healthy and good for the market overall. Credit standards had been eroding
recently amid an excess of demand for Senior Loans compared to their supply, and
the correction has already resulted in new loans being issued on more favorable
economic and structural terms.

As discussed above, the Senior Loan market witnessed a marked increase in
volatility during the period covered by this report. The Fund's experience was
no different as both the Fund's price and NAV experienced unprecedented swings
and, at the end of the period, the Fund's discount to its NAV had widened to
near-record levels. During the period, the Fund's NAV fluctuated from a high of
$18.85 to a low of $17.25, a difference of $1.60 per Common Share, whereas the
market price of the Fund closed as high as $19.08 and as low as $14.81, a
difference of $4.27 per Common Share.

                                   MANAGER Q&A

WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL MARKET OUTLOOK?

We believe that a cyclical slowing of the U.S. economy is probable but a
recession in the near term is unlikely. In general, U.S. corporations have
healthy balance sheets and high cash positions, and continue to perform to plan.
Inflation remains moderate, employment remains strong and the U.S. economy is
boosted by strong growth overseas and an improved trade balance. These factors
support our belief of a continued below-average default rate environment of
Senior Loans over the next 12 months. While higher energy prices and ongoing
problems in the U.S. housing market will weigh most heavily on loans in real
estate, building materials, retail and automotive sectors, our economic outlook
is supportive of slower but still positive economic and earnings growth.

WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE SENIOR LOAN MARKET?

We expect that technical imbalances, rather than credit fundamentals, will be
the more immediate challenge to the Senior Loan market. The pipeline of new
Senior Loans that was committed to by commercial and investment banks (but has
yet to be distributed) exceeds $150 billion, a large number by any measure. Many
of these financing commitments were made in the first half of 2007, with the
expectation that the debt would be sold into a receptive market as the
transactions neared completion. The rapid change in the credit markets has
resulted in the banks having to hold loans with terms that are no longer
appealing to loan investors. The number and size of these commitments, combined
with their terms no longer being "market," will continue to weigh on the market
until these loans are distributed or otherwise removed from the supply overhang.

Likewise, there is no imminent solution to the demand reduction which resulted
from reduced CLO issuance. While non-traditional investors will likely continue
to see value in the Senior Loan market, the sheer magnitude of the new issue
pipeline, combined with the sharp reduction in demand, will continue to create a
supply-demand imbalance for the foreseeable future. We expect this imbalance to
result in increased and persistent price volatility in excess of historical
levels.

The average spread to maturity implied by current market prices approximates
L+400, which is historically high particularly in an environment of record low
default rates. While we do expect default rates to increase, we think that
current spread levels are very compelling for senior secured risk. It is also
worth reminding investors that Senior Loans generally hold one of the most
senior positions in the capital structure of a business entity (the "Borrower"),
are typically secured with specific collateral and have a claim on the assets
and/or stock of the Borrower. They are senior to the claims held by subordinated
debt holders and stockholders of the Borrower.


                                                                          Page 3

                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION OF THE FUND CURRENTLY?

The investment strategy employed is designed to achieve the Fund's objectives
through entire economic and credit cycles. Many managers of Senior Loan-based
closed-end funds invest up to 20% or more of their portfolios in high-yield
bonds in order to boost yields in the short run. FCT, on the other hand, is a
"pure play" strategy that generally does not invest in high-yield bonds, and
focuses primarily on Senior Loans. In some market environments, the Fund's pure
play strategy will result in lower current dividends/yields than some other
Senior Loan-based closed-end funds with meaningful allocations to high-yield
bonds. However, we believe that our investment strategy can result in lower NAV
volatility and higher NAV returns while maintaining competitive
dividends/yields.

The Fund's investment strategy focuses on thorough fundamental credit analysis,
broad issuer and industry diversification, and a proactive sell discipline in
order to minimize risk. The Fund's portfolio is generally more heavily weighted
towards industry groups that we expect to exhibit lower earnings volatility, and
which we expect to provide high recoveries to senior lenders in circumstances
where earnings volatility does occur. The Fund is broadly diversified with over
200 positions across 30 industries. At November 30, 2007, the five largest
individual borrower exposures in total represented 10.9% of the Fund's
portfolio.

As mentioned in prior reports, the Fund is leveraged using both Auction Market
Preferred Shares and a revolving borrowing facility provided by an asset-backed
commercial paper conduit. The terms and conditions of the leverage provide the
Fund with the ability to borrow on a floating-rate basis. Since the income
generated by the Fund's Senior Loan investment portfolio is also floating rate,
the Fund is less exposed to interest rate risk than a closed-end fund with a
fixed-rate investment portfolio, and investors will generally benefit from
portfolio leverage (in a positive return environment) regardless of short-term
interest rates. At November 30, 2007, the portfolio leverage accounted for 38.6%
of the Fund's total managed assets.

</TABLE>

- ----------------------------
      (a)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on
            net assets applicable to Common Shares.

      (b)   Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- by
            Standard & Poor's Ratings Group are considered to be below
            investment grade.

      (c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
            prepayment. Prepayments of Senior Loans may occur because of the
            mandatory prepayment conditions or because there may be significant
            economic incentives for a borrower to optionally prepay. As a
            result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may be
            substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Senior Loans
            generally have maturities that range from five to eight years;
            however, the Fund estimates that refinancing and prepayments result
            in an average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio to
            be approximately 18-30 months.

      (d)   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at
            rates which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base
            lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally
            (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European banks,
            such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime
            rate offered by one or more major United States banks or (iii) the
            certificate of deposit rate.

      (e)   This Senior Loan Interest was privately rated upon issuance. The
            rating agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the rating.

      (f)   This issue is secured by a second lien on the issuer's assets.

      (g)   Delayed Draw Loan (See Note 2E)

      (h)   This issue is unsecured.

      (i)   Represents commitment fee rate on delayed draw loans.

      (j)   Securities are restricted and cannot be offered for public sale
            without first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
            amended (See Note 2F).

      (k)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax and financial reporting
            purposes.

      (l)   This security is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note
            whereby 1.00% of interest per annum will be paid in cash and 13.75%
            of interest per annum shall be paid by the issuer, at its option (i)
            entirely in cash, (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii)
            a combination thereof. Interest is paid semi-annually and the first
            interest payment date is January 15, 2008.

      (m)   This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Fund's Common Shares is determined daily as
of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on
each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is calculated by
subtracting the Fund's liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends
payable and any borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any
outstanding Preferred Shares from the Fund's Total Assets (the value of
securities and other investments the Fund holds plus cash or other assets,
including interest accrued but not yet received), and dividing the result by the
total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value
method to value the Fund's securities and investments. Additionally, if events
occur after the close of the principal market for particular securities (e.g.,
domestic debt and foreign securities), but before the Fund values its assets,
that could materially affect NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method to
value the Fund's securities and investments. The use of fair value pricing by
the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business

                          NOVEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

day as of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in less than 60 days are valued at amortized cost.

B. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS:

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes or to
gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. The Fund may be either the buyer or seller in a credit
default swap transaction. The "buyer" in a credit default swap contract is
obligated to pay the "seller" a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default on the underlying reference
obligation has occurred. If an event of default occurs, the seller must pay the
buyer the full notional value, or "par value", of the reference obligation. In
exchange, the seller receives the par value of securities of the reference
obligor. An event of default may be a grace period extension, obligation
acceleration, repudiation/moratorium, or restructuring.

If the Fund is a buyer and no event of default occurs, the Fund will have made a
series of periodic payments and recover nothing of monetary value. However, if
an event of default occurs, the Fund (if the "buyer") will receive the full
notional value, or "par value" of the reference obligation. Buying a credit
default swap contract involves the risk that the contract may expire worthless
and the credit risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment obligations
to the Fund in the event of default. If the Fund is a seller and no event of
default occurs, the Fund will have received a periodic stream of payments over
the term of the contract and paid nothing of monetary value. However, if an
event of default occurs, the Fund (if the "seller") must pay the buyer the full
notional value, or "par value," of the reference obligation. In exchange, the
Fund receives the par value of securities of the reference obligor. Selling a
credit default swap contract involves greater risks than if the Fund had
invested in the reference obligation directly. The Fund will segregate assets in
the form of cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the aggregate
market value of the credit default swap contracts of which it is a seller.
Additionally, the Fund maintains liquid assets for the full notional amount of
the credit default swap contracts of which it is a seller. The Fund may only
enter into such transactions with counterparties rated A- or higher.

Credit default swap contracts are marked to market daily based upon quotations
from brokers or market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation (depreciation). For a credit default swap contract sold
by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount made by the Fund in the event of
default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of the
reference debt obligation purchased/received.

C. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

D. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.


                                                                         Page 23

                          NOVEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid assets with a
current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments. At November 30, 2007, the Fund had no
when-issued or delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

E. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
approximately $12,249,870 as of November 30, 2007. The Fund is obligated to fund
these loan commitments at the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation
of $531,311 from these commitments is included in "Accrued expenses and other
liabilities" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

F. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that can not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Prior to registration, restricted securities may only be
resold in transactions exempt from registration. The Fund held restricted
securities at November 30, 2007 as shown in the following table. The Fund does
not have the right to demand that such securities be registered. These
securities are valued using market quotations according to the valuation
procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not
expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted
security. There are no unrestricted securities with the same maturity dates and
yields for these issuers.

G. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2007 is as follows:

                                                         2007
                                                     ------------
Distributions paid from:
Ordinary Income .................................    $ 43,016,710

As of May 31, 2007, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income ...................    $  2,802,736
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) ......    $ (1,102,866)

                          NOVEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

H. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

In June 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No.
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
Statement 109 ("FIN 48"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006. This Interpretation prescribes a minimum threshold for
financial statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. As of November 30, 2007, management has
evaluated the application of FIN 48 to the Fund, and has determined that there
is no material impact resulting from the adoption of this Interpretation on the
Fund's financial statements.

Certain capital losses realized after October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2007, the Fund has elected to defer capital losses occurring
between November 1, 2006 and May 31, 2007 in the amount of $69,023.

As of May 31, 2007, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward for federal income
tax purpose of $3,984,460, expiring on May 31, 2014.

I. EXPENSES:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

J. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT:

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157") was issued by the FASB and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications
of SFAS 157 and its impact on the Fund's financial statements if any, has not
been determined.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage, L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares, and the
principal amount of borrowings) minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid
dividends on any outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor")
serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Trustees approved a revised compensation plan.
Under the revised plan, each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First
Trust, any sub-advisor or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is
paid an annual retainer of $10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the
First Trust Fund Complex and an annual retainer of $7,500 per trust of each
subsequent trust added to the First Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer is
allocated equally among each of the trusts. No additional meeting fees are paid
in connection with board or committee meetings.


                                                                         Page 25

</TABLE>

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of November 30, 2007, the Fund
has 2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B AMP Shares outstanding at a liquidation
value of $25,000 per share.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of November 30, 2007 was 5.30% and 5.25%
for the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. The high and low annual dividend rates during the six
months ended November 30, 2007, for the Series A 7 day auction were 6.25% and
5.02%, respectively, and the average dividend rate was 5.40%. The high and low
annual dividend rates during the six months ended November 30, 2007, for the
Series B 28 day auction were 6.50% and 5.25%, respectively, and the average
dividend rate was 5.58%. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly
to the income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
Common Shareholders.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund has entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit
Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be
used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of
July 28, 2008. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the
Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total
assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$195,000,000. For the six months ended November 30, 2007, the average amount
outstanding was $174,808,743. The high and low annual interest rates during the
six months ended November 30, 2007, were 5.75% and 5.13%, respectively, with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.38%. The annual interest rate in effect at
November 30, 2007 was 5.19%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs,
which include an administration fee of 0.02%, a program fee of 0.18% and a
liquidity fee of 0.10% per year. Such expenses are included in "Interest and
fees on loan" on the Statement of Operations.

                             8. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur.

LOWER GRADE DEBT INSTRUMENTS: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally lower grade. These lower grade debt instruments may become the subject
of bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise subsequently default as to the repayment
of principal and/or payment of interest or be downgraded to ratings in the lower
rating categories. Lower grade debt instruments tend to be less liquid than
higher grade debt instruments.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. The Fund borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing
program, through the issuance of Preferred Shares, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares, with
respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation. The Fund may not be
permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or Preferred Shares or purchase
Common Shares or Preferred Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a Borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
Lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that Lender. The value of the collateral may not
equal the Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline
below the principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's
investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the
Borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the
stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or
substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under
collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior
Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of
non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be
readily liquidated.


                                                                         Page 27

                               9. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PFPC
Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Plan. If you
elect to receive cash distributions, you will receive all distributions in cash
paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc., as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases.

Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the Plan Agent may
exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of
fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions
received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of
the valuation date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases
is necessary to comply with federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid
on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.
