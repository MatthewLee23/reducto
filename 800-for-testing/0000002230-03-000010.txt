applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities, including options, at June 30, 2003 was $1,082,590,946 and net
unrealized appreciation aggregated $163,376,110, of which the related gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $336,955,027 and $173,578,917,
respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $74,002,120 and

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



On June 30, 2003, the Company held a total of 2,324,112 shares of its Common
Stock at a cost of $25,266,897. The Company held 697,012 shares of its Common
Stock at a cost of $7,554,426 on December 31, 2002.

The Company has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 2,610,146 shares of the Company's Common Stock
at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are exercisable
beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend and vest
over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and
extend over the period during which the option is exercisable. The stock
appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise
their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the Common Stock at the
date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by
the Company during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2003, 259,023 options
were outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $11.1902 per share.
During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company granted options
including stock appreciation rights for 57,398 shares of Common Stock with a
weighted average exercise price of $10.975. During the six months ended June
30, 2003, stock appreciation rights relating to 33,838 stock option shares were
exercised at a weighted average market price of $11.6328 per share and the
stock options relating to these rights with a weighted average exercise price
of $3.1327 per share were cancelled. Stock options and stock appreciation
rights relating to 43,619 shares, and with a weighted average exercise price of
$11.1632, were cancelled. At June 30, 2003, there were outstanding exercisable
options to purchase 86,711 common shares at $2.6042-$19.0100 per share
(weighted average price of $13.6111), and unexercisable options to purchase
152,253 common shares at $4.3883-$19.0100 per share (weighted average price of
$11.4735). The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding
exercisable and unexercisable options is 6.6987 years and 6.9680 years,
respectively. Total compensation expense recognized for the six months ended
June 30, 2003 related to the stock options and stock appreciation rights plan
was $(64,348). At June 30, 2003, there were 1,242,752 shares available for
future option grants.

5. Retirement Plans

The Company provides retirement benefits for its employees under a
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based
on years of service and compensation during the last 5 years of employment. The
Company's current funding policy is to contribute annually to the plan only
those amounts that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. As of June
30, 2003, the plan assets, consisting of investments in individual stocks,
bonds and mutual funds were $9,538,724. In determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation, the interest rate used for the
weighted average discount rate was 6.75%, the expected rate of annual salary
increases was 7.0%, and the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets
was 8.0%. The projected benefit obligation as of June 30, 2003 was $6,145,677.
Prepaid pension cost included in other assets at June 30, 2003 was $5,847,452.

In addition, the Company has a nonqualified benefit plan which provides
employees with defined retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan.
The Company does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. Expenses

former employees of the Company was $2,326,390. Aggregate remuneration paid or
accrued during the six months ended June 30, 2003 to key employees and
directors amounted to $787,784.

7. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of the securities loaned that
may occur during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Company.
At June 30, 2003, the Company had securities on loan of $160,654,047 and held
collateral of $166,977,546, consisting of repurchase agreements and a

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at June 30, 2003, and the results of
its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for
each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at June 30, 2003, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
