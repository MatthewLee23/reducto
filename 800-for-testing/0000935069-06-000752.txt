To the Members and Board of Directors of
  UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of portfolio
investments,  as of December 31, 2005,  and the related  statement of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes in members'
capital  for each of the two  years  in the  period  then  ended  and  financial
highlights for each of the years indicated therein.  These financial  statements
and financial  highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audit included  consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
securities  owned as of December 31, 2005 by  correspondence  with management of
the investment funds or by other appropriate  auditing  procedures where replies
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UBS M2
Fund, L.L.C. at December 31, 2005, the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended and the changes in its members' capital for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the indicated years, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.   ORGANIZATION

         UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability
         company under the laws of Delaware on September 4, 2002. The Fund is
         registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
         "1940 Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
         company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek capital
         appreciation over the long term. The Fund is a multi-manager fund that
         seeks to achieve its objective by deploying its assets among a select
         group of portfolio managers who primarily employ long/short equity
         strategies, including those involving foreign issuers. Generally, such
         portfolio managers conduct their investment programs through
         unregistered investment funds (collectively, the "Investment Funds"),
         in which the Fund invests as a limited partner, member or shareholder
         along with other investors. The Fund commenced operations on February
         1, 2003.

         The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall
         responsibility to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
         including the exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies
         regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
         The Directors have engaged UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. ("UBSFA", the
         "Adviser" and, when providing services under the Administration
         Agreement, the "Administrator"), a Delaware limited liability company,
         to provide investment advice regarding the selection of Investment
         Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

         The Adviser is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,
         Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered
         as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
         amended.

         Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors
         may be accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine and are
         generally accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any
         application for interests in the Fund.

         The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant
         to written tenders to Members. These repurchases will be made at such
         times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their
         complete and exclusive discretion. Members can only transfer or assign
         their membership interests (i) by operation of law pursuant to the
         death, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii) with
         the written approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their
         sole and absolute discretion.

    2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
         Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period in
         accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
         determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the
         Directors. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to
         the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and

                                                                               6
<PAGE>

                                                             UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         offering memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in
         Investment Funds are carried at fair value as determined by the Fund's
         pro rata interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund. All
         valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
         Fund and are net of management and performance incentive fees or
         allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers or pursuant to
         the Investment Funds' agreements. The Fund's valuation procedures
         require the Adviser to consider all relevant information available at
         the time the Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board
         will consider such information and consider whether it is appropriate,
         in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its
         net asset value as reported or whether to adjust such value. The
         underlying investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at
         fair value as described in each Investment Fund's financial statements
         (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

         Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in
         the form of cash or securities, are first applied as a reduction of the
         investment's cost.

         B.  INCOME RECOGNITION

         Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and
         losses from Investment Fund transactions are calculated on the
         identified cost basis.

         C.  FUND COSTS

         The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but
         not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to
         portfolio transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal
         fees; accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing
         the Fund's net asset value; costs of insurance; registration expenses;
         certain organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related
         expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with
         respect to communications to Members; and other types of expenses
         approved by the Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as
         incurred.

         D.  INCOME TAXES

         No provision for the payment of Federal, state or local income taxes
         has been provided, since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each
         Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its
         distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

         The Fund has reclassified $8,958,727 and $13,152,746 from accumulated
         net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from investments
         and foreign currency transactions to net capital contributions during
         the year ended December 31, 2005. The reclassification was to reflect,
         as an adjustment to net capital contributions, the amount of taxable
         income or loss that have been allocated to the Fund's Members and had
         no effect on net assets.

                                                                               7

                                                             UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         E.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
         account that pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost plus
         accrued interest, which is included in interest receivable on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         F.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

         From time to time the Fund may enter into repurchase agreements. In
         connection with such transactions it is the Fund's policy that its
         custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the
         fair value of which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase
         transaction, including accrued interest, at all times. If the seller
         defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines, realization of
         the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. As of December
         31, 2005 there were no open repurchase agreements.

         G.   USE OF ESTIMATES

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
         generally accepted accounting principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
         financial statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Fund's financial statements are
         reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these
         estimates.

    3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant
         to an Investment Manager Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the
         Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the "Investment Management Fee")
         at the annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets, excluding assets
         attributable to the Adviser and the Administrator. The Administrator
         provides certain administrative services to the Fund, including, among
         other things, providing office space and other support services. In
         consideration for such services, the Fund pays the Administrator a
         monthly fee (the "Administrator Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the
         Fund's net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Administrator's
         and the Adviser's capital account. The Administrator Fee and the
         Investment Management Fee will be paid to the Administrator out of the
         Fund's assets and debited against the Members' capital accounts,
         excluding net assets attributable to the Administrator's and the
         Adviser's capital account. A portion of the Investment Management Fee
         and the Administrator Fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

         UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
         UBS Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without
         special compensation from the Fund, and will bear its own costs
         associated with its activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if
         any, charged on contributions are debited against the contribution
         amounts to arrive at a net subscription amount. The placement fee does
         not constitute assets of the Fund.

                                                                               8

    3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

         The net increase (or decrease) in Members' capital derived from
         operations (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of
         all Members on a pro-rata basis, other than the Investment Management
         Fee and the Administrator Fee which are similarly allocated to all
         Members other than the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

         In order to achieve a more equitable distribution of the impact of
         certain initial organization and offering costs, the Fund has either
         credited to or debited against the Members' capital accounts the sum of
         such initial costs based on each individual Member's percentage of
         capital in the Fund. The reallocation of these costs will occur for the
         first twelve months after the initial closing date of the Fund.

         Each Director of the Fund receives an annual retainer of $5,000 plus a
         fee for each meeting attended. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund
         for all reasonable out of pocket expenses. Total amounts expensed by
         the Fund related to Directors for the year ended December 31, 2005 were
         $24,917, which is included in miscellaneous expense.

    4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

         PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as the
         custodian (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides custodial
         services for the Fund.

         PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as Accounting and
         Investor Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides
         certain administrative, accounting, record keeping, tax and Member
         related services. PFPC Inc. receives a monthly fee primarily based upon
         (i) the average net assets of the Fund subject to a minimum monthly
         fee, and (ii) the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain other
         investment funds sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or its
         affiliates. Additionally, the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket
         expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

    5.   CREDIT FACILITY

         Effective July 1, 2005 the Fund, along with other UBS sponsored funds,
         entered into a $150,000,000 committed, unsecured revolving line of
         credit with Harris Trust and Savings Bank. Under the most restrictive
         arrangement, the Fund may borrow an amount that combined with the other
         borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets. The
         Fund's borrowing capacity is also limited to the portion of the unused
         line of credit at any point in time. The Fund is only liable under the
         line of credit to the extent of its own borrowing there under. The
         interest rate on the borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus
         150 basis points per annum. The expiration date of such credit
         agreements is June 30, 2006. The committed facility also requires a fee
         to be paid by the Fund, on a pro rata basis, based on the amount of the
         aggregate commitment which has not been utilized of 25 basis points per
         annum. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the Fund's
         average interest rate paid on borrowings was 4.16% per annum and the
         average borrowings outstanding were $2,934,452. The Fund had $3,000,000
         in borrowings outstanding at year ended December 31, 2005. Interest
         expense for the year was $122,425, of which $1,277 was payable at year
         end.

                                                                               9

    6.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate purchases and sales of Investment Funds for the year ended
         December 31, 2005 amounted to $163,000,000 and $195,397,622
         respectively.

         The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
         items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment
         Funds. The allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by the
         Investment Funds on Schedules K-1. The Fund has not yet received all
         such Schedules K-1 for the year ended December 31, 2005.

    7.   INVESTMENTS

         As of December 31, 2005, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds,
         none of which were related parties. The Fund's investments are
         summarized below based on the investment objectives of the specific
         Investment Funds at December 31, 2005.

         Investment Objective                       Cost           Fair Value
         --------------------                       ----           ----------

            Long/Short Equity                  $388,000,000      $495,595,063

         The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for
         compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
         fees of between 2% and 2.5% (per annum) of net assets and performance
         incentive fees or allocations ranging from 16.5% to 25% of net profits
         earned. The Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with
         lock up provisions of up to two years from initial investment. Detailed
         information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.
         Some of the underlying Funds have side pockets. Therefore, the Fund
         cannot fully redeem unless there is a realizable event.

    8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the
         Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
         investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but
         are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
         contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
         these Investment Funds is limited to the value of these investments as
         reported by the Fund.

    9.   INDEMNIFICATION

         In the ordinary course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts
         or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future
         events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions
         against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels
         that the likelihood of such an event is remote.

                                                                              10

                  any,  incurred  when  subscribing  to the Fund.  Total returns for a period of less than a full year are not

                  transactions.

                         ADVISORY CONTRACT RENEWAL RIDER

         The Directors (including the Independent Directors) last evaluated the
Investment Management Agreement at a meeting on November 15, 2005. The Directors
met in an executive session during which they were advised by and had the
opportunity to discuss with independent legal counsel the approval of the
Investment Management Agreement. The Directors reviewed materials furnished by
the Adviser, including information regarding the Adviser, its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. The Directors also reviewed,
among other things, the nature of the services to be provided by the Adviser,
including its investment process, and the experience of the investment advisory
and other personnel proposing to provide services to the Fund. The Directors
felt that the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was
appropriate and that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage
the Fund. The Directors also reviewed the performance of the Fund and compared
that performance to the performance of other investment companies presented by
the Adviser which have objectives and strategies similar to those of the Fund
and which are managed by third-party investment advisers ("Comparable Funds").
The Directors determined that the performance of the Fund was consistent with
that of the Comparable Funds by noting that the Fund's performance was higher
than one-half of the Comparable Funds. The Directors also compared the
volatility of the Fund to that of the Comparable Funds presented. They noted
that the Fund's volatility was higher than the median volatility of the
Comparable Funds. The Directors also considered the fees being charged by the
Adviser for its services as compared to those charged to the Comparable Funds,
and as compared to the fees charged by the Adviser and its affiliates for other
UBS alternative products. The information presented to the Directors showed that
the management fee being
<PAGE>

charged to the Fund was above the median  management  fee being charged to those
of the Comparable Funds, although less than or equal to the management fee being
charged  to those of the  Comparable  Funds  which  were  registered  under  the
Investment  Company Act of 1940.  The Directors also noted that the Fund was not
subject to any  incentive  fee. In comparing  the advisory fees being charged to
the Fund to the fees being charged by the Adviser and its  affiliates  for other
UBS  alternative  investment  products,  the  Directors  noted that although the
combination  of management fee and service fee being charged to the Fund was the
highest being charged to an Alternative Investment Group fund-of-funds, the Fund
was not subject to any incentive fee. In light of the  foregoing,  the Directors
felt that the  management  fee being  charged to the Fund was  appropriate.  The
Directors also considered the  profitability  of the Adviser both before payment
to brokers  and after  payment to brokers and  concluded  that the profits to be
realized by the  Adviser  and its  affiliates  under the  Investment  Management
Agreement  and from other  relationships  between the Fund and the Adviser  were
within  a  range  the  Directors  considered  reasonable  and  appropriate.  The
Directors  also  discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large  enough at that
time to  support  a request  for  breakpoints  due to  economies  of scale.  The
Directors  determined  that the fees under the Investment  Management  Agreement
were  reasonable.  The  Directors  concluded  that  approval  of the  Investment
Management Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its investors.

          services rendered to the registrant,  and rendered to the registrant's

      (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of the  board  of  directors  has
          considered  whether the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
          rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including any
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
          entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common control with the
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.

                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES



A. INTRODUCTION
     UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. (the "Adviser") votes proxies for each fund (each
a "Fund," collectively, the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as
such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and Procedures"). The Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting securities of Investment Funds.

The Investment Funds typically do not submit matters to investors for vote;
however, should a matter be submitted for vote and provided the Fund holds
voting interests in the Investment Fund, the Adviser will vote proxies in what
it views to be in the best interest of the Fund and in accordance with these
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:


<PAGE>

  >> A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment Fund
     soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on an
     impending proxy vote;

  >> The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
     personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
     outcome of a shareholder vote;


  >> Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio manager
     responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior management, have a
     personal interest through investment in the Investment Fund soliciting
     proxies;


  >> Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
     outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either the
     Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

     Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such
conflicts of interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the
Chief Compliance Officer, Legal or the Risk Control Manager (or designees
thereof) who will work with appropriate personnel of the Adviser to determine
the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

     If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the
Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material
conflict of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

  >> Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which consent
     in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's board of
     directors);

  >> Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on its
     behalf;


  >> Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy based
     on application of the policies set forth herein; or

  >> Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances given
     the nature of the conflict.


<PAGE>


E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

    The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

    Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

    The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting in
an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the end
of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

  >> A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

  >> A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

  >> A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and related
     materials with regard to each vote;

  >> A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
     conflicts of interest;

  >> A copy  of  any  document  created by  the Adviser that  was  material to a
     proxy-voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that decision; and

  >> A copy of each written investor request for information on how the Adviser
     voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any written response
     from the Adviser to any (written or oral) investor request for information
     on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                               UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.
                          Portfolio Manager Disclosure

     The registrant (also referred to as the "Fund") is managed by a portfolio
management team, each member of which (each, a "Portfolio Manager" and together,
the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for the day-to-day management of the
Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the lead member of the portfolio
management team, is primarily responsible for the selection of the Fund's
investments, and is jointly responsible for the allocation of the Fund's assets
among Investment Funds. Kevin Hite and Mark Hansen, the other members of the
portfolio management team, are jointly and primarily responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's investments.

     Mr. Sienko has been associated with UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C., the Fund's
Adviser since prior to 2000, and he is also a Senior Vice President of UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial Services"). Mr. Hite has been associated
with the Adviser since 1999, and he is also a Vice President of UBS Financial
Services. Mr. Hansen has been associated with the Adviser since 2001, and he is
also an Assistant Vice President of UBS Financial Services.

     The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

     Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio
Managers' management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of
interest may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation
of limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

     Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that
differ from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio
Managers may purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts,
and the performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the
performance of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio
Managers may place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or
indirectly contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have
the potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

     A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

<PAGE>

     The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of
its clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly.
The Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including
brokerage and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address
the conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients.
In addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel at UBS
Financial Services periodically review the performance of the Portfolio
Managers.

     The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed
salary and a discretionary bonus paid by UBS Financial Services or its
affiliates and not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid
in shares of stock or stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of
the Adviser, subject to certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio
Manager's discretionary bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock
options of UBS AG, is determined by senior officers of UBS Financial Services.
In general, the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors,
none of which is necessarily weighted more than any other factor. These factors
may include: the overall performance of UBS Financial Services and its
Alternative Investment Group; the overall performance of UBS AG; the
profitability to UBS Financial Services derived from the management of the Fund
and the other accounts managed by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute
performance of the Fund and such other accounts for the preceding year;
contributions by the Portfolio Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative
Investment Group; participation by the Portfolio Manager in training of
personnel; and support by the Portfolio Manager generally to colleagues. The
bonus is not based on a precise formula, benchmark or other metric.

     The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by
the Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
