PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


DEAR SHAREHOLDER:
The US bond market continued to reward investors with solid returns for the
period covered by this report. As key economic indicators sent mixed signals,
the US economy continued to struggle and interest rates declined. In November,
the Federal Reserve Board lowered a key short-term interest rate--the federal
funds rate--to 1.25%, a new low.1 The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell
to a 45-year low of 3.3% near the end of the period. Although the environment
was favorable to bonds, declining interest rates and relatively low inflation
raised the fear that deflation, which hasn't been seen since the 1930s, would
return.

Bonds reported gains across all sectors. Leadership rotated from higher quality
bonds, which were the top performers in the previous period, to lower quality
bonds. Corporate and high-yield bonds rebounded as investors became more willing
to take on risk. However, in the municipal market high-grade bonds outperformed
high yield.

The following report will provide you with more detailed information about the
trust's performance and the investment strategies used by portfolio manager
Maureen Newman. For more information, please contact your financial advisor.

CONSOLIDATION AND A NEW NAME: COLUMBIA
On April 1, 2003, six of the asset management firms brought together when
Columbia Management Group, Inc. was formed were consolidated and renamed
Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (Columbia Management). This consolidation
does not affect the management or investment objectives of your trust and is the
next step in our efforts to create a consistent identity and to streamline our
organization. Although the name of the asset manager familiar to you has
changed, what hasn't changed is the commitment of our specialized investment
teams to a multi-disciplined approach to investing, focused on our goal of
offering shareholders the best products and services.

As always, we thank you for choosing Colonial High Income Municipal Trust and
for giving us the opportunity to help you build a strong financial future.

/s/ Joseph R. Palombo

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT


For the six-month period ended May 31, 2003, Colonial High Income Municipal
Trust returned 2.04%, based on net asset value. The trust trailed its peer
group. The average return for the Lipper High Yield Municipal Debt Funds
Category was 4.63%.1

The trust's performance relative to its peer group suffered because nursing home
bonds were hurt by cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursements. The nursing home sector
represents a sizeable portion of the trust. A small stake in tobacco bonds,
which are backed by settlement money from tobacco companies, also hurt
performance. The bonds lost value as investors reacted to an unfavorable court
judgement, which raised fears that the industry might default on payments. While
we believe that we will continue to see volatility in that sector, we do not
share the concern about default and continue to hold the bonds. The trust's
United Airlines bond (0.2% of net assets)2 tumbled as well after the company
declared bankruptcy and stopped payments to bondholders. Also deterring
performance to some extent were short positions in U.S. Treasury futures
contracts, which are employed to reduce the overall duration of the trust. We
believe that the trust's duration was shorter, on average, than that of our
competitors during a period of rising bond prices. Duration is a measure of
interest rate sensitivity. Shorter duration bonds underperform during bond
market rallies.

The trust benefited, however, from US Airways bonds (0.2% of net assets), which
rallied after the company emerged from bankruptcy. It also benefited from its
investment in zero coupon municipal bonds, which did well as interest rates
declined. Approximately 31% of the trust's assets was invested in non-rated
bonds, which helped generate income. We attempted to reduce the impact of any
individual default by diversifying across many different sectors. Additional
income came from the trust's leverage through its preferred shares. The trust
benefited because the short-term variable rate it paid out on these shares was
much lower than the yield it earned through investing in longer maturity bonds.

Our focus was on essential services bonds, which are backed by revenues from
user fees. We added utilities and retirement housing bonds, but trimmed slightly
in the health-care area. We also shifted toward intermediate maturity (15-20
year) bonds. These bonds offer most of the yield of longer maturity issues with
less risk. Going forward, we expect a slow economic recovery, stable interest
rates and tame inflation to benefit high-yield municipal bonds.

1  Lipper Inc., a widely respected data provider in the industry, calculates
   an average total return for mutual funds with similar investment objectives
   as those of the fund.

Past performance is no guarantee of future investment results. The principal
value and investment returns will fluctuate, resulting in a gain or loss on
sale.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-free income, but it also involves
certain risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Investing in high
yield securities offers the potential for high current income and attractive
total return, but involves certain risks. Lower-rated bond risks include default
of the issuer and rising interest rates. Interest income from certain tax-exempt
bonds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and
corporations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION:
Colonial High Income Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts business
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Trust's
investment goal is to provide high current income, generally exempt from federal
income taxes. The Trust's secondary investment goal is to seek total return. The
Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial
interest and 4,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION AND TRANSACTIONS:
Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service based upon market
transactions for normal, institutional-size trading units of similar securities.
Such services may use various pricing techniques which take into account
appropriate factors such as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of
issue, trading characteristics and other data, as well as broker quotes. Certain
securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of lesser quality, are
priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial condition of the issuer
and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations developed through pricing
techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized upon sale of the
securities, and the potential variation may be greater for those securities
valued using fundamental analysis. When management deems it appropriate, an
over-the-counter or exchange bid quotation is used.

Options are valued at the last reported sale price, or in the absence of a sale,
the mean between the last quoted bid and asking price.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Short-term obligations with a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or quotations
which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair value under
procedures approved by the Board of Trustees.

Security transactions are accounted for on the date the securities are
purchased, sold or mature.

Cost is determined and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification
method for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms. This may
increase the risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and
causes the Trust to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:
Consistent with the Trust's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable and tax-exempt income, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

INTEREST INCOME, DEBT DISCOUNT AND PREMIUM:
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are being
amortized and accreted, respectively for all debt securities.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date.

Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at
the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is
generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on May 31, 2003
was 0.93% for Series T and 1.10% for Series W. For the six months ended May 31,
2003, the Trust declared dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting
to $656,156, representing an average APS dividend rate of 1.10%.

NOTE 2. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

                                        ===========

NOTE 3. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

MANAGEMENT FEE:
On April 1, 2003, Colonial Management Associates, Inc. ("Colonial"), the
investment advisor to the Trust merged into Columbia Management Advisors, Inc.
("Columbia"), formerly known as Columbia Management Co., an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation. At the time of the
merger, Columbia assumed the obligations of Colonial with respect to the Trust.
The merger did not change the way the Trust is managed, the investment personnel
assigned to manage the Trust or the fees paid by the Trust to Columbia.

Columbia is the investment advisor of the Trust and furnishes accounting and
other services and office facilities for a fee to be paid monthly at the annual
rate of 0.75% of the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets
applicable to the APS.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES:
Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a Pricing and Bookkeeping Agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"). Columbia pays fees to State Street
under the Outsourcing Agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000, paid monthly, and in any month
that the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to the
APS, are more than $50 million, a monthly fee equal to the average weekly net
assets, including assets applicable to the APS, of the Trust for that month
multiplied by a fee rate that is calculated by taking into account the fees
payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. For the six months
ended May 31, 2003, the annualized net asset based fee rate was 0.033%. The
Trust also pays out-of-pocket costs for pricing services.

OTHER:
The Trust pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates.

The Trust's Independent Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan
which may be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely
out of the Trust's assets.

The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which $476 of custody
fees were reduced by balance credits for the six months ended May 31, 2003. The
Trust could have invested a portion of the assets utilized in connection with
the expense offset arrangement in an income-producing asset if it had not
entered into such an agreement.

NOTE 4. PREFERRED SHARES
The Trust currently has outstanding 4,800 APS (2,400 shares each of Series T and
W). The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust on any dividend payment
date at the redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any
dividends accumulated on a daily basis unpaid through the redemption date
(whether or not such dividends have been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and in
accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies. Should
these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS not be
paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain of the APS. At May 31, 2003,
there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

INVESTMENT ACTIVITY:
During the six months ended May 31, 2003, purchases and sales of investments,
other than short-term obligations, were $16,867,255 and $29,794,093,
respectively.

Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) at May 31, 2003, based on cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes, was:

Gross unrealized appreciation                  $ 25,228,217
Gross unrealized depreciation                   (22,002,734)
                                               ------------
   Net unrealized appreciation                 $  3,225,483
                                               ============

FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS:
The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to different trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia of the future direction of interest rates.
Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding the variation margin recorded
in the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with its custodian in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin
requirement. Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the
daily change in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin payable
or receivable and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust recognizes a
realized gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.

The Trust may write call and put options on futures it owns or in which it may
invest. Writing put options tends to increase the Trust's exposure to the
underlying instrument. Writing call options tends to decrease the Trust's
exposure to the underlying instrument. When the Trust writes a call or put
option, an amount equal to the premium received is recorded as a liability and
subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
written. Premiums received from writing options which expire are treated as
realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or
closed are added to the proceeds or offset against the amounts paid on the
underlying future transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. The Trust
as a writer of an option has no control over whether the underlying future may
be sold (call) or purchased (put) and as a result bears the market risk of an
unfavorable change in the price of the future underlying the written option.
There is the risk the Trust may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid market.

The Trust may also purchase put and call options. Purchasing call options tends
to increase the Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. Purchasing put
options tends to decrease the Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. The
Fund pays a premium which is included in the Trust's Statement of Assets and
Liabilities as an investment and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the
current value of the option. Premiums paid for purchasing options which expire
are treated as realized losses. The risk associated with purchasing put and call
options is limited to the premium paid. Premiums paid for purchasing options
which are exercised or closed are added to the amounts paid or offset against
the proceeds on the underlying future transaction to determine the realized gain
or loss.

contracts at May 31, 2003.

OTHER:

There are certain risks arising from geographic concentration in any state.
Certain revenue or tax related events in a state may impair the ability of
certain issuers of municipal securities to pay principal and interest on their
obligations also, investing in non-rated securities offer the potential for high
current income and attractive total return, but involves certain risks.

The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

Restricted securities are securities that may only be resold upon registration
under federal securities laws or in transactions exempt from such registration.
In some cases, the issuer of restricted securities has agreed to register such
securities for resale, at the issuer's expense either upon demand by the Trust
or in connection with another registered offering of the securities. Many
restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions
exempt from registration. Such restricted securities may be determined to be
liquid under criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The Trust will not
incur any registration costs upon such resale. The Trust's restricted securities
are valued at the price provided by dealers in the secondary market or, if no
market prices are available, at the fair value as determined in good faith using
methods approved by the Board of Trustees.

(a)The Trust changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to November 30.
(b)Per share data was calculated using average shares outstanding during the
   period.
(c)Effective December 1, 2001, the Trust adopted the provisions of the AICPA
   Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting
   market discount on all debt securities. The effect of this change, for the
   year ended November 30, 2002, was to increase the ratio of net investment
   income to average net assets from 8.31% to 8.36% and increase the ratio of
   net investment income (adjusted for dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders) from 7.48% to 7.53%. The impact to net investment income and
   net realized and unrealized loss per share was less than $0.01. Per share
   data and ratios for periods prior to November 30, 2002, have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.
(d)The per share net investment income amount does not reflect the period's
   reclassification of differences between book and tax basis net investment
   income.
(e)Total return at market value assuming all distributions reinvested at prices
   calculated in accordance with the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
(f)Not annualized.
(g)The benefits derived from custody credits and directed brokerage
   arrangements, if applicable, had an impact of less than 0.01%.
(h)Ratios reflect average net assets available to common shares only.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN


COLONIAL HIGH INCOME MUNICIPAL TRUST

Shareholders may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
automatically reinvested by EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Agent"), as
agent under the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the
Plan, the provisions of which are described below, shareholders not making such
an election will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check mailed directly
to the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If the Trustees of the Trust declare a dividend or determine to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares of the Trust or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash
and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of the Trust.
If the market price of the shares on the payment date for the dividend or
distribution is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, participants will be
issued shares of the Trust at the higher of net asset value of 95% of the market
price. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Trust shares at such time,
or if the Trust declares a dividend or other distribution payable only in cash,
the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy Trust shares in the
open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the participants'
accounts. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases, the market
price exceeds the net asset value of the Trust's shares, the average per share
purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the
Trust's shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Trust. In
circumstances in which the net asset value of Trust shares is more than 5% below
their market price, participants in the Plan will be issued shares through the
Plan at a price exceeding net asset value.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to his
account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any
fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's notice of election
to participate in or withdraw from the Plan must be received by the Plan Agent
before the record date for a dividend in order to be given effect with respect
to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting dividends or
distributions. The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of
dividends and distributions will be paid by the Trust. There will be no
brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Trust as a
result of dividends or distributions payable either in stock or in cash.
However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection
with the reinvestment of dividends or distributions.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days' written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010, or by phone at 1-800-730-6001.
