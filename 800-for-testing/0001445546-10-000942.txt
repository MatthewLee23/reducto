                  Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and/or Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four
Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into
account the information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements
include all statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact.
For example, forward-looking statements include the use of words such as
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may,"
"should," "would" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or
outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the
information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the
Advisor and/or Sub-Advisor and their respective representatives only as of the
date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these
forward-looking statements to reflect events and circumstances that arise after
the date hereof.


                         Performance and Risk Disclosure

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.


                             How to Read This Report

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of Four
Corners are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are
spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information, this
report and other Fund regulatory filings.

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (FCT)
                               Semi-Annual Report
                                November 30, 2009

Dear Shareholders:

The year 2009 was more positive for the U.S. and global markets, which eased the
minds of economists and investors alike. Many economists believe that the
recession that began in December 2007 ended in March 2009. In fact, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average's total return from March 9 (the statistical end of the
bear market) to November 30, 2009, was 61.59%. Of course, no one can guarantee
that this trend will continue, but the economy has continued to rise and most
investors have found it easier to open their financial statements since March.

First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") has always believed that in order to
be successful in reaching your financial goals, you should be invested for the
long term. A long-term investor understands that the market, from a historical
perspective, has always experienced ups and downs. But history has shown that
the patient investor is typically rewarded over the long term. We have always
believed that staying invested in quality products and having a long-term
perspective can help investors reach their financial goals.

The report you hold contains detailed information about your investment in First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"). It contains
a portfolio commentary from the Fund's portfolio management team that provides a
market recap for the period, a performance analysis and a market and Fund
outlook. Additionally, the report provides the Fund's financial statements for
the period covered by the report. I encourage you to read this document and
discuss it with your financial advisor.

Since its inception, First Trust has been through many types of markets. We
remain committed to bringing you quality investment solutions regardless of the
inevitable volatility the market experiences. We offer a variety of products
that can fit many financial plans to help those investors seeking long-term
investment success. As well, we are committed to making available up-to-date
information about your investments so you and your financial advisor have
current information on your portfolio.

We continue to value our relationship with you, and we thank you for the
opportunity to assist you in achieving your financial goals.

Sincerely,


/s/ James A. Bowen

                                   Commentary

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There
can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The
Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

Market Recap

The six months ended November 30, 2009 were an extraordinary period for the
Senior Loan market. The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the "Index") had a return
of 16.32% during the period, and is up 47.29% calendar year to November 30,
2009. After the worst year in Senior Loan market history in 2008, the Senior
Loan market has followed in 2009 with the best performance in its history.

The biggest driver of 2007's and 2008's sell-off was technical, as many funds,
including FCT, were forced to sell assets and reduce leverage as global asset
prices declined in the wake of the sub-prime crisis. As a reminder, this
sell-off was occurring at the same time that default rates were at historically
low levels.

2009 has been a near mirror image of this, as positive technical conditions have
driven strong performance at the same time as default rates were hitting record
highs and recovery rates were hitting record lows. Demand for loans was
broad-based in 2009, with investors seeking to take advantage of the low
prices/wide spreads at which loans were trading. The Index began 2009 at an
average price of 62%, which provided a lot of cushion for investors to absorb
credit losses and still earn strong returns. As a result, the market saw inflows


                                                                          Page 3

of nearly $3 billion into U.S. open-end senior loan funds after 2008's outflows
of over $4 billion.(1) When combined with other sources of demand, this created
a strong backdrop to drive prices higher.

Likewise, supply was weak during most of 2009. Since spreads were so wide, most
companies were unable to issue new loans on terms that were affordable to them,
which resulted in very little new issuance. Additionally, there was a lot of new
issue activity in the high-yield bond and equity markets, and some of the
proceeds from those markets were used to prepay bank loans, reducing the
outstanding pool of bank loans by over 6% as of September 25, 2009.(2) In
summary, a combination of limited, if any, forced selling, increased demand, and
reduced supply have created the strong technical conditions that have driven the
year's dramatic rally.

Fundamental conditions, on the other hand, have been very weak. While many
borrowers reported earnings for the third quarter of 2009 that were higher than
previous quarters, they are still generally well below the earnings levels which
existed prior to the credit crisis. Additionally, many borrowers were leveraged
with record amounts of debt on pre-crisis peak cycle earnings, which makes their
quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement insufficient to enable them to
service their debt.(3) Consequently, default rates and amendment activity have
been at record levels. The lagging 12-month (LTM) default rate by principal
amount climbed to a record-high 10.81% at the end of November 2009, from 3.75%
at year-end 2008.(4) Additionally, there have been a significant amount of
companies that have amended financial covenants as they have missed their
earnings targets.(5) Typically, these amendments result in companies having to
pay fees and higher interest rates, and we have seen the positive economic
impact of this in the Fund.

In the first quarter of 2009, there was a global flight to quality across many
asset classes as equities hit cyclical lows. In the loan market, we saw this
flight to quality as higher-rated loans outperformed lower-rated loans. In the
last two quarters, however, as investors have embraced risk and sought yield, we
have seen a reversal of this and a flight to risk. This has resulted in
lower-rated loans meaningfully outperforming higher-rated loans. While the
Index has returned 47.29%(6) through November 2009, double B-rated loans, which
are higher than average quality in the loan market, have returned 33.16%,(7)
while at the other end of the spectrum, CCC-rated loans have returned 82.85%.(8)
This bifurcation of returns by risk category has been a big driver of senior
loan funds' relative performance based on their asset composition.

Performance Analysis

FCT generated a market value total return(9) of 10.39%, (including market price
change and dividends), for the six months ended November 30, 2009. The Fund's
net asset value ("NAV") total return(10) was 15.83% over the same period. The
NAV return trailed the Index return by -0.49% for the six months ended November
30, 2009. The Fund's performance includes the negative impact of fees, expenses,
and un-invested cash balances which are not part of the benchmark return. FCT's
NAV return lagged the "pure-play" peer group average by -3.92% and the broad
peer group average by -10.60%.(11) The Fund's closing price on November 30, 2009
was $10.86, which represented a -18.77% discount to its NAV, compared to the
Fund's discount to NAV of -14.84% six months earlier on May 31, 2009. During the
six-month period ended November 30, 2009, the Fund's NAV fluctuated from a low
of $11.79 to high of $13.57, a difference of $1.78 per Common Share, whereas the
market price of the Fund closed as low as $9.62 and as high as $11.32 over the
period, a difference of $1.70 per Common Share.

The Fund's income declined during the period primarily as a result of lower
London Inter-Bank Offer Rates ("LIBOR") and a smaller asset base. The dividend
distribution totaled $0.22 per Common Share during the six months ended November
30, 2009, which represented a 33.95% decrease from the prior six months ended
May 31, 2009. Based on the Fund's current dividend, FCT's distribution rate is
3.59% (calculated on the Fund's share price) and 2.92% (based on the Fund's NAV)
as of November 30, 2009. The last twelve month's dividends produced a Fund yield
based on price of 4.98%, which was lower than the pure-play peer group average
price yield of 5.98% and lower than the broad peer group average price yield of
7.25%.

FCT maintains pure-play exposure to the 1st lien, floating-rate senior loan
asset class. FCT includes 100% floating-rate assets with less than 1% 2nd lien
loans and less than 1% high-yield bonds. This asset composition differs from
many of the funds in its peer group, which may have more fixed-rate assets,
including high-yield bonds, and more 2nd lien loans. We believe that this
difference in asset composition has a meaningful impact on relative performance,
particularly in periods where riskier assets are outperforming and short-term
rates are very low.

We have deliberately reduced the Fund's leverage. While senior loan funds had
historically been structured with target leverage, including preferred stock, of
close to 40%, that was also in an environment where loan prices were more stable
than they have been in recent years. While we understand that lower leverage can
result in underperformance and lower yields during rising markets, we believe
that, given the higher correlation to global markets and higher volatility in
the loan market, it is prudent to maintain lower levels of leverage than existed
prior to the recent credit crisis. During the period, the Fund purchased
pursuant to a tender offer or redeemed all of its outstanding Series A and
Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares. The Fund's leverage is now entirely in
the form of debt, which also limits the amount of leverage that the Fund can
have.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are very pleased with the market rally and the Fund's performance during the
last six months. Our investment strategy remains unchanged, namely: to invest in
the higher credit quality portion of the non-investment grade loan market. We
continue to believe that this strategy over the long term may result in higher
risk-adjusted returns for investors as we expect to see less NAV erosion and
less volatility than higher risk, yield-focused strategies.

Market & Fund Outlook

2009 saw record default rates, and we expect the default rate to decline but
remain at elevated levels. We have seen a recent decline in the pace of defaults
and downgrades, but there are still many outstanding loans that were
overleveraged on peak cycle earnings, and some of them are expected to default.
That said, we do believe that current conditions are a classic example of the
cliche "the best of loans are made in the worst of times." While we have seen
what we consider to be a permanent degradation in some structural protections
that were historically afforded to loan investors, the loans that have been
launched in recent months are some of the most appealing we have seen in years.
Consequently, we intend to actively participate in the new issue Senior Loan
market in an attempt to both maintain high credit quality and help to improve
yield.

Notwithstanding the market's dramatic year-to-date returns, it is important to
note that the run-up has occurred from historically low levels, and the market
still offers good value at current levels compared to historical levels.
Additionally, the loan asset class continues to benefit from very low duration.
While this has obviously resulted in lower yields as rates have declined, we
believe it appeals to investors who are looking for credit spread with little
duration risk. Consequently, while we remain very cautious about fundamental
economic conditions and absolute leverage levels, we continue to believe that
there will be ongoing demand for well structured Senior Loans, which should add
to relative stability for the asset class compared to 2008's volatility.

 11 The "pure-play" peer group consists of a smaller subset (FCM, FCT, PPR, TLI
    and VVR) of the broad peer group, which invests almost exclusively in
    Senior Loans. We believe that these "pure-play" funds are generally more
    comparable to the Fund than the broad peer group, as the non-senior loan
    holdings of the "pure-play" funds are routinely less than 5% of such funds.
    Of the broad peer group, 11 of the 16 total funds invest a material portion
    of their assets in high-yield bonds, emerging markets debt or other types
    of corporate debt securities.

_______________

(a)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
     assets applicable to Common Shares.
(b)  All or a portion of the investments are available to serve as collateral on

     As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may be
     substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
(e)  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates
     which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base lending rate
     plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
     offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Interbank
     Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more United
     States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate.
(f)  This Senior Loan Interest was privately rated upon issuance. The rating
     agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the rating.
(g)  This DIP facility is partially drawn per Debtor-In-Possession Credit
     Agreement dated March 3, 2009.

     to Financial Statements).
(n)  This investment is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note
     whereby 1.00% of interest per annum is to be paid in cash and 13.75% of
     interest per annum is to be paid by the issuer, at its option (i) entirely
     in cash, (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii) in a
     combination of (i) and (ii). Interest is to be paid semi-annually; however,
     the issuer is in default and income is not being accrued.
(o)  This investment is fair valued in accordance with valuation procedures
     adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees.
(p)  Aggregate cost for financial reporting purposes, which approximates the
     aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes. As of November 30, 2009,
     the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all investments in which
     there was an excess of value over tax cost was $621,499 and the aggregate

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2009 (Unaudited)

                               1. Fund Description

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. Significant Accounting Policies

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. Portfolio Valuation:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is calculated by dividing
the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued interest), less all
liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends declared but unpaid and any
borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred
Shares, by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio investments, at fair value according
to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of
the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties.
In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations
are deemed unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust
Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's
investments. Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal
market for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities),
but before the Fund values its assets, that could materially affect NAV, First
Trust may use a fair value method to value the Fund's investments. The use of
fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by
the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940
Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. If the pricing
service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior Loan or
such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior Loan at a
fair value according to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio investments listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
investments are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Investments traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio investments traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as
of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such investments. Portfolio investments
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding investments traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in less than 60 days when purchased are valued at amortized cost.

The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

            o  Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
               identical securities. An active market is a market in which
               transactions for the security occur with sufficient frequency and
               volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.


                                                                         Page 23

                          November 30, 2009 (Unaudited)


            o  Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly
               or indirectly, and include the following:
                 o   Quoted prices for similar securities in active markets.
                 o   Quoted prices for identical or similar securities in
                     markets that are non-active. A non-active market is a
                     market where there are few transactions for the security,
                     the prices are not current, or price quotations vary
                     substantially either over time or among market makers, or
                     in which little information is released publicly.
                 o   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                     security (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                     observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                     prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and
                     default rates).
                 o   Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                     observable market data by correlation or other means.
            o  Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
               inputs reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
               assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
               security.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risks associated with investing in those investments. A
summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of November 30,
2009 is included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. Credit Default Swaps:

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes or to
gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. The Fund may be either the buyer or seller in a credit
default swap transaction. The "buyer" in a credit default swap contract is
obligated to pay the "seller" a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default on the underlying reference
obligation has occurred. If an event of default occurs, the seller must pay the
buyer the full notional value, or "par value," of the reference obligation.
Credit default swap transactions are either "physical delivery" settled or
"cash" settled. Physical delivery entails the actual delivery of the reference
asset to the seller in exchange for payment of the full par value of the
reference asset. Cash settled entails a net cash payment from the seller to the
buyer based on the difference of the par value of the reference asset and the
current value of the reference asset that may have, through default, lost some,
most or all of its value. An event of default may be a grace period extension,
obligation acceleration, repudiation/moratorium, or restructuring.

Buying a credit default swap contract involves the risk that the contract may
expire worthless and the credit risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its
payment obligations to the Fund in the event of default. Selling a credit
default swap contract involves greater risks than if the Fund had invested in
the reference obligation directly. The Fund will segregate cash or liquid assets
in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swap
contracts of which it is a seller. Additionally, the Fund maintains cash or
liquid assets for the full notional amount of the credit default swap contracts
of which it is a seller. The Fund may only enter into such transactions with
counterparties rated A- or higher.

Credit default swap contracts are marked to market daily based upon quotations
from brokers or market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation (depreciation). For a credit default swap contract sold
by the Fund, payment of the agreed-upon amount made by the Fund in the event of
default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of the
referenced debt obligation purchased/received. As of November 30, 2009, the Fund
had no outstanding credit default swaps.

C. Repurchase Agreements:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period.

This arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not subject to market
fluctuations during the Fund's holding period. The value of the collateral is at
all times at least equal to the total amount of the repurchase obligation,
including interest. In the event of counterparty default, the Fund has the right
to use the collateral to offset losses incurred. There is potential loss to the
Fund in the event the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to
dispose of the collateral investments, including the risk of a possible decline
in the value of the underlying investments during the period while the Fund
seeks to assert its rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the
creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into
repurchase agreements to evaluate potential risks. As of November 30, 2009, the
Fund had no open repurchase agreements.

D. Investment Transactions and Investment Income:

Investment transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from investment transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Investments purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such
investments is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid
assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments. As of November 30, 2009, the Fund had no
when-issued or delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

E. Unfunded Loan Commitments:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
approximately $1,068,393 as of November 30, 2009. The Fund is obligated to fund
these loan commitments at the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation
from the commitments is $559 at November 30, 2009.

F. Restricted Investments:

The Fund invests in restricted investments, which are investments that cannot be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Prior to registration, restricted investments may only be
resold in transactions exempt from registration. The Fund held restricted
investments at November 30, 2009 as shown in the following table. The Fund does
not have the right to demand that such investments be registered. These
investments are valued according to the valuation procedures as stated in the
Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a discount to
the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There are no
unrestricted investments with the same maturity dates and yields for these
issuers.

<FN>
(1) Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on July 31,
2007.
</FN>
</TABLE>


G. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and any Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund, if AMP Shares are issued and outstanding at the time, in
proportion to the total dividends paid for the year. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the at the
time, Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by
the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investments held by the
Fund, timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions made
by the Fund.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2009 is as follows:

Distributions paid from:

Ordinary Income................................      $    21,941,351

As of May 31, 2009, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income..................      $       373,047
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation).....         (101,071,467)
Accumulated Capital and Other Losses ..........          (81,651,288)

H. Income Taxes:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry realized capital losses forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. The
Fund is subject to certain limitations under U.S. tax rules on the use of
capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These limitations
apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership. At May 31, 2009, the Fund
had available realized capital losses of $3,984,460, $3,611,723 and $25,697,677
to offset future net capital gains through the fiscal years ended 2014, 2016 and
2017, respectively.


                                                                         Page 25

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2009 (Unaudited)


Certain losses realized after October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2009, the Fund intends to elect to defer net realized losses
incurred from November 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009 of $48,357,428.

The Fund is subject to tax accounting standards that establish a minimum
threshold for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ending
2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 remain open to federal and state audit. As of November
30, 2009, management has evaluated the application of these standards to the
Fund, and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the
Fund's financial statements for uncertain tax provisions.

I. Expenses:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.


 3. Investment Advisory Fee, Affiliated Transactions and Other Fee Arrangements

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage. L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, which are the average daily gross asset
value of the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares,
if AMP Shares are outstanding, and the principal amount of borrowings), minus
the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid dividends on any outstanding AMP
Shares, if AMP Shares are outstanding, and liabilities.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor")
serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

In accordance with certain fee arrangements, PNC Global Investment Servicing
(U.S.) Inc., an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator, Fund Accountant and
Transfer Agent. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary
of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's Custodian in
accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG, served as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar, dividend
disbursing agent and redemption agent prior to the Fund's AMP Share tender offer
and redemption transactions (see Note 5 below).

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid an annual retainer
of $10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund Complex and
an annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each subsequent trust in the First
Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of the
trusts. No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with board or
committee meetings.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $10,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $5,000 annually and each of the Chairmen
of the Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee is paid
$2,500 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation paid by the
trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex and divided among those trusts. Trustees
are also reimbursed by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent
Trustee and each Committee chairman will serve two-year terms which ended on
December 31, 2009, before rotating to serve as a chairman of another committee
or as Lead Independent Trustee. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no
compensation from the trusts for serving in such capacities.

                     4. Purchases and Sales of Investments

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2009 were $111,865,800 and
$114,277,960, respectively.

                       5. Auction Market Preferred Shares

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As described below, as of November
30, 2009, the Fund did not have any Series A AMP Shares or Series B AMP Shares
outstanding.

On August 28, 2009, the Fund commenced a tender offer for up to 100% of its
outstanding Series A and Series B AMP Shares at a purchase price equal to 97% of
the liquidation preference of $25,000 per AMP Share, plus any unpaid dividends
accrued through the expiration date of the offer. On September 14, 2009, the
Fund increased the purchase price to 100% of the liquidation preference per AMP
Share ($25,000 per AMP Share), plus any unpaid dividends accrued through the
expiration date of the offer. As of the expiration of the tender offer at 5:00
p.m., Eastern time, on September 28, 2009, 1,509 of the 1,600 outstanding Series
A AMP Shares and 1,549 of the 1,600 outstanding Series B AMP Shares were validly

tendered in the offer. The Fund paid the purchase price for such validly
tendered AMP Shares by depositing the purchase price with the depositary for the
offer, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas.

On October 12, 2009, First Trust announced the Fund's intention to redeem its
remaining outstanding AMP Shares in the principal amount of $2,275,000 Series A
AMP Shares and $1,275,000 Series B AMP Shares. The Fund completed such
redemption of the Series A and Series B AMP Shares on November 18, 2009.
Following completion of such redemption, the Fund no longer has any Series A AMP
Shares or Series B AMP Shares outstanding.

For the six months ended November 30, 2009, tender offer and redemption
transactions in AMP Shares were as follows:

</TABLE>


                          6. Revolving Credit Facility

The Fund has entered into a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") with
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be used as
leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May 13,
2010 and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a secured
line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made
to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after
any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of
the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit
Facility is $150,000,000. For the six months ended November 30, 2009, the
average amount outstanding was $62,178,415. The loans under the Credit Facility
funded by the Conduit Lender bear interest for each settlement period at a rate
per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the Conduit Lender. The loans
under the Credit Facility funded by the Secondary Lenders bear interest for each
settlement period at a per annum rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate for the
settlement period plus 7.50% or (ii) the alternate base rate plus 5.00%. For the
six months ended November 30, 2009, the Fund had no loans under the Credit
Facility funded by the Secondary Lender. The high and low annual interest rates
for the loans under the Credit Facility funded by the Conduit Lender during the
six months ended November 30, 2009, were 0.83% and 0.27%, respectively, with a
weighted average interest rate of 0.39%. The annual interest rate in effect for
such loans at November 30, 2009 was 0.27%. The Fund also pays additional
borrowing costs, which include a program fee of 1.25% and a liquidity fee of
0.50% per year. On May 15, 2009 in connection with the annual extension of the
expiration date of the Credit Facility, the Fund paid upfront closing fees of
$1,125,000, which are being amortized over a one-year period. Such expenses are
included in "Interest and fees on loan" on the Statement of Operations.

                             7. Risk Considerations

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

Investment and Market Risk: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the investments owned by the Fund. The value of these investments, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Investment prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines that it
is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is
impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and
trading in the investments is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

Lower Grade Debt Instruments: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally lower grade. These lower grade debt instruments may become the subject
of bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise subsequently default as to the repayment
of principal and/or payment of interest or be downgraded to ratings in the lower
rating categories. Lower grade debt instruments tend to be less liquid than
higher grade debt instruments.

Leverage Risk: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. The Fund borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing
program and through the issuance of Preferred Shares, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares, with
respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in
compliance with certain Credit Facility provisions, the Fund may not be


                                                                         Page 27

permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or Preferred Shares or purchase
Common Shares or Preferred Shares.

Senior Loan Risk: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. The value of the collateral may not
equal the Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline
below the principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's
investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the
borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the
stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or
substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under
collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior
Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of
non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be
readily liquidated.

                               8. Indemnification

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              9. Subsequent Events

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through
January 25, 2010, the date the financial statements were issued, and has
determined that there were the following subsequent events:

On December 21, 2009, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0325 per share to
Common Shareholders of record January 6, 2010, payable January 15, 2010.

On January 20, 2009, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.035 per share to Common
Shareholders of record February 3, 2010, payable February 16, 2010.

Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PNC
Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

     (1) If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at the
         time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal to
         the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii) 95% of the
         market price on that date.

     (2) If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
         Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
         purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere,
         for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price
         for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed
         its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by
         the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation,
         resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or
         distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The
         Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions received in cash to
         purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of the
         valuation date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
         purchases is necessary to comply with federal securities laws. Interest
         will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PNC Global Investment
Servicing (U.S.) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.
