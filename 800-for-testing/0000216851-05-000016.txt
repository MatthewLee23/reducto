For the third consecutive year, the major energy indices outperformed the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index. In this annual report we share
with you our performance for the past year and provide our current perspective
on the energy markets.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW

Performance

Petroleum & Resources outperformed both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average in 2004. Most of the investments in the Fund benefited from
the surging demand and price environment for oil and gas. The return on net
assets, including income and capital gains distributions for the calendar year,
was an exceptional 23.3%, far surpassing the 10.9% return for the S&P 500 and
the 5.3% return of the Dow Industrials. On a market value basis, the Fund's
return was 14.4%. Strong supply/demand dynamics and the geopolitical turmoil in
major oil-producing countries continued to drive oil and gas equities. Our cash
position, non-energy holdings, and our positions in international companies not
included in the Index caused us to lag the Dow Jones Energy Index for the
entire year. Through December 17, 2004, the Fund's total return was 22.2%
compared to the Energy Index's 28.3%. On December 20, Dow Jones discontinued
publishing the Energy Index and established a new Oil and Gas Index in its
place, with no representation of coal companies. For comparative purposes, in
the remainder of this letter references to annual returns of the sectors of the
Fund and the Dow Jones Energy Index will be for the year through December 17.

Following a strong rebound in the fourth quarter of 2003, energy stocks
continued to outperform in 2004. The first quarter witnessed an increase in the
Petroleum & Resources portfolio of 3.3% compared to a 1.7% rise in the S&P and
a modest decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Benefiting from the
perception of supply constraints in the market and the drilling programs of the
oil companies, oil service and equipment companies in our portfolio gained 16%
in the quarter, besting the 13% return of the service subsector of the Dow
Jones Energy Index. Within the Energy Index, the stronger performance shifted
to exploration and production companies during the second quarter, providing a
return of 13%. Strong demand and apparent supply constraints biased the stocks
upward through the third quarter of the year. The hurricane season pressured an
already tight supply/demand balance and drove energy prices higher in the
second half of the year, with commodity prices peaking in October. Equity
prices in general reflected the commodity move upward, but to a lesser degree.
Companies focused primarily on finding and developing oil and gas reserves,
however, experienced stock movements greater than the commodity prices. Our
holdings in Amerada Hess, Burlington Resources and Devon each gained more than
57%. The larger, more diversified oil companies returned 21.8% during the same
time period, with Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco and BP delivering the best
performance of the international oil stocks in our portfolio. Our investments
in the underperforming equities of Royal Dutch/Shell, which are not included in
the Energy Index, were a significant drag on the portfolio's performance. Coal
prices and stocks also rose during the year, reflecting rising demand and a
strong pricing environment.

Pipelines continued to recover financially in 2004, resulting in a 21.7%
increase in the pipeline stocks in the Energy Index and a 65% increase in our
pipeline holdings. Utilities also participated in the move as their index rose
20.2% during the year and our holdings, led by utilities with exploration and
production exposure, increased 22%. The final month of the year witnessed a
correction in oil and gas prices. During December, energy stocks underperformed
the general market due to an oil price decline of 11% and a 19% price
correction in natural gas. Warm weather and sizable crude and product
inventories tempered enthusiasm for oil and gas stocks as 2004 drew to a close.
While increasing during the year, our chemical and paper holdings delivered
returns lower than those provided by energy stocks. The materials sector of our
portfolio gained 9% and industrial stocks, led by General Electric, returned
19%.

Oil Industry

At year-end 2003, our outlook for 2004 was for oil prices to settle in the
upper end of the $22-$28 range and perhaps to correct more as OPEC production
increased. This estimate seemed lofty at the time but was justified by low
inventories and rising worldwide demand. However, tight crude and product
inventories, stronger than anticipated demand, especially from China, and a
large speculative market all conspired to drive oil prices higher than we and
most other analysts anticipated. The actual average price realization in 2004
for oil was $41.25 per barrel.

The year was characterized by volatility and extremes. The early months of the
year saw a trading range for crude oil of $32-$36 per barrel due to a tight
crude oil market, low inventories and the OPEC resolution to lower its
production quota. Demand both in China and in the U.S. gasoline market
influenced the upward move in oil prices. Unrest in Iraq and other countries
such as Nigeria, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia contributed to the speculative
component of the crude price.

As the year progressed, OPEC increased the quota three times, to a level of 27
million barrels per day by November. Production levels exceeded quotas for most
of the year but record prices for crude and gasoline

                                                                             3

                      LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS (CONTINUED)

continued. The low U.S. crude inventories were not replenished early in the
year and the severe hurricane season exacerbated the domestic crude supply
problem. Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan inflicted severe damage on the
Gulf Coast and caused major delays in oil shipments and the temporary shutdown
of refineries. While the oil production losses along the coast were minimal,
the incremental disruption to supply only brought more pressure to bear on the
markets. Compounding the hurricane season's effect was the news that Russia's
biggest oil-exporting company, Yukos, might be forced to halt operations due to
tax debts. The tight oil markets could not absorb the potential Yukos loss, as
it supplied 2% of the world market. By the final quarter of the year, these new
pressures, added to strong demand, the uncertain flow of oil exports from Iraq,
Venezuelan political instability and a Nigerian labor strike all converged on
the markets. The benchmark for U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, soared to
$55 per barrel on October 22. Since that peak, higher OPEC output, warm East
Coast weather, and the return to production of a large portion of the Gulf of
Mexico combined to replenish U.S. crude oil inventories. Prices corrected and
ended the year at $42.15 per barrel, 33% higher than the start of the year.
Petroleum product prices such as gasoline also set record prices and, despite
the decline in December, ended the year 20% higher than at the beginning of the
year.

Natural Gas and Coal

Natural gas prices increased during 2004 but to a much lesser extent than crude
and averaged $5.89 per thousand cubic feet for the year, or a 10% increase over
the prior year. Prices spiked early in the year as cold weather and
expectations for strong industrial demand prevailed. Helped by crude oil
prices, natural gas sustained mid $5 per thousand cubic feet pricing despite
weather not being much of a factor and healthy inventory levels as the winter
heating season ended. Long term concern regarding U.S. natural gas production
continues to be reflected in pricing. The domestic industry has not experienced
incremental production increases in recent years despite active drilling
programs. The marginal cost to produce natural gas rose during 2004, reflecting
the continued maturation of the North American producing base. Liquefied
natural gas (LNG) imports, though still representing less than 2% of U.S. gas
demand, increased during the year. Natural gas pricing drifted lower during the
early summer months until the frequency and severity of hurricanes curtailed
output in the Gulf of Mexico. Since approximately 30% of North American gas
production is from the Gulf Region, the hurricane-related shutdowns had an
immediate impact. While most of the lost production was temporary, the concern
over the lack of spare production capacity was heightened. Prices remained
strong into the beginning of the heating season and closed the year just over
$6 per thousand cubic feet. Coal prices increased again in 2004, with spot
prices almost double those of 2002. Improved supply/demand conditions in key
producing regions led to the increases both in spot and contract prices,
especially in the Northern and Central Appalachian basins.

INVESTMENT RESULTS

Net assets of the Corporation on December 31, 2004 were $618,887,401 or $28.16
per share on 21,979,676 shares outstanding. This compares with $522,941,279 or
$24.06 per share on 21,736,777 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2004 was $8,924,453 compared to $8,134,186 for 2003.
These earnings are equivalent to $0.41 and $0.38 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. In 2004, our
0.56% expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) was once again at a low
level compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $18,979,327 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $185,072,550 at December
31, 2003 to $275,422,891 at year end, a 49% increase.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Total dividends and distributions paid in 2004 were $1.32 per share compared to
$1.19 in 2003. As announced on November 13, 2004, a year-end distribution
consisting of investment income of $0.14 and capital gains of $0.79 was made on
December 27, 2004, both realized and taxable in 2004. On January 13, 2005, an
additional distribution of $0.13 per share was declared payable March 1, 2005,
representing the balance of undistributed net investment income and capital
gains earned in 2004 and an initial distribution from 2005 net investment
income, all taxable to shareholders in 2005.

OUTLOOK FOR 2005

Crude Oil

The relentless rise in commodity prices, particularly oil and gas, has
contributed to strong stock performance in the energy industry for the past
three years. Many of the factors that contributed to the rise in prices are
still in effect. However, the initial move in crude prices in 2005 was a $3
decline as inventories were high and weather, especially in the Northeast, was
warm, resulting in less use of home heating fuels. OPEC (excluding Iraq)
entered the year promising to curtail production to prevent significant
inventory builds. The organization will meet early in the year to

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


determine the appropriate quota necessary to maintain a desired price level.
While the official price range is lower, it is believed that a U.S. price below
$40 will trigger a quota reduction. Supply from Russia and the changes within
Yukos and the Russian government will influence worldwide supply. Supply
changes due to conflicts and disruptions in the Middle East, Nigeria and
Venezuela cannot currently be quantified but the premium to normalized oil
prices resulting from the uncertainty will remain. Worldwide demand growth is
expected to remain strong. China accounted for 40% of the incremental demand
last year and the sustainability of growth in China, as well as India and other
growth markets, is crucial to supporting high oil prices. Current robust demand
and the lack of increases in productive capacity, combined with the unknown
geopolitical issues, contribute to a strong price outlook. U.S. demand remains
strong despite the jump in crude and gasoline prices. However, a slowdown in
China is likely, especially in the second half of 2005, and OPEC's compliance
with its quotas may again set the price. Our 2005 outlook for oil prices is a
wide range of $35-$40 for the year. If Saudi Arabia defends the market
coincident with terrorist threats and other supply disruptions threatening the
supply/demand balance, the near term floor price is likely to be $30 per
barrel, a figure which used to be considered high.

Natural Gas and Coal

Prices for natural gas early in the year will be significantly influenced by
weather. Inventories are abundant and the absence of cold weather in the
Northeast is creating pressure on the commodity. One year ago, natural gas
prices were approximately $1 lower and the weather was much colder, reflecting
the correlation to crude oil pricing. The lack of new sources of gas entering
the supply stream and rising costs for developing new supplies provide support
for current prices. Exploration and production companies will continue to spend
for new reserves at the same time the larger integrated companies are
concentrating on LNG projects. Over the next year, natural gas volumes and
pricing will vary with crude prices, weather and inventory levels. Our estimate
is for a slightly lower gas price this year, dropping to $5.75 for an average
as compared to $5.89 for 2004. An anticipated pickup in industrial demand
should offset lower weather-related demand. Coal prices should remain strong
throughout the year as prices reflect strong demand. Underinvestment in coal
facilities as well as complex permitting procedures slowed the investment in
reserve development in recent years. The pricing environment will reflect that
dynamic as economic growth, especially from the steel industry, pressures
prices during the next year. Longer term, the comparative cost advantage of
coal versus oil and gas should provide a strong operating environment for coal.

In anticipation of lower average prices for oil and natural gas, we have
reduced our holdings in a number of the exploration and development companies,
whose performance is generally more tied to commodity prices. Investments have
been redirected to international and domestic integrated companies as well as
oil service companies. The large integrated companies should report lesser
declines in income due to lower oil prices. The drillers and service companies
are expected to continue to benefit from higher levels of exploration activity
both domestically and abroad. We have avoided many basic materials stocks due
to the volatility of metal and other materials prices. As these begin to
stabilize at reasonable levels, there may be opportunities to invest more in
the sector.

As noted, investment returns from the energy sector have been exceptional for
three years in a row. After a long period of under-appreciation by investors,
valuations are now more appropriate given the prospects of the companies. We
expect strong earnings from the sector in 2005, barring unforeseen events, and
therefore the stocks should perform reasonably well. General market returns are
expected to be in the 7-10% range for the year; we anticipate that for the
fourth year in a row the energy sector will do as well as, if not better than,
the market as a whole.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation
over the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the restriction
that shares can only be repurchased when the discount of the market price of
the shares from the net asset value is 6.5% or greater.

From the beginning of 2005 through January 20, 2005, 13,500 shares have been
repurchased under the program.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation's investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its
investment transactions are set forth in the Corporation's registration
statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on national securities
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions And Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2004 was $372,148,846, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $275,649,014, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $283,381,833 and $7,732,819, respectively.
As of December 31, 2004, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $1,031,243
of undistributed ordinary income and $1,296,861 of undistributed long-term
capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2004
were classified as ordinary income of $9,971,538 and capital gain of
$18,602,737. In comparison, distributions paid by the Corporation during the
year ended December 31, 2003 were classified as ordinary income of $8,321,192
and capital gain of $17,048,026. The distributions are determined in accordance
with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within the
Corporation's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under income tax regulations.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee, and no one
person is primarily responsible for making recommendations to that committee.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2004 were $72,588,871 and
$67,947,551, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the market risk of
an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written
option. The risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium
originally paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of December 31,
2004 can be found on page 16.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2004 were as follows:

The Corporation has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 895,522 shares of the Corporation's Common
Stock at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are
exercisable beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend
and vest over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and
extend over the period during which the option is exercisable. The stock
appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise
their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by
the Corporation during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2004, there were
129,447 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $18.35
per share. During 2004, the Corporation granted options, including stock
appreciation rights, for 19,241 shares of Common Stock with an original
weighted average exercise price of $22.86 per share. During the year, stock
appreciation rights relating to 20,145 stock option shares were exercised at a
weighted average market price of $25.31 per share and the stock options
relating to these rights which had a weighted average exercise price of $13.00
per share were cancelled. At December 31, 2004, there were outstanding
exercisable options to purchase 42,060 common shares at $10.04-$23.65 per share
(weighted average price of $18.25) and unexercisable options to purchase 86,483
common shares at $14.26-$23.65 per share (weighted average price of $19.08).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding exercisable and
unexercisable options was 5.32 years and 6.18 years, respectively. The total
compensation expense recognized in 2004 for the stock option and stock
appreciation rights plan was $435,091. At December 31, 2004, there were 260,373
shares available for future option grants.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment which
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses
transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or
services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or
that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. Currently, the
Corporation recognizes compensation cost for a stock option award over the
award's vesting period. The revised FAS 123 is effective as of the beginning of
the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.
The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact it will have on its
operations and financial statements.

5. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation provides retirement benefits for its employees under a
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-contributory
nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based on years of
service and compensation during the last five years of employment.

The Corporation uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

              Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and
              costs are:
                                                        2004  2003

</TABLE>

The assumption for the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on the
actual long-term historical returns realized by the plan assets, weighted
according to the current asset mix.

The asset allocations at December 31, 2004 and 2003, by asset category are as
follows:

</TABLE>

Equity securities include Common Stock of The Adams Express Company, the
Corporation's non-controlled affiliate, in the amount of $201,285 (6% of total
plan assets) and $180,012 (7% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2004, and
2003, respectively.

The primary objective of the Corporation's pension plan is to provide capital
appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital through a portfolio
of stocks and fixed income securities. The equity portion of the portfolio may
range from 50% to 75% of total portfolio assets. The fixed income portion of
the portfolio may range from 25% to 50% of total portfolio assets and cash may
range from 0% to 25% of total portfolio assets. Subject to these allocation
ranges, the portfolio may be invested in any of the following securities:
common stocks, preferred stocks, American Depository Receipts, foreign
securities, mutual funds, convertible securities, municipal bonds, corporate
bonds, US government securities and US government agency securities.

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Corporation anticipates
making contributions in the amount of approximately $630,000 to the plans in
2005.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at December 31, 2004, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. By their
nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and
actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements. Several factors that could materially affect the
Corporation's actual results are the performance of the portfolio of stocks
held by the Corporation, the conditions in the U.S. and international

PRIVACY POLICY

In order to conduct its business, Petroleum & Resources Corporation collects
and maintains certain nonpublic personal information about our stockholders of
record with respect to their transactions in shares of our securities. This
information includes the stockholder's address, tax identification or Social
Security number, share balances, and dividend elections. We do not collect or
maintain personal information about stockholders whose shares of our securities
are held in "street name" by a financial institution such as a bank or broker.

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you, our other
stockholders or our former stockholders to third parties unless necessary to
process a transaction, service an account or as otherwise permitted by law.

To protect your personal information internally, we restrict access to
nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to those employees who
need to know that information to provide services to our stockholders. We also
maintain certain other safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal
information.

 This report, including the financial statements herein, is transmitted to the
 stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation for their information. It is
 not a prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase
 or sale of shares of the Corporation or of any securities mentioned in the
 report. The rates of return will vary and the principal value of an investment
 will fluctuate. Shares, if sold, may be worth more or less than their original
 cost. Past performance is not indicative of future investment results.

                                                                             19

                     SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Petroleum & Resources?

Petroleum & Resources Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
Pacific Exchange. The stock's ticker symbol is "PEO" and may be bought and sold
through registered investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to
assist you in this regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan
(see page 21).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.peteres.com. The daily NAV is also available
on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XPEOX. The
week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers and on Mondays
in The Wall Street Journal in a table titled "Closed-End Funds." The table
compares the net asset value at the close of the week's last business day to
the market price of the shares, and shows the amount of the discount or premium.

Petroleum's daily trading is shown in the stock tables of most daily
newspapers, usually with the abbreviated form "PetRs." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Corporation at
(800) 638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Petroleum stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept in
a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend checks.
You can request direct deposit with American Stock Transfer either on-line or
by calling them at the phone number provided on page 21. At this time, AST does
not offer direct deposit of your year-end distribution checks. We have been
advised by AST that it will be able to offer this service for the 2005 year-end
distribution.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Petroleum
& Resources?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc., as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Petroleum is simple and is handled through our transfer agent.
The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of transfer. They
will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the transfer agent
stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer agent will send
you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your transfer.

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Corporation presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a)
three interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1 and
(b) a "year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the
estimated balance of the net investment income for the year and the net
realized capital gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to
receive the year-end distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this
distribution, all stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement
notice and an election card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
elections by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES & PROCEDURES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (Petroleum) follows  long-
standing  general  guidelines for the  voting  of  portfolio
company  proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility
to  vote all such proxies. The portfolio company proxies are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Petroleum uses
its  own  staff of research analysts and portfolio managers.
In  making  the  decision to invest in  a  company  for  the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyzes  is
the integrity and competency of the companys management.  We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies  managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of  the  companys
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio  companys management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the companys management.   When  we
believe  that the managements recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio   company   managements
recommendation are:

Stock Options
Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the companys overall compensation scheme.  In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the companys stock.

Corporate Control/ Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a staggered board of directors. Staggered boards are used to
help  create a roadblock to a possible takeover of a company
or   to   entrench  incumbent  management  and   board.   In
conformance  with  that policy, we will  generally  vote  in
favor  of  shareholder proposals to eliminate the  staggered
election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a  companys
charter   that   can   be  characterized  as   anti-takeover
provisions.  For  example, we generally  vote  in  favor  of
stockholder  proposals to rescind or require  a  stockholder
vote  on  anti-takeover provisions such as poison pills  and
the like.

With  respect  to  so-called  golden  parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within  the authority of the companys management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually  are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance   with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 11, 2005, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive

effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls   and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  11, 2005, the registrant's disclosure controls  and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting  (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has   materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2, above.

       (2) The certifications of the PEO and PFO pursuant to
