Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. for their information. This is not a
prospectus. The Funds have leveraged their Common Stock and intend to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with potentially higher rates of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net
asset value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may
affect the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Past performance results shown

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


The Funds utilize leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value
of their Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all
interest rate environments. To leverage, each Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these
investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock
shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio
holdings is reflected in the per share net asset value of each Fund's Common
Stock. However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve
must be positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower
than long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of
these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh
the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization
of $100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional
$50 million, creating a total value of $150 million available for investment
in long-term municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are
approximately 3% and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the
yield curve has a strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the
$50 million of Preferred Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates.
At the same time, the fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns the income
based on long-term interest rates.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term
investments, and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries
of the incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise,
narrowing the differential between short-term and long-term interest rates,
the incremental yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated
completely. At the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock
(that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may, as a
result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price of the
portfolio's investments, since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does
not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value
of the fund's Common Stock may also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Funds may invest in certain
securities whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a
floating interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse
floaters will decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase
when short-term interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may
be characterized as derivative securities and may subject the Funds to the
risks of reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of invested
principal. In addition, inverse floaters have the effect of providing
investment leverage and, as a result, the market value of such securities will
generally be more volatile than that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To
the extent the Funds invest in inverse floaters, the market value of each
Fund's portfolio and the net asset value of each Fund's shares may also be
more volatile than if the Funds did not invest in such securities. As of
November 30, 2005, the percentage of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.'s
total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 3.70%, before the deduction
of Preferred Stock. As of November 30, 2005, none of Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.'s total net assets was invested in inverse
floaters.

A Letter From the President


Dear Shareholder

As the financial markets continued to muddle their way through 2005, the
Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) advanced its monetary tightening campaign full
steam ahead. The 13th consecutive interest rate hike since June 2004 came on
December 13, bringing the target federal funds rate to 4.25%. Oil prices,
after reaching record highs on more than one occasion over the past several
months, moderated somewhat by period-end, as did inflation expectations.
Against this backdrop, most major market indexes managed to post positive
results for the current reporting period:

</TABLE>


With the kick-off of the holiday shopping season, attention turned to the
consumer, who has remained resilient even amid high energy prices and rising
interest rates. Some observers surmise that a slowdown in residential real
estate may ultimately contribute to a weakening in consumer spending. At this
juncture, the outlook remains unclear.

Equity markets moved sideways for much of 2005, notwithstanding a strong rally
in the middle of the fourth quarter. Corporate earnings have continued to
surprise on the upside and company profit margins remain high, as does
productivity. On the other hand, high energy prices, more Fed interest rate
hikes, a consumer slowdown and/or the potential for slower earnings growth
pose the greatest risks to U.S. stocks. Internationally, many markets have
benefited from strong economic statistics, trade surpluses and solid finances.
Emerging markets have had a particularly strong year, partly reflecting high
economic growth rates and positive financial reforms.

The bond market continued to be characterized by a flattening yield curve. The
difference between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yield was just seven
basis points (.07%) at period-end, compared to 40 basis points six months ago
and 134 basis points 12 months ago.

Navigating the financial markets can be a challenge, particularly during
uncertain times. With that in mind, we invite you to visit our online magazine

A Discussion With Your Funds' Portfolio Managers


The Funds remained focused on generating an attractive level of tax-exempt
income for shareholders, looking for income-enhancing opportunities as market
rates rose late in the period.


Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Over the past six months, long-term bond yields generally rose. Bond prices,
which move opposite of yields, fell as investors focused on inflationary
pressures, especially higher energy costs in the wake of the Gulf Coast
hurricanes. A strengthening U.S. economy, which grew at a faster-
than-expected 4.3% rate in the third quarter of 2005, added further to the
inflationary concerns.

The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) continued to raise short-term interest
rates at each of its meetings during the period, lifting the federal funds
target rate to 4% by period-end (and to 4.25% on December 13). With short-term
interest rates increasing more than long-term interest rates, the yield curve
continued to flatten.

During the past six months, 10-year Treasury note yields rose 49 basis points
(.49%) to 4.49%, while 30-year U.S. Treasury yields rose 37 basis points to
4.69%. Tax-exempt bond yields exhibited a similar pattern during the period.
According to Municipal Market Data, the yield on AAA-rated issues maturing in
30 years increased 29 basis points to 4.55%, while the yield on AAA-rated
issues maturing in 10 years rose 38 basis points to 3.87%.

Historically low nominal tax-exempt bond yields continued to encourage
municipalities to issue new debt and refund outstanding, higher-couponed
issues. During the past six months, almost $207 billion in new municipal bonds
was underwritten, a 16.8% increase compared to issuance during the same six
months of 2004. Year-to-date through November 30, the volume of refunding
issues increased by more than 44% on a year-over-year basis. Refunding issues
were heavily weighted in the 10-year - 20-year maturity range, putting pressure
on intermediate tax-exempt bond yields while supporting longer-term bond
prices.

Investor demand for municipal product remained positive during most of the
period. The most current statistics from the Investment Company Institute
indicate that, year-to-date through October 2005, net new cash flows into long-
term municipal bond funds exceeded $6.9 billion - a significant improvement
from the $12.7 billion net outflow seen during the same period in 2004. Solid
investor demand enabled municipal bonds to perform generally in line with
their taxable counterparts, reversing some of their recent underperformance.
We believe that attractive yield ratios relative to taxable bonds should
continue to attract both traditional and non-traditional investors to the
municipal marketplace, especially if municipal bond issuance remains
manageable.

The communities shattered by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will require
extensive reconstruction. It is too early, however, to estimate the amount of
tax-exempt debt that may be required to finance these efforts or assess the
overall impact on the municipal market. However, much of the rebuilding is
likely to be funded through federal loans and grants, and the reconstruction
will likely be spread over a number of years. Consequently, any new municipal
bond issuance prompted by the hurricanes is not likely to disrupt the tax-
exempt market in the near future.


Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


How did the Fund perform during the period?

For the six-month period ended November 30, 2005, the Common Stock of Muni
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 5.66% and 6.17%,
based on a period-end per share net asset value of $15.22 and a per share
market price of $13.96, respectively, and $.432 per share income dividends.
Over the same period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock
was +1.13%, based on a change in per share net asset value from $15.51 to
$15.22, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the +.58% average
return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for the
six-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in municipal
debt issues rated in the top four credit-rating categories. These funds can be
leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse repurchase
agreements.)



SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS                                           NOVEMBER 30, 2005



The Fund's outperformance can be attributed to a modestly overweighted
exposure to spread product - lower-quality, higher-yielding municipal bonds,
which benefited as credit spreads narrowed during the period. The high yield
municipal market continued to perform well on the back of strong demand, as
investors, looking for better yields in a low interest rate environment,
poured cash into high yield mutual funds. The Fund benefited particularly from
issues in the special tax (land secured), senior living and toll road sectors,
all of which saw gains in an otherwise down market. The Fund also benefited
from price appreciation of its holdings issued by Mississippi Systems Energy,
a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, which was downgraded after Hurricane
Katrina struck the Gulf Coast region. Ironically, the credit downgrade caused
our bonds to appreciate because it made it less probable that the securities'
call feature would be exercised. Of final note, the Fund's underweight stance
in airline bonds was a positive. We had no exposure to either Delta Air Lines,
Inc. or Northwest Airlines, both of which declared bankruptcy during the
period, in part because of the impact of higher fuel costs.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights
section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value.
As a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock may vary significantly from total investment returns
based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Portfolio activity concentrated on uncovering attractive relative value in the
municipal marketplace. Given the prospect of continued yield curve flattening,
we reduced our exposure to bonds with maturities of 10 years - 18 years while
adding to our holdings in bonds longer than 25 years. We also maintained our
strategy of purchasing bonds of issuers we believed were more likely to
defease their existing debt to help close their budget gaps. When bonds are
defeased, it typically means that the securities are retired at their first
call date, enabling the bonds to appreciate significantly. The states of
California and Massachusetts are two issuers who have been aggressive in
implementing this strategy. Purchases during the period also included higher-
coupon bonds with shorter call dates, which we believed offered attractive
relative yields and the potential for future outperformance.

For the six months ended November 30, 2005, the average yield for the Fund's
Auction Market Preferred Stock (AMPS) was 1.78% for Series M7; 1.80% for
Series T7; 1.83% for Series W7; 1.92% for Series TH7; 1.74% for Series F7; and
2.41% for Series TH28. The Fed's interest rate hikes clearly are having an
impact on the Fund's borrowing costs. The Fed raised the short-term interest
rate target 100 basis points during the six-month period (and once more on
December 13). Still, the tax-exempt yield curve remained relatively steep and
continued to generate an income benefit to the holders of Common Stock from
the leveraging of Preferred Stock. However, should the spread between short-
term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of leveraging will
decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. At the
end of the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due to AMPS, was 35.6% of total
net assets, before the deduction of Preferred Stock. (For a more complete
explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 2 of this report
to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

Relative to the broader municipal market, we maintained a neutral level of
interest rate risk but are positioned for the continued flattening of the
yield curve. Having reduced some of our more volatile corporate-backed bonds,
the Fund has a more neutral exposure to high yield spread product. With higher
interest rates and our outlook for slower economic activity, however, we will
be on the lookout for opportunities to slightly increase the Fund's duration.

A Discussion With Your Funds' Portfolio Managers (concluded)


Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


Describe conditions in the State of New York.

The State of New York maintains credit ratings of A1, AA and AA- from Moody's,
Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch, respectively. Moody's assigns a positive
outlook to the state's rating, while Fitch and S&P carry stable outlooks. The
state economy continues to improve and revenue collections are increasing.
State tax collections remain largely dependent on the performance of the
financial sector, but tax receipts for fiscal year 2005 (ended March 31, 2005)
were 15% above the prior fiscal year. Due to surging tax collections,
particularly income taxes, the fiscal year 2005 operating surplus totaled
$1.2 billion.

For the first time in more than 20 years, New York lawmakers approved a budget
on time. The fiscal year 2006 budget calls for $105 billion in spending and
forecasts a 5% increase in tax receipts for the fiscal year (which began April
1, 2005). Aided by this revenue growth, the enacted budget includes most of
the governor's original proposals for closing an estimated $4 billion deficit.
However, this does not factor in a lawsuit won by the Campaign for Fiscal
Equity that could add up to $2 billion in annual state education spending.
Crafting balanced budgets beyond fiscal year 2006 will present a challenge
given political resistance to additional tax hikes and cuts in popular
programs, as well as pressure from local governments for pension and Medicaid
relief, and new education spending.

Current employment numbers show a 1% increase from year-ago levels. New York
ranks fifth-highest among all states in per capita income. Modest income
growth through the remainder of 2005 would boost personal income tax receipts,
which account for roughly 38% of general fund receipts.


How did the Fund perform during the period?

For the six-month period ended November 30, 2005, the Common Stock of Muni New
York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 4.90% and
5.56%, based on a period-end per share net asset value of $14.66 and a per
share market price of $12.92, respectively, and $.360 per share income
dividends. Over the same period, the total investment return on the Fund's
Common Stock was +.02%, based on a change in per share net asset value from
$15.05 to $14.66, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, lagged the +.86% average
return of the Lipper New York Municipal Debt Funds category for the six-month
period. (Funds in this Lipper category limit their investment to securities
exempt from taxation in New York or a city in New York.) Notably, the Lipper
category consists primarily of funds with the ability to invest in municipal
issues with longer durations, whereas our portfolio is limited to bonds in the
intermediate duration range. This put the Fund at a disadvantage relative to
the Lipper average as the yield curve continued to flatten, causing shorter-
duration and intermediate-duration bonds to underperform longer-dated
municipal investments.

In addition, airline-related debt, which had benefited Fund performance in the
prior period, detracted from returns over the past six months. We continue to
hold a core position in airline-related debt issues, as they are a significant
contributor to the yield of the portfolio, although we are monitoring our
exposure carefully given the inherent volatility in this sector. Also
hindering performance was our exposure to Puerto Rico paper, which we had
increased during the period. Although these bonds underperformed the broader
market over the past six months due to budgetary concerns in Puerto Rico, they
continue to offer both good liquidity and positive incremental yield
characteristics. For these reasons, coupled with our expectation for a
positive resolution to the budgetary concerns, we would view further weakness
in Puerto Rico as a buying opportunity.

We continued to capitalize on the flattening yield curve by moving into longer-
dated securities as opportunities presented themselves, while remaining within
our intermediate investment parameters. This strategy helped the Fund's total
return as the price of longer-dated bonds increased.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights
section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value.
As a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock may vary significantly from total investment returns
based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.



SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS                                           NOVEMBER 30, 2005



What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

We entered the period defensively positioned and moved toward neutral as the
period progressed. Most activity in the portfolio occurred in the latter part
of the six-month period as rates increased all along the yield curve. This
provided an opportunity to restructure a portion of the portfolio as more
attractively structured, higher-yielding alternatives became available. In
general, our strategy was to roll out of shorter, more seasoned holdings
(generally in the five-year - 10-year range) into longer-dated bonds
(generally in the 25-year range) that we believe could contribute more
attractive yield and total return potential.

As detailed in the Fund's prospectus, 80% of the bonds we hold in the
portfolio must have a duration between three years and 10 years. Because the
yield curve measures maturity, not duration, we are able to add bonds with
longer maturities without necessarily extending duration. This is accomplished
through the purchase of cushion bonds, which have longer maturities but are
priced and traded at their relatively short call date (generally 10 years or
less). We believe this strategy will benefit Fund performance if the yield
curve continues to flatten, as expected, and should allow the Fund to
more closely match the maturity profile of its Lipper peers. Overall, the
portfolio's average maturity was extended by a little more than a year, for
an average maturity just shy of 14 years at period-end.

For the six months ended November 30, 2005, the average yield for the Fund's
Auction Market Preferred Stock (AMPS) was 2.23%. The Fed's interest rate hikes
clearly are having an impact on the Fund's borrowing costs. The Fed raised the
short-term interest rate target 100 basis points during the six-month period
(and once more on December 13). Still, the tax-exempt yield curve remained
relatively steep and continued to generate an income benefit to the holders of
Common Stock from the leveraging of Preferred Stock. However, should the
spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of
leveraging will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's
Common Stock. At the end of the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due to
AMPS, was 33.45% of total net assets, before the deduction of Preferred Stock.
(For a more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see
page 2 of this report to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We ended the period with a fairly neutral market outlook. At its most recent
meeting, the Fed modified its language slightly, removing the long-standing
reference to monetary policy that it deems "accommodative." This represented
the first hint that the measured monetary tightening campaign may be nearing
an end. Until it does, we anticipate continued volatility as investors adjust
their assumptions about the markets.

Against this backdrop, we will continue to take advantage of the volatility
and higher rates in an effort to generate a competitive yield for our
shareholders. One benefit of the recent upturn in long-term interest rates is
that it has allowed us to restructure the portfolio in terms of coupon, call
date and maturity without having a negative impact on yield, and in certain
cases, with a favorable impact on yield. Over time, we believe this
restructuring should translate into enhanced total return performance.

Swap Agreements


The Funds may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts
in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in
market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for
periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in
market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the
party with whom each Fund has entered into the swap will default on its
obligation to pay the Funds and the risk that the Funds will not be able to
meet their obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.

SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS                                           NOVEMBER 30, 2005



Notes to Financial Statements


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and Muni New York Intermediate Duration
Fund, Inc. (the "Funds" or individually as the "Fund") are registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end
management investment companies. The Funds' financial statements are prepared
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may
require the use of management accruals and estimates. Actual results may
differ from these estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all
adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a
fair statement of the results for the interim period. All such adjustments are
of a normal, recurring nature. The Funds determine and make available for
publication the net asset values of their Common Stock on a daily basis. Each
Fund's Common Stock shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol MUI for Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and MNE for Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.

(a) Valuation of investments--Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the over-
the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price in
the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Funds under the general
direction of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are
reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Funds. Financial
futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are
valued at their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options
written or purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-
traded options. In the case of options traded in the OTC market, valuation
is the last asked price (options written) or the last bid price (options
purchased). Swap agreements are valued by quoted fair values received daily by
the Fund's pricing service. Short-term investments with a remaining maturity
of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value, under which method the investment is valued at cost and any premium or
discount is amortized on a straight line basis to maturity. Investments in
open-end investment companies are valued at their net asset value each business
day. Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Funds.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--Each Fund may engage in various
portfolio investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to
hedge, or protect, their exposure to interest rate movements and movements in
the securities markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the
contract or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract.

* Financial futures contracts--Each Fund may purchase or sell financial
futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts are
contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date and at
a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund deposits
and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on
which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees
to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known as
variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and
the value at the time it was closed.

* Options--Each Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is
reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability
is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from)
the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the
extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the
cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Forward interest rate swaps--Each Fund may enter into forward interest rate
swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty agree to
make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract amount, commencing
on a specified future effective date, unless terminated earlier. When the
agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount
equal to the value of the agreement.

(c) Income taxes--It is each Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds amortize all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(f) Offering costs--Direct expenses relating to the public offering of each
Fund's Preferred Stock were charged to capital at the time of issuance of the
shares.


2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services,
Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Inc. ("ML & Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of each Fund's portfolio and provides
the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services
necessary to the operations of the Funds. For such services, each Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .55% of the Fund's average daily net assets,
including proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock. FAM has contractually
agreed to waive a portion of its fee during the first seven years of each
Fund's operations ending July 31, 2010, as follows:


                                                             Fee Waiver

                                                            Net Assets)

Years 1 through 5                                                  .15%
Year 6                                                             .10%
Year 7                                                             .05%
Year 8 and thereafter                                              .00%


FAM has not agreed to waive any portion of its fee beyond July 31, 2010.

For the six months ended November 30, 2005, FAM earned fees and waived a
portion of its fees as follows:

                                          Investment

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement


Activities of and Composition of the Board of Directors

All but one member of each Fund's Board of Directors is an independent
director whose only affiliation with Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
"Investment Adviser") or other Merrill Lynch affiliates is as a director of
each Fund and as a trustee or director of certain other funds advised by the
Investment Adviser or its affiliates. The Chairmen of the Boards are also
independent directors. New director nominees are chosen as nominees by a
Nominating Committee consisting of independent directors. All independent
directors also are members of each Board's Audit Committee and the independent
directors meet in executive session at each in-person Board meeting. The Board
and the Audit Committee meet in person for at least two days each quarter and
conduct other in-person and telephone meetings throughout the year, some of
which are formal board meetings, and some of which are informational meetings.
The independent counsel to the independent directors attends all in-person
Board and Audit Committee meetings and other meetings at the independent
directors' request.


Investment Advisory Agreements--Matters Considered by the Board

Every year, each Board considers approval of each Fund's investment advisory
agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). Each Board assesses the
nature, scope and quality of the services provided to each Fund by the
personnel of the Investment Adviser and its affiliates, including
administrative services, shareholder services, oversight of fund accounting,
marketing services and assistance in meeting legal and regulatory
requirements. Each Board also receives and assesses information regarding
the services provided to the Fund by certain unaffiliated service providers.

At various times throughout the year, each Board also considers a range of
information in connection with its oversight of the services provided by the
Investment Adviser and its affiliates. Among the matters considered are:
(a) fees (in addition to management fees) paid to the Investment Adviser and
its affiliates by each Fund; (b) Fund operating expenses paid to third
parties; (c) the resources devoted to and compliance reports relating to each
Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions, and its compliance
with its Code of Ethics and the Investment Adviser's compliance policies and
procedures; and (d) the nature, cost and character of non-investment
management services provided by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates.

Each Board believes that the Investment Adviser is one of the most experienced
global asset management firms and considers the overall services provided by
the Investment Adviser to be of high quality. Each Board also believes that
the Investment Adviser is financially sound and well managed and notes that
the Investment Adviser is affiliated with one of America's largest financial
firms. Each Board works closely with the Investment Adviser in overseeing the
Investment Adviser's efforts to achieve good performance. As part of this
effort, each Board discusses portfolio manager effectiveness and, when
performance is not satisfactory, discusses with the Investment Adviser taking
steps such as changing investment personnel.


Annual Consideration of Approvals by the Board of Directors

In the period prior to the Board meeting to consider renewal of the Investment
Advisory Agreement, each Board requests and receives materials specifically
relating to the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement. These materials are
prepared separately for each Fund, and include (a) information compiled by
Lipper Inc. ("Lipper") on the fees and expenses and the investment performance
of the Fund as compared to a comparable group of funds as classified by
Lipper; (b) information comparing the Fund's market price with its net asset
value per share; (c) a discussion by the Fund's portfolio management team of
investment strategies used by the Fund during its most recent fiscal year; (d)
information on the profitability to the Investment Adviser and its affiliates
of the Investment Advisory Agreement and other relationships with the Fund;
and (e) information provided by the Investment Adviser concerning services
related to the valuation and pricing of Fund portfolio holdings, allocation of
Fund brokerage fees, the Fund's portfolio turnover statistics, and direct and
indirect benefits to the Investment Adviser and its affiliates from their
relationship with the Fund.


Certain Specific Renewal Data

In connection with the most recent renewal of each Fund's Investment Advisory
Agreement in November 2005, the independent directors' and Board's review
included the following:

Investment Adviser's Services and Fund Performance--Each Board reviewed the
nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Adviser,
including the investment advisory services and the resulting performance of
each Fund. The Boards focused primarily on the Investment Adviser's investment
advisory services and each Fund's investment performance, having concluded
that the other services provided to each Fund by the Investment Adviser were
satisfactory. Each Board compared Fund performance - both including and
excluding the effects of each Fund's fees and expenses - to the performance of
a comparable group of mutual funds, and the performance of a relevant index or
combination of indexes. While each Board reviews performance data quarterly,
consistent with the Investment Adviser's investment goals, each Board attaches
primary importance to performance over relatively long periods of time,
typically three to five years. For a fund in operation for less than three
years, such as each of the Funds, the Board considers performance for the life
of the fund.



SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS                                           NOVEMBER 30, 2005



The Board noted that for the period ended August 31, 2005, Muni Intermediate
Duration Fund, Inc.'s performance was in the second quintile for the one-year
period. The Board reviewed the Fund's investment objectives and strategies.
The Board discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser
responsible for investment operations and the senior management of the
Investment Adviser's municipal investing group the strategies being used to
achieve the stated objectives. Among other things, the Board considered the
size, education and experience of the Investment Adviser's investment staff,
its use of technology, and the Investment Adviser's approach to training and
retaining portfolio managers and other research, advisory and management
personnel. The Board also reviewed the Investment Adviser's compensation
policies and practices with respect to the Fund's portfolio manager. The Board
also considered the experience of the Fund's portfolio manager and noted that
Mr. DiMella has over ten years of experience investing in municipal
securities. The Board concluded that the Fund's performance supported the
continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement.

The Board noted that Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.'s
performance was in the fifth quintile for the one-year period ended August 31,
2005. In considering this measure of relative performance, the Board took into
account the fact that the universe of comparable funds was very small. The
Board reviewed the Fund's investment objectives and strategies. The Board
discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser responsible for
investment operations and the senior management of the Investment Adviser's
municipal investing group the strategies being used to achieve the stated
objectives. Among other things, the Board considered the size, education and
experience of the Investment Adviser's investment staff, its use of
technology, and the Investment Adviser's approach to training and retaining
portfolio managers and other research, advisory and management personnel. The
Board also reviewed the Investment Adviser's compensation policies and
practices with respect to the Funds' portfolio manager. The Board also
considered the experience of the Funds' portfolio manager and noted that Mr.
Browse has over five years of experience investing in municipal securities.
The Board concluded that the Fund's performance supported the continuation of
the Investment Advisory Agreement.

Management Fees and Other Expenses--Each Board reviews the Fund's contractual
management fee rate and actual management fee rate as a percentage of total
assets at common asset levels - the actual rate includes advisory and
administrative service fees and the effects of any fee waivers - compared to
the other funds in its Lipper category. It also compares the Fund's total
expenses to those of other comparable funds. The Investment Adviser noted that
it did not have clients other than investment companies with similar
investment mandates. With respect to Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. the
Board noted that the contractual and actual management fee rates, as well as
total expenses, were lower than the median fees charged by comparable funds,
as determined by Lipper. With respect to Muni New York Intermediate Duration
Fund, Inc. the Board noted that contractual and actual management fee rates,
as well as total expenses, were equal to the median fees charged by comparable
funds, as determined by Lipper. Each Board concluded that the Fund's
management fee and fee rate and overall expense ratio are reasonable compared
to those of other comparable funds.

Profitability--Each Board considers the cost of the services provided to the
Fund by the Investment Adviser, and the Investment Adviser's and its
affiliates' profits relating to the management and distribution of the Fund
and the MLIM/FAM-advised funds. As part of its analysis, each Board reviewed
the Investment Adviser's methodology in allocating its costs to the management
of the Fund and concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the
allocation. The Boards also considered federal court decisions discussing an
investment adviser's profitability and profitability levels considered to be
reasonable in those decisions. Each Board believes the Investment Adviser's
profits are reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of services
provided.

Economies of Scale--Each Board considered the extent to which economies of
scale might be realized as the assets of a Fund increase and whether there
should be changes in the management fee rate or structure in order to enable
the Fund to participate in these economies of scale. Each Board considered
economies of scale to the extent applicable to each Fund's closed-end
structure and determined that each Fund appropriately benefits from any
economies of scale and no changes were currently necessary.


Conclusion

After the independent directors deliberated in executive session, each entire
Board, including all of the independent directors, approved the renewal of the
existing Investment Advisory Agreement, concluding that the advisory fee was
reasonable in relation to the services provided and that a contract renewal
was in the best interests of the shareholders.
