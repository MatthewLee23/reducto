             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members and Board of Directors of
     UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of portfolio
investments,  as of December 31, 2007, and the related  statements of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended,  the  statements  of changes in members'
capital for each of the two years in the period then  ended,  and the  financial
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements
and financial  highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and the disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments in investment funds as of December 31, 2007, by correspondence  with
management of the underlying  investment  funds and others.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UBS M2
Fund,  L.L.C.  at December 31, 2007,  the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members'  capital for each of
the two years in the period the ended, and the financial  highlights for each of
the indicated periods,  in conformity with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.


                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1.  ORGANIZATION

     UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the  "Fund") was  organized  as a limited  liability
     company  under  the  laws of  Delaware  on  August  13,  2001.  The Fund is
     registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
     Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The
     Fund's investment  objective is to seek capital  appreciation over the long
     term. The Fund is a multi-manager  fund that seeks to achieve its objective
     by deploying  its assets  among a select  group of  portfolio  managers who
     primarily employ  long/short equity  strategies,  including those involving
     foreign  issuers.   Generally,   such  portfolio   managers  conduct  their
     investment programs through  unregistered  investment funds  (collectively,
     the "Investment  Funds"),  in which the Fund invests as a limited  partner,
     member or  shareholder  along  with  other  investors.  The Fund  commenced
     operations on February 1, 2003.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser"  and, when
     providing    services    under   the    Administration    Agreement,    the
     "Administrator"),   a  Delaware  limited  liability  company,   to  provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Adviser is a direct  wholly owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Adviser may  determine  and are  generally
     accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
     interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and  exclusive  discretion.  Members  can only  transfer  or  assign  their
     membership interests,  or portion thereof, (i) by operation of law pursuant
     to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency or dissolution of a Member,  or (ii)
     with the written approval of the Directors,  which may be withheld in their
     sole and absolute discretion.

 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     a. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Adviser  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the
     terms and  conditions of the respective  operating  agreements and offering
     memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are



                                                                               6

                                                             UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     a. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     carried at fair value as  determined by the Fund's pro rata interest in the
     net  assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations  utilize  financial
     information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and
     performance  incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds'
     managers  or  pursuant  to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The Fund's
     valuation   procedures   require  the  Adviser  to  consider  all  relevant
     information  available  at the time  the Fund  values  its  portfolio.  The
     Adviser  and/or the Directors will consider such  information  and consider
     whether it is appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value
     such a position  at its net asset  value as  reported  or whether to adjust
     such  value.  The  underlying  investments  of  each  Investment  Fund  are
     accounted  for at  fair  value  as  described  in  each  Investment  Fund's
     financial statements (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

     Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in the
     form of  cash or  securities,  are  first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
     investment's cost.

     b. INCOME RECOGNITION

     Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses
     from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are  calculated  on the cost recovery
     basis.

     c. FUND COSTS

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; interest expense; certain
     organization  costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;
     expenses of meetings of Directors  and  Members;  all costs with respect to
     communications  to Members;  and other  types of  expenses  approved by the
     Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.

     d. INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has reclassified  $17,568,253 and $42,782,177 from accumulated net
     investment  loss  and  accumulated  net  realized  gain  from  investments,
     respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year ended December
     31, 2007.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an  adjustment to net
     contributions,  the  amount  of  taxable  income  or loss  that  have  been
     allocated to the Fund's Members and had no effect on the net assets.

     In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
     Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes."
     This  standard  defines  the  threshold  for  recognizing  the  benefits of
     tax-return positions in the financial statements as  "more-likely-than-not"
     to



                                                                               7

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     d. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

     be sustained by the taxing  authority  and  requires  measurement  of a tax
     position meeting the more-likely-than-not  criterion,  based on the largest
     benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized.  Management has
     analyzed the Funds' tax positions  taken on federal  income tax returns for
     all open tax years (tax years ended  December 31, 2003 - 2006) for purposes
     of implementing  FIN 48, and has concluded that no provision for income tax
     is  required  in the  funds'  financial  statements.  The  Fund  recognizes
     interest and penalties,  if any,  related to  unrecognized  tax benefits as
     income tax expense in the Statement of Operations.  During the period,  the
     fund did not incur any interest or penalties.

     Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     e. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  that pays money market  rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest, which is included in interest receivable on the Statement
     of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     f. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

     From  time to time  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
     connection  with  such  transactions  it is  the  Fund's  policy  that  its
     Custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the fair
     value of which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase  transaction,
     including accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the
     fair value of the collateral declines, realization of the collateral by the
     Fund may be delayed  or  limited.  As of  December  31,  2007 there were no
     outstanding repurchase agreements.

     g. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
     and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that the estimates utilized in
     preparing  the Fund's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
     however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

 3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides  investment  advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
     an Investment Manager Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement, the Fund pays

 3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     In  consideration  for such  services,  the Fund pays the  Administrator  a
     monthly  fee (the  "Administrator  Fee") at an annual  rate of 0.30% of the
     Fund's net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Administrator's and
     the Adviser's  capital account.  The  Administrator  Fee and the Investment
     Management Fee will be paid to the  Administrator  out of the Fund's assets
     and debited  against the Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding net assets
     attributable to the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's capital account.  A
     portion of the Investment  Management Fee and the Administrator Fee is paid
     by UBSFA to its  affiliates.  UBS Financial  Services Inc.  ("UBS FSI"),  a
     wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement agent
     for the Fund, without special compensation from the Fund, and will bear its
     own costs  associated  with its  activities as placement  agent.  Placement
     fees, if any, charged on contributions are debited against the contribution
     amounts to arrive at a net subscription  amount. The placement fee does not
     constitute assets of the Fund.

     The net increase (or decrease) in Members'  capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of all Members on
     a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than  the  Investment  Management  Fee  and the
     Administrator  Fee which are similarly  allocated to all Members other than
     the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee
     for each meeting attended. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all
     reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed  by the Fund
     related to Directors  for the year ended  December  31, 2007 were  $37,032,
     which is included in other expense.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

 4.  ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (an  affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as the custodian
     (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial services for
     the Fund.

     PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate  of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Accounting  and
     Investor  Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides certain
     administrative,   accounting,   record  keeping,  tax  and  Member  related
     services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee  primarily  based upon (i) the
     average net assets of the Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii)
     the  aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
     sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or its affiliates. Additionally,
     the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

 5.  LOAN PAYABLE

     Effective  July 1, 2007 the Fund,  along  with other UBS  sponsored  funds,
     entered into a $200,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
     with Bank of Montreal - Chicago Branch, which is the Illinois branch of the
     parent  to Harris  Trust  and  Savings  Bank.  Under  the most  restrictive
     arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount  that  combined  with the other
     borrowings of the Fund would not of the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5.  LOAN PAYABLE (CONTINUED)

     Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's borrowing capacity
     is also limited to the portion of the unused line of credit at any point in
     time. The Fund is only liable under the line of credit to the extent of its
     own borrowing  there under.  The interest rate on the borrowing is based on
     the  Federal  Funds rate plus 150 basis  points per  annum.  The  committed
     facility  also  requires a fee to be paid by the Fund, on a pro rata basis,
     based on the amount of the aggregate commitment which has not been utilized
     of 25 basis points per annum.  For the year ended  December  31, 2007,  the
     Fund's average interest rate paid on borrowings was 6.35% per annum and the
     average borrowings outstanding were $2,062,409.  The Fund had $1,000,000 in
     borrowings  outstanding at December 31, 2007. Interest expense for the year
     ended  December  31, 2007 was  $130,963,  of which $479 was payable at year
     end.

     On December 21, 2007 and December 27, 2007, the Fund,  along with other UBS
     sponsored  funds,  entered into the ninth amendment and the tenth amendment
     respectively  to  the  existing  credit  agreement.  These  two  amendments
     provided a  temporary  increase  in the credit  line from  $200,000,000  to
     $400,000,000  for the  period  commencing  January  4,  2008,  through  and
     including February 15, 2008.  Commencing February 16, 2008, the credit line
     reverts back to a $200,000,000 total unsecured facility which terminates on
     July 29, 2008.

 6.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     Aggregate  purchases and proceeds  from sales of  Investment  Funds for the
     year ended  December 31, 2007 amounted to  $200,033,207  and  $150,464,824,
     respectively.

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet  received  all such  Schedule
     K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2007.

 7.  INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
     of which were related parties.

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management
     fees of  between  1% and 2.5% (per  annum) of net  assets  and  performance
     incentive  fees or  allocations  ranging  from 16.5% to 25% of net  profits
     earned.  One or more underlying fund  investments  have entered into a side
     pocket arrangement.

 8.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for



                                                                              10

 8.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK (CONTINUED)

     differences,  and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment
     Funds is limited to the value of these investments as reported by the Fund.

 9.  INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience,  management  feels that the likelihood
     of such an event is remote.

10.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards  No.  157  "Fair  Value   Measurements"   ("FAS  157").  FAS  157
     establishes an authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework
     for  measuring  fair  value,  and  requires  additional  disclosures  about
     fair-value measurements.  The application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
     years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim  periods within those
     fiscal years.  Management believes that the application of FAS 157 will not
     have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements.

                         UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

         The Directors (including the Independent  Directors) last evaluated the
Investment Management Agreement at a meeting on November 15, 2007. The Directors
met in an  executive  session  during  which  they were  advised  by and had the
opportunity  to discuss  with  independent  legal  counsel  the  approval of the
Investment Management  Agreement.  The Directors reviewed materials furnished by
the Adviser, including information regarding the Adviser, its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. Tables indicating comparative fee
information,  and  comparative  performance  information,  as well as a  summary
financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and
were reviewed and discussed. The Directors discussed with representatives of the
Adviser the Fund's  operations and the Adviser's ability to provide advisory and
other services to the Fund.

         The Directors reviewed,  among other things, the nature of the advisory
services to be provided to the Fund by the  Adviser,  including  its  investment
process,  and the  experience  of the  investment  advisory and other  personnel
proposing to provide  services to the Fund. The Directors  discussed the ability
of the Adviser to manage the Fund's  investments  in accordance  with the Fund's
stated  investment  objectives  and  policies,  as  well as the  services  to be
provided by the Adviser to the Fund,  including  administrative  and  compliance
services,  oversight  of Fund  accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in
meeting legal and regulatory  requirements and other services  necessary for the
operation of the Fund. The Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of
highly skilled investment  professionals,  research analysts and administrative,
legal and  compliance  staff  members to ensure  that a high level of quality in
compliance  and  administrative  services  would be  provided  to the Fund.  The
Directors also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources
available to the Adviser and the Adviser's affiliates,  including UBS AG and UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial").  Accordingly, the Directors felt that
the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was  appropriate,  and
that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

         The Directors  reviewed the  performance  of the Fund and compared that
performance to the performance of other  investment  companies  presented by UBS
Financial  which had objectives and strategies  similar to those of the Fund and
which  are  managed  by  other,  third-party  investment  advisers  ("Comparable
Funds").  The Directors  observed  that the Fund's  annualized  performance  was
within  the  range of  performance  of its  Comparable  Funds and only 3/10 of a
percentage  point below the median  performance  of its  Comparable  Funds.  The
Directors  also compared the  volatility  of the Fund to that of its  Comparable
Funds.  The Directors  observed that the Fund's  volatility was slightly  higher
than the median volatility of its Comparable Funds.

          The Directors considered the fees being charged by the Adviser for its
services to the Fund as compared to those charged to the Comparable  Funds,  and
as compared to the fees charged by UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA") and its
affiliates  for other  UBS  alternative  investment  products.  The  information
presented to the Directors  showed that the  management fee being charged to the
Fund was one above the median  management  fee being  charged to its  Comparable
Funds,  although the  Directors  also noted that the Fund was not subject to any
incentive  fee.  The  Directors  also noted that the Fund was not subject to any
incentive  fee. In comparing  the advisory fees being charged to the Fund to the
fees being charged by UBSFA and

<PAGE>

its  affiliates for other UBS  alternative  investment  products,  the Directors
noted  that  although  the  combination  of  management  fee and  administrative
services  fee being  charged  to the Fund was the  highest  being  charged to an
Alternative  Investment  Group  fund-of-funds,  the Fund was not  subject to any
incentive fee. In light of the foregoing, the Directors felt that the management
fee being charged to the Fund was appropriate.

         The Directors also  considered the  profitability  of UBSFA both before
payment to brokers and after payment to brokers and  concluded  that the profits
to be  realized  by  UBSFA  and  its  affiliates  under  the  Fund's  Investment
Management  Agreement  and from other  relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA
were within a range the Directors  considered  reasonable and  appropriate.  The
Directors  also  discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large  enough at that
time to  support  a request  for  breakpoints  due to  economies  of scale.  The
Directors determined that the fees were reasonable. The Directors concluded that
approval of the Investment Management Agreement was in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

    UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. (the "Adviser") votes proxies for each fund (each a
"Fund," collectively, the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as such,
has adopted these  Proxy-Voting  Policies and  Procedures  (these  "Policies and
Procedures"). The Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in unregistered
investment  vehicles  ("Investment  Funds") which have investors  other than the
Fund.  Generally,  each of the  Funds may  invest a  majority  of its  assets in
non-voting securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do not
submit matters to investors for vote; however,  should a matter be submitted for
vote and provided the Fund holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund, the
Adviser  will vote  proxies in what it views to be in the best  interest  of the
Fund  and in  accordance  with  these  Policies  and  Procedures.  The  Board of
Directors  (the "Board") of the Funds has adopted these  Policies and Procedures
as the Funds'. The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

    Proxy-voting  is an integral  part of the  Adviser's  investment  management
process.  The Adviser is under a fiduciary  duty to act in the best  interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize  shareholder  value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the  Adviser's  part to  analyze  the  issues  connected  with the  votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

    Generally  speaking,  where the Adviser  holds voting  rights,  it will vote
consistent  with  management's  recommendations  on  routine  matters,  absent a
particular  reason  to the  contrary.  Non-routine  matters  will be  voted on a
case-by-case  basis taking into  consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.
<PAGE>

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

    Any  circumstance  or  relationship   which  would  compromise  a  portfolio
manager's  objectivity  in voting  proxies in the best  interest  of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest.  In such  situations,  the Adviser will
address any material  conflicts  before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy,  the Adviser will presume the  existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

    o    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment Fund
         soliciting  proxies or has  communicated  its view to the Adviser on an
         impending proxy vote;

    o    The portfolio  manager  responsible for  proxy-voting  has identified a
         personal  interest in the Investment Fund soliciting  proxies or in the
         outcome of a shareholder vote;

    o    Members of the  portfolio  management  team,  including  the  portfolio
         manager   responsible  for  proxy-voting,   and/or  members  of  senior
         management,   have  a  personal  interest  through  investment  in  the
         Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

    o    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
         outcome of a shareholder  vote have  attempted to influence  either the
         Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

    Employees of the Adviser  should be aware of the  potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser,  from employees'  personal
relationships or special  circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business.  Employees who become aware of any such  conflicts of
interest  are  under  obligation  to bring  them to the  attention  of the Chief
Compliance  Officer  or Legal who will work with  appropriate  personnel  of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

    ADDRESSING  MATERIAL  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  A conflict of interest will be
considered  material to the extent it is  determined  that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

    If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the Adviser
may vote proxies  notwithstanding  the  existence of the  conflict.  The Adviser
shall  maintain a written  record of all conflicts of interest  identified,  the
materiality determination,  and the method used to resolve the material conflict
of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate  personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution  before  voting  proxies  affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

    o    Disclosing  the conflict and  obtaining  consent  before  voting (which
         consent  in the case of the  Fund(s)  may be  obtained  from the Fund's
         board of directors);

    o    Engaging  another  party on behalf of the  Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
         its behalf;

    o    Engaging a third party to  recommend  a vote with  respect to the proxy
         based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

    o    Such  other  method as is deemed  appropriate  under the  circumstances
         given the nature of the conflict.
<PAGE>

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

    The Adviser  will file an annual  report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

    Where the Funds hold voting  rights,  the Funds shall  include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified  Shareholder  Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge,  upon request by taking the specified  action;  and
(iii) a statement  that  information  regarding  how the Adviser  voted  proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period,  is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription  document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting  rights,  the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

    The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting in
an easily  accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the end
of the fiscal  year  during  which the last entry was made on such  record,  the
first two years on-site:

    o    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

    o    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

    o    A copy of each proxy  solicitation  (including  proxy  statements)  and
         related materials with regard to each vote;

    o    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
         conflicts of interest;

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                               UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

The Fund is managed by a portfolio  management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day  management of the Fund's portfolio.  Norman E. Sienko,  Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio  management team, is primarily  responsible for the
selection  of  the  Fund's  investments,  and is  jointly  responsible  for  the
allocation  of the Fund's  assets among  Investment  Funds.  Russell  Sinder and
Joseph M.  Sciortino,  the other members of the portfolio  management  team, are
jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's investments.

Mr.  Sienko has served as a Portfolio  Manager of the Fund since its  inception,
and as head of the Adviser's  portfolio  management group since 1998. He is also
currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio  Manager of the Fund since 2007. Mr. Sinder has been  associated  with
the  Adviser  since  1998 and is also an  Executive  Director  of UBS  Financial
Services.  Mr.  Sciortino  joined the  portfolio  management  team in 2007.  Mr.
Sciortino has been associated with the Adviser since 2006 and is also a Director
of UBS  Financial  Services.  Previously,  he served as Senior  Analyst  at Lake
Partners, Inc. from April 2001 though August 2006.

The  Fund's  Portfolio  Managers  manage  multiple  accounts  for  the  Adviser,
including  registered  closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

Potential  conflicts of interest may arise  because of the  Portfolio  Managers'
management of the Fund and other  accounts.  For example,  conflicts of interest
may arise with the  allocation  of  investment  transactions  and  allocation of
limited  investment  opportunities.   Allocations  of  investment  opportunities
generally  could raise a  potential  conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio  Managers  may have an  incentive  to  allocate  investments  that are
expected to increase in value to  preferred  accounts.  Conversely,  a Portfolio
Manager  could favor one account  over  another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem  investments  are placed.  The Portfolio  Managers may be
perceived  to have a conflict of  interest if there are a large  number of other
accounts,  in  addition  to the Fund,  that they are  managing  on behalf of the
Adviser.  In  addition,  each  Portfolio  Manager  could be  viewed  as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more  Portfolio  Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio  Managers'  overall  responsibilities  to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives,  strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons,  the Portfolio  Managers may
purchase  different  investments  for the Fund and the other  accounts,  and the
performance of investments  purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the  investments  purchased for other  accounts.  The Portfolio  Managers may
place  transactions  on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary  to  investment  decisions  made for the  Fund,  which  could  have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential  conflict of interest  may be  perceived  if the Adviser  receives a
performance-based  advisory  fee as to one  account but not  another,  because a
Portfolio  Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the  performance  of  that  account  directly  determines  the  Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment  services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade  allocation  policies  and  procedures,  that it believes  address the
conflicts  associated with managing multiple  accounts for multiple clients.  In
addition,  the Adviser
<PAGE>

monitors  a  variety  of  areas,  including  compliance  with  Fund  guidelines.
Furthermore,  senior investment and business personnel at UBS Financial Services
periodically review the performance of the Portfolio Managers.

The Portfolio  Managers'  compensation is comprised  primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary  bonus paid by UBS Financial  Services or its affiliates and
not by the Fund. A portion of the  discretionary  bonus may be paid in shares of
stock or stock  options of UBS AG, the ultimate  parent  company of the Adviser,
subject  to  certain  vesting  periods.  The  amount  of a  Portfolio  Manager's
discretionary  bonus,  and the portion to be paid in shares or stock  options of
UBS AG, is determined by senior officers of UBS Financial Services.  In general,
the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which
is necessarily  weighted more than any other factor.  These factors may include:
the overall performance of UBS Financial Services and its Alternative Investment
Group;  the overall  performance of UBS AG; the  profitability  to UBS Financial
Services  derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed
by the Alternative  Investment  Group; the absolute  performance of the Fund and
such other  accounts for the  preceding  year;  contributions  by the  Portfolio
Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative Investment Group; participation
by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel;  and support by the Portfolio
Manager  generally to colleagues.  The bonus is not based on a precise  formula,
benchmark or other metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts  advised by the
Fund's  Portfolio  Managers and  approximate  assets under  management  in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.

                   AND SECTION 906 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

I, Douglas  Lindgren,  Principal  Executive  Officer of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the
"Registrant"), certify that:

         1.     The Form N-CSR of the Registrant  (the "Report")  fully complies
