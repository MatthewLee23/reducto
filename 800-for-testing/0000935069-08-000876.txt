                Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of
arbitrage strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund includes allocations to event arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage
managers. Event arbitrage managers seek to identify mispricings in securities
that will be resolved through an anticipated event. Events can include mergers,
acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations and bankruptcy (either entering into
bankruptcy or emerging from it). Skills required include the ability to analyze
the relative value of the securities involved and the probability of the event
taking place in a timely manner. Fixed income arbitrage managers seek to
identify discrepancies in the prices of securities that are very closely related
and arbitrage that discrepancy.

For the year ended January 31, 2008, the Fund had a total return of -1.76%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2008, the Fund had an average annual total return of 6.48%.

While nearly all our arbitrage managers had positive returns, the fund's
performance for the year was adversely impacted by a manager whose capital
structure arbitrage positions fell victim to the dramatic widening of spreads
between senior secured loans and high yield bonds over the summer and was forced
to sell its portfolio at a substantial loss.

Merger arbitrage, which began the year strongly, has seen heightened volatility
recently as several high profile deals involving financial buyers failed to
close. Even in cases where a deal is proceeding as planned, spreads have widened
as investors question whether leveraged buyout bidders might suffer buyers'
remorse and attempt to back out. While the strategy produced positive returns
for the period, the credit market disruption had a large impact, and the outlook
for merger arbitrage has dimmed. Furthermore, the volume of deals has abated
significantly with the leveraged buyout market all but shut down.

Within the fixed income arbitrage strategy, the recent market turmoil has been a
welcome development. Specifically, opportunities to trade abnormalities
presented by G7 yield curves increased considerably during the fourth quarter as
heightened volatility in worldwide markets caused fixed income rates to shift,
and fear in the financial sector caused swap spreads to widen. Nonetheless, as
we enter 2008, managers must proceed cautiously as systemic deleveraging can
distort historic relationships, at least temporarily.

Our Asian-focused convertible manager saw healthy returns for the period as high
realized volatility and healthy new issuance provided an attractive environment
for generating returns. We expect this heightened level of volatility to persist
in 2008 and are optimistic on returns for this strategy.

            Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund")
allocates its assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety
of distressed investment strategies while seeking to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes.

The Fund allocates to investment managers that buy the securities (generally
bonds and bank loans) of companies that are in bankruptcy or in danger of
bankruptcy. These managers are able to buy these securities at a discount to
their eventual value because traditional fixed income portfolio managers who
bought the bonds or banks that made the loans may not want, or be able, to own
them once they are in default. The sellers may also not have the expertise and
patience to go through a lengthy restructuring process. Distressed investing
involves credit analysis, legal expertise and (often) negotiating ability, as
the portfolio manager must (i) estimate the value of the claims to be acquired,
(ii) evaluate the likely timing, and resolution, of the bankruptcy process and
(iii) reach agreements with other claimants in order to speed the process.

For the year ended January 31, 2008, the Fund had a total return of 4.32%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2008, the Fund had an average annual total return of 11.61%.

As a whole, the past year was mediocre for the distressed strategy as widening
spreads and a dearth of new activity impeded returns. Most managers continued to
harvest legacy positions while conservatively approaching new investments.
Several of the managers' remaining reorganizations suffered setbacks during the
second half of the year as negotiations between stake holders took longer than
anticipated and the market for new financing tightened considerably. These
adverse developments resulted in lower expected recoveries for creditors,
driving the price of the debt down.

Although the global corporate default rate has remained at the lowest sustained
level in over two decades, the writing is clearly on the wall. With many
companies facing reduced credit availability and deteriorating fundamentals, we
anticipate new distressed opportunities will materialize towards the latter half
of 2008. Our managers are well positioned to take advantage of these
opportunities as many have significant dry powder ready to deploy.

                  Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
long-biased portfolios of stocks, usually based on bottom-up equity research.
These portfolios generally vary from 20% to 40% net long.

For the year ended January 31, 2008, the Fund had a total return of 7.04%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2008, the Fund had an average annual total return of 8.07%.

The past year saw the implosion of the U.S. mortgage lending bubble and the
specter of recession grow substantially. After declining -6.1% in January, the
S&P return for the last twelve months was -4.1%, with consumer discretionary and
financials sectors the biggest losers. The period also saw the reversal of
several trends for the equity markets. In particular, growth stocks outperformed
value stocks for the first time since before the bursting of the technology
bubble. In addition, the period was also the first in some time when large cap
stocks outperformed small caps.

The Long/Short Fund did a good job of preserving capital even as the broader
equity markets wilted. Much as the markets saw increased volatility this year,
so too did our managers. Dispersion between our managers was very high, with a
few managers generating returns north of 30% for the period. While shorting
(financials, in particular) received much publicity in 2007, opportunities on
the long side were still abundant. In fact, our managers with exceptional
performance generally realized a majority of their returns from their long
portfolios.

On the short side, the housing/subprime theme was a large driver of returns as
many managers were one step ahead of the broader markets in understanding how
problems in housing would impact other companies, including many in the consumer
discretionary and financials sectors. We remain optimistic on the prospects for
shorting, as many shaky, speculative companies outside of the housing/finance
sector were given a pass last year despite their deteriorating fundamentals. We
suspect that the coming year will not be as kind to these companies as weakness
in the economy exposes flawed business models and excessive valuations.

                Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
capital among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market
neutral strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

For the year ended January 31, 2008, the Fund had a total return of 3.11%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2008, the Fund had an average annual total return of 2.90%.

The Fund contains managers that attempt to create long and short portfolios that
are roughly equal in size and therefore immune to overall stock markets
movements. These strategies may be quantitative in nature, using computer
screens to pick long and short portfolios of stocks and balancing their risk
exposure through optimization techniques.

Performance was disappointing and suffered notably from one quantitative market
neutral manager that experienced poor returns. These poor returns were driven in
large part by the contagion within the equity market neutral strategy witnessed
in August and also in November, when a similar but smaller scale version of the
prior contagion occurred. We have spent substantial time analyzing what happened
to this manager's strategies during these contagion periods as well as their
other strategies and have decided to redeem our investment.

Fortunately, this negative performance by one manager was more than offset by
positive performance from the other managers in this fund. In particular, our
manager with a large tactical bet long companies with stable earnings and low
leverage and short their inverse performed well for the period, up over 20%. The
systematic underperformance of high quality companies with stable earnings and
low leverage over the past five years is emblematic of the tremendous risk
seeking behavior that was the norm for this period. We believe that the pendulum
has just begun to swing back the other way and are very optimistic about the
prospects for this manager's strategy in the coming quarters.

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of opportunistic
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
smaller-sized, more idiosyncratic portfolios employing directional strategies or
focusing on particular markets or sectors.

For the year ended January 31, 2008, the Fund had a total return of 7.24%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on May 27, 2005
through January 31, 2008, the Fund had an average annual total return of 5.43%.

Our Opportunities Fund generated reasonable returns during the period despite
turmoil in the capital markets as its diversified mix of underlying managers and
strategies complemented one another.

The Fund's tactical short credit bet generated significant gains as credit
spreads widened substantially during the period. In addition, the Fund's
investment in a niche strategy focused on handicapping drug trial outcomes saw
outsized returns. Other significant contributors included one of our
Asia-focused long/short managers and our relative value bet between "high" and
"low" quality stocks.

As mentioned in last year's letter, we had been frustrated by the initial
returns for the Fund and have spent considerable time re-optimizing the
underlying mix of managers. During the last year, we trimmed a few positions and
initiated new investments with managers whom we thought were talented stock
pickers. Although we may continue to make changes to the fund going forward, we
believe that the Fund is better positioned than it was a year ago.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Managers and Members of the Aetos Capital Funds:

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations, changes
in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC, and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Fund, LLC (hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at January 31, 2008, the
results of each of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended, and
the changes in each of their members' capital for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for the periods presented, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Funds' management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of the underlying portfolios funds at
January 31, 2008, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by
Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed
Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC,
Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC and Aetos Capital
Opportunities Fund, LLC valued at $536,259,329 (93.4% of the Fund's members'
capital), $151,547,464 (90.0% of the Fund's members' capital), $932,836,479
(89.4% of the Fund's members' capital), $74,361,272 (56.0% of the Fund's
members' capital), and $146,506,648 (78.4% of the Fund's members' capital)
respectively, at January 31, 2008, the values of which have been estimated by
the Investment Manager, under general supervision of the Board of Managers, in
the absence of readily ascertainable market values. Those estimated values may
differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
market for the investments existed, and the difference could be material.

1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC and
the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (collectively the "Funds" and
individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of Delaware as limited liability
companies. The Funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
companies. Each of the Funds is a fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital
appreciation by allocating their assets among a select group of private
investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds) ("Portfolio Funds") that
utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies specific for each Fund to
produce an attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent
of the various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes. Aetos
Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of January 31,
2008 the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 70%, 67%, 71%, 74% and 79% for the Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Cayman Fund and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Cayman Fund, respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market neutral
strategies.


                                                                              24

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current


                                                                              25

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

market exchange and the differences could be material to the financial
statements. The use of different factors or estimation methodologies could have
a significant effect on the estimated fair value.

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant. Such
withholdings are listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in
Members' Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts
to which they apply.

E.  Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.


                                                                              26


<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

F.  Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2008.

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.


                                                                              27


<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual retainer of $32,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $3,250 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee receives an additional annual
retainer of $1,900. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques that may
involve significant risks. Such risks include those related to the volatility of
the equity, credit and currency markets, the use of leverage associated with
certain fixed income strategies, derivative contracts and in connection with
short positions, the potential illiquidity of certain instruments, and
counterparty and broker arrangements. These Portfolio Funds may invest a high
percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to achieve
a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be
more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory developments in a
particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may experience
increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The Funds invest
in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may result in
additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.


                                                                              28


<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK (CONTINUED)

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

</TABLE>

7. INVESTMENTS

As of January 31, 2008, collectively the Funds had investments in forty-nine
Portfolio Funds, none of which were related parties. The following table lists
the Funds' investments in Portfolio Funds as of January 31, 2008. The agreements
related to investments in Portfolio Funds provide for compensation to the
general partners/managers in the form of management fees of 1.0% to 2.0% (per
annum) of the net assets and incentive fees or allocations of 10% to 20% of net
profits earned. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with
lock-up provisions ranging from 3 months to 3 years from initial investment. The
liquidity provisions shown in the table apply after any applicable lock-up
provisions.


                                                                              29

9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Funds adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation
No. 48 "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB
STATEMENT NO. 109" ("FIN 48"), as required, on February 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires
the Investment Manager to determine whether a tax position of a Fund is more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing
authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized
is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement which could result in the Fund
recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. FIN 48 must be applied
to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption and the cumulative effect,
if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to net assets as of February 1, 2007.

Based on its analysis, the Investment Manager has determined that the adoption
of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Funds' financial statements.
However, the Investment Manager's conclusions regarding FIN 48 may be subject to
review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not
limited to, further implementation guidance expected from the FASB, and on-going
analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 157, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS." This standard establishes a single
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by
existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting
principles from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures
about fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Funds' financial statement
disclosures.


                                                                              33

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                       AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC
                               PROXY VOTING POLICY

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This policy sets forth Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("AAM")
         policies and procedures for voting proxies with respect to portfolio
         securities held in the accounts for which AAM provides discretionary
         investment management services and for which AAM has the explicit
         authority to vote their proxies. The policy will be reviewed and, if
         necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised proxy voting
         issues as they arise.

         As an investment manager for various clients, including clients
         governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
         amended ("ERISA"), AAM may vote proxies as part of its authority to
         manage, acquire and dispose of client account assets, unless the "named
         fiduciary" for an ERISA account has explicitly reserved the authority
         for itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the


<PAGE>

         client investment management agreement does not provide that AAM will
         vote proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, AAM will make
         voting decisions solely in the best interests of its clients and its
         ERISA plan clients and beneficiaries and participants, considering all
         relevant factors and without undue influence from individuals or groups
         who may have an economic interest in the outcome of a proxy vote. In
         fulfilling its obligations to its clients, AAM will act in a manner it
         deems prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the
         economic value of the underlying portfolio securities held in its
         clients' accounts.

II.      ROUTINE CORPORATE MATTERS

         AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management
         on matters which are common management-sponsored initiatives, provided
         that, in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives will not detract
         from the economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
         accounts. These matters are set out below:

         (i)      Appointment or election of auditors;
         (ii)     Routine elections or re-elections of directors;
         (iii)    Director's liability and indemnification;
         (iv)     General updating/corrective amendments to charter;
         (v)      Name changes;
         (vi)     Elimination of cumulative voting; and
         (vii)    Elimination of preemptive rights.

III.     ISSUES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT

         A.       AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of
                  management initiatives which may have a substantive financial
                  or best interest impact, provided that, in AAM's opinion,
                  approval of such initiatives will not detract from the
                  economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
                  accounts. These matters are set out below:

                  (i)      Capitalization changes which eliminate other classes
                           of stock and voting rights;
                  (ii)     Changes in capitalization authorization for stock
                           splits, stock dividends, and other specified needs
                           which are no more than 50% of the existing
                           authorization;
                  (iii)    Stock purchase plans with an exercise price of not
                           less than 85% of fair market value;
                  (iv)     Stock option plans that are incentive based and not
                           excessive;
                  (v)      Other stock-based plans which are appropriately
                           structured;
                  (vi)     Reductions in supermajority vote requirements; and
                  (vii)    Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions.

         B.       AAM will generally not vote in support of management on
                  certain issues which have a potential substantive financial or
                  best interest impact when AAM believes that approval of the
                  proposal may negatively impact the economic value of the
                  company's securities held in AAM client accounts. These
                  matters are set out below:

                  (i)      Capitalization changes which add classes of stock
                           which are blank check in nature or that dilute the
                           voting interests of existing shareholders;
                  (ii)     Changes in capitalization authorization where
                           management does not offer an appropriate rationale
                           or that are contrary to the best interest of
                           existing shareholders;
                  (iii)    Anti-takeover and related provisions which serve to
                           prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                           their rights or effectively deter appropriate tender
                           offers and other offers;
                  (iv)     Amendments to by-laws which would require
                           supermajority shareholder votes to pass or repeal
                           certain provisions;
                  (v)      Classified boards of directors;
                  (vi)     Reincorporation into a state which has more
                           stringent anti-takeover and related provisions;


<PAGE>

                  (vii)    Shareholder rights plans which allow appropriate
                           offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or
                           trigger provisions which prevent legitimate offers
                           from proceeding;
                  (viii)   Excessive compensation or non-salary compensation
                           related proposals;
                  (ix)     Change-in-control provisions in non-salary
                           compensation plans, employment contracts and
                           severance agreements that benefit management and
                           would be costly to shareholders if triggered; and
                  (x)      "Other business as properly comes before the
                           meeting" proposals which give a blank check to those
                           acting as proxy.

IV.      SOCIAL AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES

         AAM, believing that management's job is to handle ordinary business
         matters, and not wanting to arbitrarily impose a judgment on such
         matters, usually votes with management on these proposals. Third party
         analyses of these issues are taken into account. If an issue will, in
         our view negatively impact the investment merits of a company, we will
         oppose it.

V.       CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

         Situations may arise where there are material conflicts between AAM's
         interest and those of its advisory clients. AAM may resolve potential
         conflicts by using any of the following methods: (1) adopting a policy
         of disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent
         before voting: (2) basing the proxy vote on pre-determined voting
         guidelines if the application of the guidelines to the matter do not
         involve the exercise of discretion on the part of AAM; or (3) using the
         recommendations of an independent third party.

VI.      PROXY VOTING RECORD RETENTION

         AAM retains the following records: (1) proxy voting policies and
         procedures; (2) proxy statements; (3) records of votes cast on behalf
         of clients; (4) records of clients' requests for proxy voting
         information; and (5) any documents prepared by or on behalf of AAM that
         were material in making decisions on how to vote. AAM retains the
         above-mentioned records for a minimum of five years.

VII.     PROXY ADMINISTRATION

         AAM's internal Proxy Committee (the "Committee") develops the firm's
         positions on all major corporate issues, creates guidelines, and
         oversees the voting process. The Committee, comprised of the Chief
         Investment Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel,
         analyzes types of proposals based on whether they would adversely
         affect shareholder's interests and make a company less attractive to
         own. In evaluating proxy proposals each year, the Committee relies upon
         our own knowledge of each company and its management, independent
         research provided by third parties, and information presented by
         company managements and shareholder groups.

         Once the Committee establishes its recommendations, they are
         distributed to AAM's Portfolio Management Group as voting guidelines.
         Ultimately, the investment professional primarily accountable for a
         portfolio is responsible for votes on companies in that portfolio. Most
         vote consistent with AAM's guidelines. Occasionally, some will take an
         independent view on certain issues and vote differently. When an
         investment professional casts votes which are counter to the
         Committee's guidelines, they are required to document their reasons in
         writing for the Committee. Annually, the Board of Managers of the AAM
         Funds will review AAM's proxy voting process, policies, and voting
         records.

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Investment Manager manages multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition to the Funds, these other accounts may include separate accounts,
collective trusts, or offshore funds. The Investment Manager manages potential
conflicts between funds or with other types of accounts through allocation
policies and procedures, internal review processes, and oversight by directors
and independent third parties. The Investment Manager has developed trade
allocation procedures and controls to ensure that no one client, regardless of
type, is intentionally favored at the expense of another. Allocation policies
are designed to address potential conflicts in situations where two or more
funds or accounts participate in investment decisions involving the same
securities.

promotions and/or equity participation in the firm. Officers are also eligible
to share in the net profits of the business under a profit participation plan.
Participation amounts are determined on the basis of performance and

<TEXT>
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR COVERED OFFICERS OF
       INVESTMENT COMPANIES ADVISED BY AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC

The Board of Managers of each registered investment company listed on Schedule A
hereto (each a "Fund" and  collectively,  the "Funds") has adopted the following
Code of Ethics (the "Code") applicable to its President and Treasurer  ("Covered
Officers") of Funds advised by Aetos Alternatives  Management,  LLC ("Aetos") to
ensure the continuing  integrity of financial  reporting and  transactions.  The
Covered Officers covered by the Code are listed on Schedule B hereto.

I.   SEPARATE CODE

This Code is the sole  code of ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for  purposes  of
Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002.  Insofar  as any other code of
ethics previously adopted by Aetos sets forth the fundamental principles and key
policies  and  procedures  that govern the  conduct of all of Aetos'  employees,
including the Covered Officers,  such prior code of ethics is superceded by this
Code to the extent that such principles,  policies and procedures  conflict with
the  provisions  of this Code.  The Funds' and Aetos' codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the  "Investment  Company Act")
are separate  requirements  applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this  Code.  In  addition  to this Code or any other  code of ethics
previously  adopted by Aetos,  the  Investment  Company  Act and the  Investment
Advisers  Act of 1940 (the  "Advisers  Act") and  rules  promulgated  thereunder
contain many specific provisions designed to protect the Funds from conflicts of
interest and overreaching.  Any conduct by Covered Officers required by specific
Investment  Company Act or Advisers Act  provisions  or the rules  thereunder is
presumed to be in compliance with this Code. Each Covered Officer is accountable
for his or her adherence to this Code and Aetos' policies. Any violation of this
Code by a Covered Officer may result in disciplinary action, including immediate
dismissal.

II.  REQUIREMENTS

All Covered Officers must:

     1.   Engage in and  promote  honest  and  ethical  conduct,  including  the
          ethical  handling of actual or apparent  conflicts of interest between
          personal and professional relationships;

     2.   Act  responsibly  in producing  and  produce,  full,  fair,  accurate,
          timely,  and  understandable  disclosure in reports and documents that
          the Funds  file  with,  or submit  to,  the  Securities  and  Exchange
          Commission (the "SEC") and in other public  communications made by the
          Funds;

     3.   Comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;

     4.   Promptly report suspected material violations of this Code,  including
          violations of  securities  laws or other laws,  rules and  regulations
          applicable  to the  Funds,  to Aetos'  General  Counsel  and the Audit
          Committee; and

     5.   Promote accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer must act with integrity,  including being honest and candid
while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law
or Aetos'  policies,  and place the  interests  of the Funds  before the Covered
Officer's own personal interests.


<PAGE>


Each Covered  Officer is required to  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
requirements applicable to each Fund and must not knowingly misrepresent or fail
to disclose, or cause others to misrepresent or fail to disclose, material facts
about a Fund to others,  including,  but not limited to, officers and counsel to
Aetos and the Funds,  and their  respective  independent  managers,  independent
auditors and governmental regulators. Each Covered Officer should, to the extent
appropriate within his area of  responsibility,  consult with other officers and
employees  of the  Funds  and  Aetos  with the  goal of  promoting  full,  fair,
accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public  communications  made
by the Funds.

It is the  responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the
standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

III. AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS

The  overarching  principle  of this Code is that the  personal  interests  of a
Covered  Officer  should not be placed  improperly  before the  interests of the
Funds. As a result, each Covered Officer must: (i) handle any actual or apparent
conflict  of  interest in an ethical  manner;  (ii) not use his or her  personal
influence  or  personal  relationships  to  influence  investment  decisions  or
financial  reporting  by a  Fund  whereby  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
personally  (directly or  indirectly)  to the  detriment of the Fund;  (iii) not
cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the personal benefit of
the  Covered  Officer  rather  than the  benefit of such Fund;  and (iv) not use
material non-public knowledge pertaining to a Fund.

IV.  COMPLIANCE AND ANNUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Each Fund will follow  certain  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing this
Code,  including,  but not limited to, the  following:  (i) all  violations  and
potential  violations will be reported to the General Counsel of Aetos; (ii) the
General  Counsel of Aetos will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
potential  violations;  (iii) if the General Counsel of Aetos  determines that a
violation  has occurred,  he or she will take all  appropriate  disciplinary  or
preventive  action and inform  the Board of  Managers  of the Fund of his or her
decision;  and (iv) all  changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent
required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR or otherwise as provided by SEC rules.

Each  Covered  Officer is required:  (i) upon  receipt of the Code,  to sign and
submit to the  General  Counsel  an  acknowledgment  stating  that he or she has
received,  read and understands  the Code; (ii) annually  thereafter to submit a
statement to the General Counsel  confirming  that he or she has received,  read
and  understands  the Code and has complied with the  requirements  of the Code;
(iii) not to retaliate  against any employee  subordinate to the Covered Officer
for reports of  potential  violations  that are made in good faith;  and (iv) to
notify the General  Counsel of Aetos,  as  appropriate,  if the Covered  Officer
observes any irregularities or violations of this Code.

V.   AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

Except with  respect to  Schedules  A and B hereto,  which may be updated at any
time,  this Code may be amended  only by the Board of Managers of each Fund at a
meeting of the Board of  Managers  duly  called for that  purpose.  Waivers,  as
defined  in Form  N-CSR,  from  this  Code may be  granted  only by the Board of
Managers of each affected Fund at a meeting of the Board of Managers duly called
for that purpose.
