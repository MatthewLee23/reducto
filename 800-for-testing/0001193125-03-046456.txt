Dear Shareholder:

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value increased 4.13% for the three
months ended June 30, 2003, including the $0.142 in reinvested distributions.
Consistent with our policy of seeking to minimize risks, while earning
reasonable returns, the Fund's average overall exposure for the quarter was
approximately 69%.

   For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Fund's net asset value gained
4.11%, including $0.286 in reinvested distributions. Our average overall
exposure for the first half was 66%.

   The Fund recently announced a distribution of $0.048 payable on July 25,
2003 to shareholders of record on July 11, 2003. This amount was consistent
with the Fund's historic policy of distributing 10% of net asset value per
year. The net value of a distribution depends on the exact net value at the
time of declaration. For the July distribution 0.83% of the Fund's net asset
value was equivalent to $0.048 per share. Including this distribution, the
Fund's total payout since inception is now $12.370.

   As announced on July 28, 2003, the Fund, which had been paying an annual 10%
fixed distribution based on net asset value, will move to a variable
distribution, to be phased in by the end of the year. The variable distribution
will be calculated based on earnings and distribution requirements under the
Internal Revenue Code.

   The 10% payout policy was adopted during a very different economic climate
and is now considered to be no longer appropriate in light of current
conditions in the capital markets and economy. In past years, a significant
portion of the 10% payout was not investment income, but instead a return of
capital. These returns reduced shareholders investment in the fund and in
future periods may be subject to additional taxation.

   As you know, we installed a new portfolio management team on April 1, and
they are focused on strengthening performance and earning the continued
commitment of our shareholders. The change in management and new payout policy
are intended to serve your best interests by seeking to grow and preserve your
investment over the long term.

   The fund's objective to seek the highest total return, consisting of capital
appreciation and current income, consistent with the preservation of capital
remains unchanged. For more information about the Zweig Total Return Fund,

              Sincerely,
              /s/ Philip R. McLoughlin

              Chairman

                                 MARKET OUTLOOK

   Our bond exposure on June 30, 2003 was 49% with average duration (a measure
of sensitivity to interest rate changes) of 4.6 years. On March 31, 2003, our
bond exposure was 47% with average duration of 5.5 years. If we were fully
invested, we would be at 62.5% in bonds and 37.5% in stocks. Consequently, at
49% we are at about 78% of a full position (49% divided by 62.5%).

   U.S. Treasury bond prices continued to rally during the second quarter, for
a return of 3.5% on the 10-year Treasury note. For the first half of the year,
10-year Treasury notes returned 4.6%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note
ended the quarter at 3.51%, having fallen nearly 30 basis points from 3.8%. The
Federal Reserve cut the

<PAGE>

Federal Funds rate by another 25 basis points on June 25, bringing the
overnight rate to 1.00%. In taking this action, Fed officials said they were
still concerned about "deflationary pressures" in the economy. They left open
the possibility of another rate cut, saying the economy has "yet to exhibit
sustainable growth." However, bond prices did not respond well to the
quarter-point interest rate cut because many investors were hoping for, or even
counting on, a half-point reduction.

   For the quarter, and for the entire first half of the year, we kept the
duration fairly high, looking for the bond market rally to continue. The Fund
benefited from the exposure to the bond market. However, as bond prices seemed
to reach relatively expensive levels from a risk/reward perspective, we trimmed
the exposure somewhat.

   Despite the Fed's concern about the sluggish economy, the late June sell-off
in the Treasury market indicated that investors were positioning themselves for
a recovery. As a result, while we remain committed to some exposure to the
Treasury bond market, we began a process of trimming risk by reducing our
holdings.

   Our equity exposure at the close of the second quarter was 21%, unchanged
from the March 31 figure. At 21% we are at about 56% of a full position (21%
divided by 37.5%).

   Stocks made a strong showing in the second quarter. The rally lifted the Dow
Jones Industrial Average 12% for the quarter and 8.8% for the first half. The
S&P 500 Index gained 15% for the quarter and 11.8% for the six months while the
Nasdaq Composite climbed 21% for the quarter and 21.5% for the half.

   Stocks began to rally just before we invaded Iraq. When the war went well,
the market picked up steam. It was as if investors no longer had to worry about
the war. Also, there was a reasonable amount of pessimism on a short-term basis
around March. That helped to strengthen the market. While I don't see it as a
huge factor, the tax cuts may have played a role in this development, as well.
With dividends so miniscule to begin with, I don't see where the lower rate
will benefit people all that much in the short run. The capital gains tax went
down some and, on the margin, it was a plus.

   Another reason for the market rise was the very large drop in short-term
interest rates. Suddenly, people began looking at their money market funds
yielding 1% or less and decided to put some money in the stock market. I don't
think it was the smartest thing they could have done, but they were doing it.
There was a huge move into junk bonds. By chasing the yield, they increased
their risk--a much higher yield than a money market fund, but a completely
different ball game. Also, there was a big move into investment grade bonds,
corporate bonds, and government bonds. All of these factor combined to help
give the market a lift.

   However I don't think the rally is sustainable. Why did interest rates go
down? Why did the Federal Reserve Board recently cut again by a quarter-point
to 1.00%, the lowest level since 1958? Rates are low because the economy is in
trouble and the Fed can't seem to fix it. It did not reduce rates thirteen
times since early 2001 because things were so great. The Fed actions have
helped on the margin, but they don't solve the economy's major problems.

   First, there is the excess capacity and the lack of capital spending. Lower
rates won't change that. Second, there are the cheap labor costs in China,
Mexico, India, and elsewhere, squeezing profit margins and threatening us with
deflation. The rate cuts won't change that. Third, there is the excess debt
still in the economy. The lower rates do help those who are in debt, especially
homeowners who can refinance. But, it's terrible for savers who are seeing the
interest rates go way down on their bonds or money funds. They have less money
to spend.

                                      2

   Mortgage rates are based on government bonds and not on the short-term
rates. Interestingly, when the fed cut by one-quarter point in June, the bond
market reacted and yields rose steeply in a little over three weeks. If they
continue in this direction, I believe it will put the kibosh on refinancing of
home mortgages. So far, the last cut in short-term rates has hurt the bond
market.

   It is important for me to clarify that I can no longer trust the Fed as a
market indicator. Going back to 1913, every time the Fed cut three consecutive
times (which I believed was a pretty aggressive Tactic) and allowed the money
supply to grow, the market was up eighteen months later by approximately 34%.
This time, the market was significantly down--about 22%/1/. Previously, the Fed
never failed as a market predictor. This time it not only failed, it failed
utterly. The bubble may have worked its way so deeply through the economy that
lowering rates isn't enough to revive the economy.

   I don't think we are anywhere near to washing out the bubble. The bubble got
going in 1996 and lasted for about four years. I think we have seen elements of
the revival of the bubble lately among tech stocks. In some cases, the
price-to-earnings ratios are outrageous. I don't see earnings to justify the
boom. Again, speculation is rampant. In my view, we have seen a rally in a
massive bear market.

   Previous bear markets have seen many advances as steep as the current one.
Since the late 1920s, there were 36 bear rallies greater than 10%. We have had
18 bear rallies of at least 17% and six bear rallies of at least 25%.
Incidentally, in the bear market that began in 2000, we have already had four
prior rallies that averaged about 20%/1/. I still don't believe that last
October's lows were the final lows of this bear market.

   Some people are placing high hopes in the administration's huge tax cut
package as a strong stimulus to the economy and the stock market. As I
mentioned earlier, the dividend tax cut doesn't do much for me because
dividends are so low to begin with. I do think it will push companies to
increase their dividend payments. The question is, where's the money coming
from? If earnings aren't so great, it will be tough for companies to raise
dividends.

   You could argue that people will retain more in after-tax dividends and
spend the money, boosting the economy. The lower capital gains tax might help
the market somewhat. To my mind, a broad cut in income tax rates would have
been a better market stimulus. Overall, the tax package will help on the
margin, but I don't know if it's enough to turn the economy around.

   There are those who may think that the current weak dollar is beneficial to
our economy and hence the stock market. Well, we have tested the dollar to
death as a stock market indicator and have not been able to find a stable
relationship. As we've seen in the last few months, the market sometimes does
better with a weak dollar. Sometimes it does poorly. It gets us to the question
as to why the dollar is weak. One reason is that the economy is not doing as
well as it should. Also, the dollar may be overvalued against other currencies.
We have a poor interest rate differential now against Europe and that may be
hurting the dollar. The weak dollar does help our exports, but one wonders how
long foreigners will continue to hold our stocks and bonds if they think the
dollar will continue to drop. Of course, the weak dollar does make investments
here cheaper for foreigners. But, if they expected the dollar to keep
declining, why would they buy?

   At this time, stocks are definitely not cheap. The ratio of the S&P 500
stocks to earnings over the past twelve months has recently hit around 32,
nearly double the historical range. Their overvaluation is another reason why I
don't think we have hit a bottom. Even a number like 16,

                                      3

<PAGE>

which is average, doesn't do it for me. If you research the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and go back to the bottom of most major markets for the last
130 years, you would count some 13 horrendous bear markets. The average
price-to-earnings ratios at those bottoms were around 8. It gets complicated
when you start computing operating earnings and forward earnings. But, in my
opinion it doesn't look like we are near the price-to-earnings ratio you should
expect at market bottoms.

   In the second quarter, the market got a big lift when, following three
quarters of net withdrawals, the net inflow of funds into domestic stock mutual
funds increased by over $32 billion. If such inflows are moderately positive,
that's fine and it's bullish. But, if they get excessive, it's apt to mean
there's too much speculation. For the moment, I think the inflow is probably a
positive, but I'm concerned that too much money may be going into speculative
funds. While there were fairly heavy redemptions in the funds last summer, I
don't think they approached the levels we'll find at the eventual bottom.
Percentage-wise, they weren't as high as we saw after the crash of 1987.

   Meanwhile, cash levels at mutual funds are down to about 4 or 5%, their most
fully invested position in the past two years. That is a telling indicator for
me. The average cash/assets level at funds is approximately 9.2% and we have
seen much higher levels. To put the current figure in perspective, recall that
we have had the greatest speculative bubble in the 200-year history of the
stock market. How can we wash out such a bubble and wind up with so low a
cash/assets ratio? I believe it shows that there is just too much optimism out
there and it is another indication that the market hasn't seen its lows.

   In addition, I have some concern that margin debt grew by nearly 8% from
March and is now at its highest level since 2002. Roughly half of the margin
debt had been eliminated from the peak of early 2000. Since the level seemed to
have been close to infinity, cutting it by half didn't do the trick. The level
never got low enough in relation to gross domestic product, a gauge I like to
use. Now, the quick comeback in recent months doesn't appear to be legitimate
to me.

   A plus for the market is that the number of initial public offerings (IPOs)
remains on the light side. There were only five IPOs in the second quarter,
raising $1.58 billion against 39 IPOs, raising $6.7 billion in the second
quarter of last year. Recently, we have seen a few more offerings, but the
environment remains hostile for offerings. It's hard to bring out non-earning
tech stocks as we saw three years ago and I think that is good as I believe it
keeps the supply low.

   Wall Street is also more sober when it comes to mergers and acquisitions.
Although there was a spurt in July, the second quarter was the third
consecutive quarter in which mergers and acquisitions fell below $100 billion.
It came to $91.1 billion compared with $106.4 billion in the second quarter of
last year. Typically, at market bottoms, you notice a big reduction in merger
activity and new issues, pointing to the kind of pessimism I believe you want
to see. I don't really know if that activity has gotten low enough.

   A not-so-favorable market sign is that corporate insiders are selling at
their highest levels since back in the 1980s. In the 32 years of data that I
have, there were only three times that the percentage of sales has been higher
than in the last few weeks. I think insiders tend to be right more often than
not. Sometimes, as happened in 1982, insiders sold too soon, coming off the
bottom. But, I take the current heavy insider sales as a negative. Why are they
dumping all this stock while the public is buying hand-over-fist?

   Also, I don't like the fact that investment advisers are currently 60%
bullish and only 16% bearish. The bearish figure is the lowest since before the
crash of 1987. More than 70% of stock market newsletter advisers are
bullish/1/. No matter what kind of pessimism we had when the

                                      4

<PAGE>


rally started a few months ago, sentiment has turned into ridiculous optimism.
I feel that is not good for the market.

   In summary, the first negative for the market is the excessive optimism.
Sentiment was not nearly pessimistic enough at the bottoms last fall or earlier
this year. Second, I think valuations are way too high. Third, while the
economy is limping along on the upside, I don't expect a recovery huge enough
to bail out the stock market. On the positive side, the Fed cut again and the
tax cut package could be helpful. I have a hard time finding other significant
positives.

   Consequently, I am very cautious at this writing. We have cut our exposure
down to 55%, which means 45% cash. If conditions warrant, I may want to cut
back further and raise our cash position.

                             PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

   In accordance with our investment policy guidelines, all of our bonds are
U.S. Government and Agency obligations. As mentioned earlier, our portfolio's
average duration was 4.6 years on June 30. This compares with 5.5 years on
March 31. Since these bonds are highly liquid, they provide the flexibility to
respond quickly to market conditions.

   At the end of the second quarter, our leading equity industry groups
included financials, health care, technology, consumer discretionary, and
energy. The only changes from our March 31 listing were the differences in
ranking between financials and health care and the replacement of consumer
staples by consumer discretionary. During the quarter, we added to our
positions in financials and consumer discretionary and trimmed our holdings in
consumer staples and energy.

   Our leading individual positions include Pfizer, Citigroup, Wells Fargo,
General Electric, Bank of America, Amgen, Dell, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble,
and Occidental Petroleum. New to the above listing are Amgen, Procter & Gamble,
and Occidental Petroleum. No longer in this top category are IBM and Johnson &
Johnson, where we reduced our holdings, and Pharma Holders, which we sold out.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                 June 30, 2003
                                  (Unaudited)

NOTE 1 -- Organization

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988.

NOTE 2 -- Significant Accounting Policies

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  A. Portfolio Valuation

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price. Other over-the-counter
securities are valued at the most recently quoted bid price provided by the
principal market makers. Portfolio securities which are traded both in the
over-the-counter market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the
broadest and most representative market, as determined by the Adviser. Debt
securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by an independent
pricing service, when such prices are believed by the Adviser to reflect the
fair market value of such securities. Short-term investments having a remaining
maturity of 60 days or less when purchased are valued at amortized cost (which
approximates market value). Futures contracts traded on commodities exchanges
are valued at their closing settlement price on such exchange. Securities for
which market quotations are not readily available, (of which there were none at
June 30, 2003) and other assets, if any, are valued at fair value as determined
under procedures approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

  B. Options

   The Fund may purchase options contracts for the purpose of hedging against
changes in the market value of the underlying securities or foreign currencies.

   Options purchased by The Fund are included in the Funds' Schedule of
Investments and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of
the option. When a purchased option is exercised, the cost of the security is
adjusted by the amount of premium paid. The risk associated with purchased
options is limited to the premium paid. The Fund will realize a gain or loss
upon the expiration or closing of the option transaction.

                                      14

<PAGE>



  C. Security Transactions and Investment Income

   Security transactions are recorded on trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. Discount and premium on securities purchased other than short-term
securities are accreted on the constant yield method over the life of the
respective securities. Prior to January 1, 2001, premium on securities was not
amortized.

   Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the
identified cost basis for financial reporting and tax purposes.

  D. Federal Income Tax Information

   It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code ("the Code"), applicable to regulated investment companies, and to
distribute all of its taxable income to its shareholders. In addition, the Fund
intends to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid the imposition of any
excise tax under Section 4982 of the Code. Therefore, no provision for federal
income taxes or excise taxes has been made.

  E. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders

   Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income
and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with tax
regulations that may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences include the treatment of premium amortization, losses
deferred due to wash sales, differing treatment of certain income and gain
transactions, and the timing of distributions. For financial reporting
purposes, book basis capital accounts are adjusted to reflect the tax character
of permanent book/tax differences. The reclassifications have no impact on the
net assets or net asset value of the Fund.

   The Fund has $46,558,126 of capital loss carryovers expiring in 2010 which
may be used to offset future capital gains. The Fund may not realize the
benefits of these losses to the extent it does not realize gains on investments
prior to the expiration of the capital loss carryovers. In addition, under
certain conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of these losses to the extent
that distributions to shareholders exceed required distribution amounts as
defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders may also pay additional
taxes on these excess distributions.

NOTE 3 -- Portfolio Transactions

   During the six months ended June 30, 2003, purchases and sales transactions,
excluding short-term investments were:

  *** Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
      on the opening of the first business day and a sale on the closing of the
      last business day of each period reported. Dividends and distributions,
      if any, are assumed for the purposes of this calculation, to be
      reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and
      Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total investment return based on net asset
      value will be higher than total investment return based on market value
      in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
      the premium of the market value to the net assets from the beginning to
      the end of such years. Conversely, total investment return based on net
      asset value will be lower than total investment
