ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

SUMMARY OF GENERAL INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FUND

The Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified,  actively-managed
Closed-End Fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol "CEE". The
Fund seeks long term capital appreciation primarily through investment in equity
and equity-linked  securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe and Russia.
It is managed and advised by  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of the  Deutsche  Bank
Group.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

Prices for the Fund's shares are published  daily in the New York Stock Exchange
Composite  Transactions section of newspapers.  Net asset value and market price
information  are  published  each Monday in THE WALL STREET  JOURNAL and THE NEW
YORK TIMES, and each Saturday in BARRON'S and other newspapers in a table called
"Closed End Funds". Daily information on the Fund's net asset value is available
from NASDAQ (symbol XCEEX). It is also available by calling:  1-800-437-6269 (in
the U.S.) or 617-443-6918  (outside of the U.S.). In addition, a schedule of the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THERE ARE THREE  CLOSED-END  FUNDS  INVESTING IN EUROPEAN  EQUITIES  MANAGED  BY
WHOLLY-OWNED  SUBSIDIARIES  OF  THE DEUTSCHE  BANK  GROUP:

o    The Germany  Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily  in equities of major German
     corporations.  It may also invest up to 20% in  equities  of other  Western
     European companies (with no more than 15% in any single country).

o    The New Germany Fund, Inc.--investing primarily in the middle market German
     companies and up to 20% elsewhere in Western  Europe (with no more than 10%
     in any single country).

o    The Central  Europe and Russia Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in Central
     European and Russian companies.

Please consult your broker for advice on any of the above or call  1-800-GERMANY
(in the U.S.) or 617-443-6918 (outside of the U.S.) for shareholder reports.

These  funds  are  not  diversified  and  focus  their  investments  in  certain
geographical regions,  thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments,  such as currency  fluctuation,  political
and economic  changes,  and market risks. This may result in greater share price
volatility.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                    May 20, 2005
Dear Shareholders,
   In 2005,  financial  markets have continued to focus on commodity  prices and
slowing global  growth.  Western  Europe  already  revised low growth  forecasts
downward,  blaming oil prices for depressing  gross domestic  product (GDP).  US
markets were  constrained by waning consumer  confidence and slowing GDP growth,
but the US central bank insisted oil prices were not having an adverse impact on
the economy and pushed  ahead with  systematic  increases  in the federal  funds
rate.  Emerging markets  performed well and continued to see robust growth,  but
rising U.S.  interest rates have dampened  investor appetite for emerging market
risk as spreads over developed markets tighten.
   Against  these  trends,  the Central  Europe and Russia Fund  performed  well
during the period again,  outperforming its benchmark. (A custom blend of 45% in
Central  Europe  (CECE-Index),  45% Russia  (RTX-Index)  and 10% in Turkey  (ISE
National 30))1.  For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the Central Europe and
Russia Fund's total return (based on its net asset value per share) was 8.96% in
US dollar  terms,  while its total return  based on share price was 11.31%.  The
fund's benchmark rose 5.43% during the same period.
   In Russia,  the fund benefited  from its exposure to the oil sector.  Lukoil,
our largest  holding in the fund,  outperformed  other oil stocks as well as the
market on the back of good  results and an  improving  production  outlook.  Our
holding in Mechel Steel Group OAO, the largest and most  comprehensive  producer
of specialty  steels and alloys in Russia,  also performed well since its IPO in
November 2004, and contributed positively to the fund's outperformance. In terms
of the broader Russian market, MSCI recently increased Russia's weighting in its
emerging  market indices,  which should  increase demand for Russian stocks.  In
recognition of the growing  importance of non-oil stocks in the Russian  market,
MSCI added several Russian telecom and consumer stocks to the index.
   Contrary to our  expectations,  the Czech and the Hungarian markets continued
their  strong  favorable  performance,  driven by strong  international  capital
inflows,  and supported by good company results.  During the second quarter,  we
have initiated a position in the Hungarian company BorsodChem,  a major chemical
producer as well as the  largest  maker of PVC  plastic in Eastern  Europe.  The
company also contributed positively to the fund's performance.  On April 14, the
company was also added to the CECE Index. The Polish market  underperformed  its
Central  European  peers during the  reporting  period as  increasing  political
uncertainty and unfavorable  exchange rate trends brought a major  correction to
the Polish  market,  and as a consequence  our holdings in Polish midcap stocks,
Echo  Investment  and   Cersanit-Krasnystaw,   negatively  impacted  the  Fund's
performance.
   In the second fiscal quarter, the positive performance  contribution from the
Turkish financial sector continued. The fund benefited again from its overweight
in Finansbank,  which rose 175% during the reporting period,  and its holding in
Yapi ve Kredi  Bankasi.  During the period under  review,  Turkish  markets were
mostly  driven by news  flow on  European  Union  (EU)  accession  talks and the
country's  International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan agreement,  both of which have
helped to spur merger and  acquisition  activity.  Over the next few months,  we
expect Turkish markets to focus on any signs of a delay to the previously agreed
October start date for accession talks.
   The Fund's discount to net asset value averaged 8.6% during the period.
   Sincerely,

   /S/Christian Strenger/S/Julian Sluyters

Index returns assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Fund returns, do not
reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly into an
index.

Investments in funds involve risks including the loss of principal.

This  Fund  is  not  diversified  and  may  focus  its  investments  in  certain
geographical  regions,  thereby  increasing its vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic  changes and market  risks.  This may result in greater share price
volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the fund.  Therefore,  the fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares  will trade at,  below or above net asset  value.  Closed-end
funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.  There is a one-time
public  offering,  and once issued,  shares of closed-end  funds are sold in the
open market through a stock exchange.

The fund will seek to comply  with the  German  tax  transparency  rules for the
fiscal year that ends on October 31, 2005 and therefore qualify as a transparent
fund within the meaning of the German fund tax law (InvStG 2004).

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION: RUSSIA RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EU TO REPAY A PORTION OF
ITS PARIS CLUB DEBT EARLY. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS?

ANSWER:  Russia's  landmark  agreement  to repay $15  billion of its $40 billion
Paris Club  debt--the  largest  ever  early  repayment  of Paris  Club  debt--is
significant for a number of reasons.  First, the Russian government will save $6
billion in interest payments between now and 2020. Second, early repayment sends
a signal to the markets that the government is exercising fiscal responsibility.
Rather than  squander  the windfall it has  received  from high oil prices,  the
government is using monies from its Oil  Stabilization  Fund to  strengthen  its
fiscal position.  The improved credit ratios resulting from Russia's pay-down of
external debt could  ultimately lead to upgrades in sovereign credit ratings and
lower borrowing costs.


QUESTION:  IN HIS  STATE OF THE  NATION  ADDRESS,  PRESIDENT  PUTIN  OUTLINED  A
PROPOSAL FOR LEGISLATION  THAT WOULD LIMIT FOREIGN  OWNERSHIP IN CERTAIN SECTORS
OF THE ECONOMY DEEMED TO BE IMPORTANT TO NATIONAL  SECURITY.  IS THIS A PENDULUM
SWING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION?

ANSWER:  This legislation is not necessarily bad for foreign  investors.  One of
the  greatest  risks in  investing  in  Russia  is the  significant  leeway  the
government has in its  interpretation  of current laws. It might be important to
watch how the legislation develops to see the extent to which foreign investment
is restricted and whether the  legislation  outlines  clear rules.  Well-defined
property  rights  ultimately  mitigate risk to foreign  investors and could help
reduce the possibility of another Yukos-style affair.


QUESTION: THE CE-3 COUNTRIES--POLAND, HUNGARY, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC--HAVE BEEN
MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR A YEAR NOW. ARE THERE ANY TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO
THEIR EU MEMBERSHIP YET?

ANSWER: Since gaining EU membership last year, the CE-3 countries have performed
well, and the governments have continued to move forward on macroeconomic goals.
In particular,  all three countries have achieved progress on inflation targets.
In terms of specific  benefits of EU  membership,  the impact on trade,  foreign
investment  and  infrastructure  development is already  tangible.  Farmers have
reaped the  rewards  of EU trade in  Poland,  for  example,  where  agricultural
exports are up 39% and average  income for  agricultural  workers  increased 73%
last year  (FT/Eurostat,  5/9/05).  Opening borders with Western Europe has also
led  to  increased   foreign  direct   investment  (FDI),  as  global  companies
increasingly  build  manufacturing  and  distribution  centers in the lower-cost
countries  of Central  and Eastern  Europe.  Meanwhile,  commercial  real estate
developers are flocking to the region to capitalize on growing  consumer demand.
The region has also seen  improved  infrastructure,  as CE-3  countries now have
access to EU funds to  upgrade  highways  and  ports.  The  success  of the CE-3
countries  is  ultimately  contingent  on  the  continued  commitment  of  their
governments to implement reforms,  but the benefits of EU membership are already
evident.


QUESTION:  THE TURKISH MARKET HAS RESPONDED  FAVORABLY TO THE  POSSIBILITY OF EU
MEMBERSHIP.  HOWEVER, THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE AMONG CURRENT MEMBER COUNTRIES AS
TO WHETHER  TURKEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EU. IF MEMBERSHIP  TALKS FAIL,  ARE
THE FUNDAMENTALS STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT CURRENT MARKET VALUATIONS?

ANSWER: EU membership certainly carries with it a certain value for the markets,
but it is important to realize that Turkey earned a start date for EU membership
talks by making  progress on economic and political  reforms.  Over the past six
months, the government has demonstrated further commitment to those reforms, and
the  international  community  has  recognized  those  efforts,  as shown by the
dramatic  increase in foreign  investment  in Turkey in the past few months.  We
believe this inflow of funds,  coupled with expected M&A activity in the banking
and telecommunications sectors, is changing the structure of the Turkish market.
Even if talks ultimately  fail, the fiscal and economic  strength that Turkey is
building now could limit the impact of any  potential  political  derailment  of
membership talks.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CZECH REPUBLIC:

The final  quarter of 2004 saw real gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  expand 4.3%
year-over-year  (y-o-y),  which was the best  performance  by the Czech  economy
since 1996.  This result was even more welcome due to the improved  structure of
growth that combined a sharp slowdown of import growth with an  acceleration  of
export growth.  Apart from solid  external  demand,  an inventory  adjustment by
domestic companies was behind the shift in structure of GDP growth. Q1 2005 data
held up  reasonably  well but  reflected  high base effects  associated  with EU
accession  last year.  Industrial  output,  exports and retail  sales all posted
solid gains.  Within the  balance-of-payments  data,  foreign direct  investment
(FDI) remains robust. Due to expected rising private-sector consumption,  strong
investment and export growth we are anticipating that GDP will rise by more than
4% this year. Over the medium term, supply-side reforms (improving  labor-market
flexibility,  promoting new small businesses,  etc.) are needed to maintain this
pace.  The Czech National Bank cut its  repossession  rate three times since the
beginning of the year, to 1.75%.


HUNGARY:

Q4 GDP  growth  edged up to 3.8%  y-o-y,  one tick  higher  than in Q3,  and was
roughly in line with consensus. Overall, GDP rose 4.0% in 2004. Unemployment has
hit a multi-year  high this year,  partly due to seasonal  factors but also as a
result of a slowdown in the  lower-value-added  sectors of the  economy.  We are
basing our  investment  stance on the consumer  price index meeting the National
Bank of Hungary's target both this year and next and remain between 3.5% to 4.0%
for the rest of this year. We see room for 50 to 75 basis points (bps) in easing
before year-end.  The foreign trade deficit  narrowed in Q4 2004:  export growth
picked up to 3.8% quarter over quarter in seasonally  adjusted terms,  following
1.8% in Q3, while import  growth was broadly  flat over Q4.  Fiscal  credibility
remains  weak,  with the deficit at the end of April 2005 standing at 69% of the
full-year target. We expect the official annual goal of 4.7% to be missed,  with
a  deficit  of 5.2% to 5.4% of GDP  more  likely.  Like  most  Central  European
currencies, the forint has weakened over recent months, though to a much smaller
extent.  We believe that the risks are weighted  toward  further  weakness  from
here, given Hungary's ongoing twin-deficits problem.

POLAND:

The Polish  economy in Q4 2004 saw a further  slowing in the pace of  expansion,
with GDP growth slowing to 3.9% year-over-year (y-o-y), from 4.8% in Q3 and 6.1%
in Q2. The paces of exports  and  industrial  production  both cooled from their
above-trend  tracks  during  the  first  half of  2004.  Q1 2005  saw a  further
deceleration in growth,  due to low real-wage  growth and weaker Euroland demand
for Polish exports.  Based on economic stimulus,  we expect GDP to pick up again
in the second half of 2005.  Falling  inflation  (3.0% y-o-y in April,  compared
with 4.4% y-o-y in  December)  should  support  real wage  growth,  while rising
growth in consumer credit should also boost consumer  purchasing  power. We also
expect a pickup in Euroland  growth in the second  half of the year,  supporting
Polish  industrial  production  and  exports.  The  combination  of  the  strong
currency, slower growth and much better-than-expected  inflation performance has
prompted  the  National  Bank of Poland  ("NBP") to cut rates by 100 bps to 5.5%
year-to-date.  With further  currency  appreciation  in sight and risks weighted
toward an undershoot of the inflation  target, we are assuming the NBP is likely
to cut rates by a further 50 bps to year-end.  The current account has surprised
on the upside year to date,  registering  a surplus over the first two months of
EUR195mn,  compared  with a deficit of EUR96mn for the same period in 2003.  The
state budget has also performed  reasonably in the first months of 2005, despite
frontloaded  payments  to the EU.  Overall,  we believe  the  economy is in good
condition,  with  a  sustainable   balance-of-payments  picture.  Fiscal  policy
requires reform,  and we expect the next government to push ahead with this. GDP
growth is forecast at a robust 3.8% for the year as a whole.


RUSSIA:

The Russian economy turned in a strong  performance in 2004,  posting GDP growth
of 7.1%, several notches above expectations even three months ago. The source of
this  surprise  stems from the high raw materials  prices  enjoyed by exporters,
especially  in the second half of 2004.  The Russian  consumer  was also in good
form,  having seen real  incomes  grow nearly 11% that led to a growth in retail
sales of about the same  magnitude.  Economic  growth  during Q1 2005,  from the
evidence in hand,  appeared to maintain itself near 5% y-o-y, though within this
there were important

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

crosscurrents.  On the one side,  the economy was buoyed by the  extremely  high
export selling prices for oil, metals and other natural  resources,  which drove
the "top line" of economic  value.  But this masked other,  more worrying trends
which  will  become  visible  once the  price of oil  moderates.  Fixed  capital
investment is one weak area, and spending  year-over-year  may actually  decline
during the first half of 2005, as the investment climate remains uncertain. Real
personal  income  growth  has also  moderated,  heralding  a likely  slowing  in
domestic  consumption.  Currency  reserves  soared  to  $125  billion  (US $) by
year-end 2004,  pushing Russia into net creditor status for the first time since
communism,  and  paving the way for  another  round of credit  rating  upgrades,
perhaps in mid-2005. Inflation was a disappointment,  though, as cash inflows to
the  economy  and high  real  income  growth  made  price  restraint  difficult.
Authorities  will  struggle  to  bring  price  growth  down to the 10%  level by
year-end,  let alone the earlier 8% target.  But of greater concern currently is
maintaining  GDP growth as both  investment  and export prices slow. A conscious
effort to weaken  the  ruble in order to help  exporters  will also not help the
inflation fight, which may be deferred until 2006.


TURKEY:

After the 9.9% growth seen for 2004 GNP, some moderation is in store, but growth
near 5% looks  plausible for 2005 and 2006,  especially  if ongoing  reforms are
pushed ahead.  In fact,  there is some chance of this target being exceeded this
year, with industrial  output starting  strongly.  For the first three months of
the year, output was up 8.2% y-o-y, reflecting strong growth of both exports and
imports.  In March,  industry grew 5.5%, exports rose 23.5%, and imports were up
20.3%.  However,  the larger  size of  cumulative  imports  meant that the trade
deficit rose 15% y-o-y, to $3.7 billion (US$).  The current account deficit also
rose,  increasing 18% in the first three months to $2.8 billion (US$) due to the
higher  trade  deficit.  FDI flows are  expected to reach a record high level of
$7.8 billion (US$),  which will help allay financing concerns to a great extent.
Total foreign debt at year-end 2004 was $162 billion (US$),  or 54% of GNP, down
from 61% the year before.  We feel this is a major  progress and could support a
credit  rating  upgrade  later in 2005.  Some  aspects of the  economy are doing
extremely well. Among these is tourism,  where the monthly data for March show a
41% rise in visits,  y-o-y.  Another positive trend is inflation,  where CPI has
come in below  consensus  in both  February  and March,  with the latest  figure
falling to 7.9% y-o-y,  versus 8.7% in February.  And though the producer  price
index rose a fuel-induced 1.3% month-over-month in March, taking the annual rate
up to  11.3%,  the CPI is on track to  reach  7% by  year-end.  This has led the
central bank to cut interest rates, currently at 14.5%; the benchmark rate could
see several more cuts during 2005, to as low as 13.5%.


SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The  observations in this letter reflect our own opinions as of May 20, 2005 and
are based on our own analysis,  and others may have different  opinions.  Events
may not transpire as we or they currently  expect.  Also,  while economic events
can influence  broad market  trends,  political,  monetary and other factors are
also relevant to stock performance. In any event, investment results will depend
on our success in identifying  individual  stocks,  which are influenced by many
factors beyond general economic matters. We cannot predict investment results or
whether they will be successful.

THE CENTRAL EUROPE AND RUSSIA FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--APRIL 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  Central  Europe and RUSSIA  FUND,  Inc.  is a  non-diversified,  closed-end
management  investment  company  incorporated  in Maryland.  The Fund  commenced
investment operations on March 6, 1990.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and  liabilities  denominated  in euros and other  foreign  currency  are
translated into United States dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the buying
and selling spot rates quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Purchases
and sales of investment securities, income and expenses are reported at the rate
of  exchange  prevailing  on the  respective  dates  of such  transactions.  The
resultant  gains  and  losses  arising  from  exchange  rate   fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable to  investments,  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts with service providers that contain general  indemnification  clauses.
The Fund's maximum  exposure under these  arrangements  is unknown as this would
involve  future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund  that  have not yet
occurred.  However, based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be
remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code   applicable   to  regulated   investment   companies   and  to  distribute
substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--APRIL 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
        ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
The Fund had a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager").  At its July 12, 2004 Board meeting, the Board approved transferring
the Fund's  management  agreement  with  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  to an
affiliated company,  Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. The transfer,
which became effective September 1, 2004, does not involve any change in control
or actual  management  of the  investment  manager,  which will provide the same
scope of  services,  will  utilize the same people for work on Fund  matters and
will  charge  the same fees  under  the  agreement.  The Fund has an  Investment
Advisory  Agreement  with  Deutsche  Asset  Management  International  GmbH (the
"Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the  Investment  Adviser are affiliated
companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $100  million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $100  million.
The Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides the Investment Adviser with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100  million.  Accordingly,  for the period  ended April 30,  2005,  the fee
pursuant to the Management and Investment  Advisory Agreements was equivalent to
an annual effective rate of .86% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser,  in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objective,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders to select brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf
of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for  the  period  ended  April  30,  2005  were   $49,075,724  and  $50,733,685,
respectively.

The cost of  investments  at April 30, 2005 was  $196,443,835  for United States
Federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly,  as of April 30, 2005, net unrealized
appreciation of investments aggregated  $118,283,416,  of which $121,636,335 and
$3,352,919 related to unrealized appreciation and depreciation, respectively.

For United  States  Federal  income tax  purposes,  the Fund had a capital  loss
carryforward at October 31, 2004 of  approximately  $3,500,000 which will expire
in 2010.

No capital  gains  distribution  is  expected to be paid to  shareholders  until
future net gains have been realized in excess of such carry forward.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED
As of April 30, 2005,  the Fund had no securities on loan.  For the period ended
April 30, 2005,  the Fund earned  $30,590 as  securities  lending  fees,  net of
rebates and agency fees.

NOTE 6. CAPITAL
During the year ended October 31, 2004, the Fund purchased  97,300 of its shares
of common stock in the open market at a total cost of  $2,074,803.  The weighted
average  discount of these purchased shares comparing the purchased price to the
net asset  value at the time of  purchase  was 9.35%.  These  shares are held in
treasury. The Fund had no capital stock repurchase activity for the period ended
April 30, 2005.

   ++ Total investment return based on market value is calculated  assuming that
      shares of the Fund's  common stock were  purchased  at the closing  market
      price as of the beginning of the year, dividends,  capital gains and other
      distributions  were  reinvested  as  provided  for in the Fund's  dividend
      reinvestment  plan and then sold at the closing  market price per share on
      the last day of the  year.  The  computation  does not  reflect  any sales
      commission  investors  may incur in  purchasing  or selling  shares of the
      Fund.  The  total  investment  return  based  on the net  asset  value  is
      similarly  computed  except that the Fund's net asset value is substituted
      for the closing market value.
    * Return excludes the effect of the $2.15 per share dilution associated with
      the Fund's rights offering.
   ** The custody  credits are  attributable  to  interest  earned on U.S.  cash
      balances.  The ratios of total expenses  after custody  credits to average
      net assets are 1.21%, 1.26%, 1.50%, 1.54%, 1.62% and 1.35% for 2005, 2004,
      2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
  *** Annualized.
 **** Not Annualized.
***** Not Annualized. The ratio for six months ended April 30, 2005 has not been
      annualized since the Fund believes it would not be appropriate because the
      Fund's dividend income is not earned ratably throughout the fiscal year.

                         AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund offers  shareholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the
plan agent:
