LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                                  August 2, 2006

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

For the six month period ended June 30, 2006, the net asset value (NAV) of The
Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") increased by 1.27%, vs. an increase of 0.34% for
the Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile Index.*

The market price of the Fund's shares declined 16.60% in the period, closing at
US$14.72. As a result, the Fund's shares traded at a premium of 2.7% on June 30,
2006, compared with a 24.6% premium to NAV at the start of the period.

FUND NOW TRADING ON AMEX

Effective May 11, 2006, the Fund is listed on, and has commenced trading on, the
American Stock Exchange, LLC ("AMEX"). The Fund opted to make the move based on
listing costs. The Fund estimates that the Fund's annual listing fees will
decline substantially. The Fund continues to trade under the same ticker symbol
(CH).

MARKET OVERVIEW: CHILE TRAILS IN VOLATILE MARKET

The world's emerging equity markets had positive, though volatile, performance
in the period. The group started the year on a bright note, extending a strong
rally begun in 2003. Emerging markets turned sharply down in May, however, when
worries over US inflation and global interest-rates sparked a broad sell off
that hit riskier asset classes the hardest. The group suffered a peak-to-trough
fall of 25%, before staging a partial rebound late in the period.

Chile had only a marginal gain in the period, underperforming global emerging
markets and its regional peers. Stocks in Chile corrected by significantly less
than other Latin American markets during the May/June sell off, but the bounce
back was relatively mild. This was consistent with our view that Chile's market
is less susceptible to volatility in general, due to the depth of local capital
market demand.

In this environment, the Fund had only a modest gain, though it outperformed its
benchmark. Stocks that aided the Fund's return included its consumer stocks, in
particular consumer discretionary holdings. The Fund's materials companies also
outperformed, and the Fund's underweighting in the financial services sector was
beneficial as well, as financial stocks struggled. The Fund's industrial and
telecommunications holdings underperformed.

OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY

Against a global backdrop that we view as more challenging, given an
increasingly clouded outlook for global growth and frequent shifts in risk
appetite, here are some of the factors we consider noteworthy:

     -    Commodities have fallen from their peaks but copper, a key Chilean
          export, remains at high levels by historical standards.

     -    After poor readings in March and April, the Monthly Economic Activity
          Indicator, an index of economic activity, bounced in the May reading,
          and continues to suggest a growth rate of between 5.5% and 6.0% in
          2006.


                                       1

     -    The previously weak readings may explain why consumer confidence has
          dipped in recent surveys. Other factors that may have contributed
          include a) the energy crisis resulting from Argentina restricting
          natural gas supplies, b) the falling popularity of President Bachelet
          amid student protests, c) rising unemployment rates and d) rising
          interest rates.

     -    Our analysis, however, suggests a more positive economic picture. The
          increase in unemployment is mainly a reflection of the increased labor
          force participation. Job creation has actually been growing at a
          healthy rate of 4.2%.

     -    CPI inflation over the last twelve months is running at around 4%, at
          the top of the Central Bank's target range of 2-4%, but core inflation
          has been trending down again; we expect the Bank to raise rates by
          only another 25 basis points before pausing.

     -    The government's attempts to talk the peso down seems to have had some
          effect recently, with the currency weakening slightly to the Ch$540
          level against the US Dollar.

For our part, we will continue to look for reasonably valued companies we think
can deliver consistent earnings growth. From a sector perspective, we remain
overweighted in consumer areas such as beverages and specific retail stocks,
reflecting our view that consumption should be a main pillar in Chile's economy
in the next few years. We also continue to focus on the pulp and paper and
electricity industries, while remaining underweighted in telecoms and financial
services, based on risk/reward characteristics.

We would also note that, as the result of our sale of Infraestructura 2000 late
in the period (at a value 25% higher than the carrying value), the Fund as of
June 30, 2006 has no remaining private equity investments.

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

NOTE A. ORGANIZATION

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

NOTE B. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. Equity investments
are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the closing
price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the
time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are reported, equity
investments are generally valued at the most recent bid quotation as of the
Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of a short sale of
securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater than 60 days are
valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing service, which may use
a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes into consideration market
indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments. Debt obligations that will
mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of amortized cost, which
approximates market value, unless it is determined that this method would not
represent fair value. Investments in mutual funds are valued at the mutual
fund's closing net asset value per share on the day of valuation. Securities and
other assets for which market quotations are not readily available, or whose
values have been materially affected by events occurring before the Fund's
Valuation Time, but after the close of the securities' primary market, are
valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the direction of,
the Board of Directors under procedures established by the Board of Directors.
The Fund may utilize a service provided by an independent third party which has
been approved by the Board of Directors to fair value certain securities. When
fair-value pricing is employed, the prices of securities used by a fund to
calculate its net asset value may differ from quoted or published prices for the
same securities. The Fund's estimate of fair value assumes a willing buyer and a
willing seller neither acting under the compulsion to buy or sell.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term time
deposit available through Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Fund's custodian.
The short-term time deposit is a variable rate account classified as a
short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
U.S. income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and to make
the requisite distributions to its shareholders sufficient to relieve it from
all or substantially all U.S. income and excise taxes.


                                       12

<Page>

The Fund accrues foreign taxes on realized gains and repatriation taxes in an
amount equal to what the Fund would owe if the securities were sold and the
proceeds repatriated on the valuation date as a liability and reduction of
realized/unrealized gains. Taxes on foreign income are recorded when the related
income is recorded. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Fund incurred
$281,145 of such expense.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (I)  market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/depreciation in value of investments,
and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency
contracts, exchange gains or losses realized between the trade date and
settlement date on security transactions, and the difference between the amounts
of interest and dividends recorded on the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: The Fund invests in securities of foreign countries and governments which
involve certain risks in addition to those inherent in domestic investments.
Such risks generally include, among others, currency risks (fluctuations in
currency exchange rates), information risk (key information may be inaccurate or
unavailable) and political risk (expropriation,


                                       13

<Page>

nationalization or the imposition of capital or currency controls or punitive
taxes). Other risks of investing in foreign securities include liquidity and
valuation risks.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in the emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by that fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected
to be illiquid, which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk
and may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any
liquid trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to
liquidate these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities.
Although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions,
the prices realized on such sales could be substantially less than those
originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying values and these difference
could be material. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded
may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements
applicable to companies whose securities are publicly traded.

NOTE C. AGREEMENTS

Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("Credit Suisse") serves as the Fund's
investment adviser with respect to all investments. Credit Suisse receives as
compensation for its advisory services from the Fund, an annual fee, calculated
weekly and paid quarterly, equal to 1.20% of the first $50 million of the Fund's
average weekly market value or net assets (whichever is lower), 1.15% of the
next $50 million and 1.10% of amounts in excess of $100 million. For the six
months ended June 30, 2006, Credit Suisse earned $850,185 for advisory services.
Credit Suisse also provides certain administrative services to the Fund and is
reimbursed by the Fund for costs incurred on behalf of the Fund (up to $20,000
per annum). For the six months ended June 30, 2006, Credit Suisse was reimbursed
$9,917 for administrative services rendered to the Fund.

Celfin Capital Servicios Financieros S.A. ("Celfin") serves as the Fund's
Chilean sub-adviser. Celfin receives as compensation for its sub-advisory
services, an annual fee, out of the advisory fee payable to Credit Suisse,
calculated weekly and paid quarterly, equal to 0.20% of the Fund's average
weekly market value or net assets (whichever is lower). For the six months ended
June 30, 2006, these sub-advisory fees amounted to $147,817.

For the six months ended June 30, 2006, Celfin earned approximately $38,000 in
brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of the
Fund.


                                       14

<Page>

Bear Stearns Funds Management Inc. ("BSFM") serves as the Fund's U.S.
administrator. The Fund pays BSFM a monthly fee that is calculated weekly based
on the Fund's average weekly net assets. For the six months ended June 30, 2006,
BSFM earned $49,120 for administrative services.

Celfin Capital S.A. Administradora de Fondos de Capital Extranjero ("AFCE")
serves as the Fund's Chilean administrator. For its services, AFCE is paid a
fee, out of the advisory fee payable to Credit Suisse, that is calculated weekly
and paid quarterly at an annual rate of 0.05% of the Fund's average weekly
market value or net assets (whichever is lower). In addition, AFCE receives a
supplemental administration fee, an annual reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses and an accounting fee. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the
administration fees, supplemental administration fees and accounting fees
amounted to $36,954, $39,671 and $3,372, respectively.

Merrill Corporation ("Merrill"), an affiliate of Credit Suisse, has been engaged
by the Fund to provide certain financial printing services. For the six months
ended June 30, 2006, Merrill was paid $16,115 for its services to the Fund.

The Independent Directors receive fifty percent (50%) of their annual retainer
in the form of shares purchased by the Fund's transfer agent in the open market.
Directors as a group own less than 1% of the Fund's outstanding shares.

NOTE D. CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Fund is 100,000,000 shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value. Of the 10,139,926 shares outstanding at June 30, 2006, Credit
Suisse owned 14,615 shares.

NOTE E. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the six months ended June 30, 2006, purchases and sales of securities, other
than short-term investments, were $21,777,502 and $23,909,952, respectively.

NOTE F. CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund, together with other funds/portfolios advised by Credit Suisse
(collectively, the "Participating Funds"), participates in a $75 million
committed, unsecured, line of credit facility ("Credit Facility") with Deutsche
Bank, A.G. as administrative agent and syndication agent and State Street Bank
and Trust Company as operations agent for temporary or emergency purposes. Under
the terms of the Credit Facility, the Participating Funds pay an aggregate
commitment fee at a rate of 0.10% per annum on the average unused amount of the
Credit Facility, which is allocated among the Participating Funds in such manner
as is determined by the governing Boards of the Participating Funds. In
addition, the Participating Funds pay interest on borrowings at the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.50%. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Fund had
no borrowings under the Credit Facility.

NOTE G. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses
deferred due to wash sales and excise tax regulations.

At June 30, 2006, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, as well
as the gross unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from
investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value and the net
unrealized appreciation from investments were $91,620,062, $58,015,373,
$(3,393,097) and $54,622,276, respectively.


                                       15

<Page>

NOTE H. CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Fund may provide general indemnifications
pursuant to certain contracts and organizational documents. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made
against the Fund and, therefore, cannot be estimated; however, based on
experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.

DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED)

The InvestLink(SM) Program is sponsored and administered by Computershare Trust
Company N.A. ("Computershare"), not by the Fund. Computershare will act as
program administrator (the "Program Administrator") of the InvestLink(SM)
Program (the "Program"). The purpose of the Program is to provide existing
shareholders with a simple and convenient way to invest additional funds and
reinvest dividends in shares of the Fund's common stock ("Shares") at prevailing
prices, with reduced brokerage commissions and fees.

In order to participate in the Program, you must be a registered holder of at
least one Share of stock of the Fund. Purchases of Shares with funds from a
participant's cash payment or automatic account deduction will begin on the next
day on which funds are invested. All cash payments must be drawn on a U.S. bank
and payable in U.S. dollars. Checks must be made payable to Computershare. If a
participant selects the dividend reinvestment option, automatic investment of
dividends generally will begin with the next dividend payable after the Program
Administrator receives his enrollment form. Once in the Program, a person will
remain a participant until he terminates his participation or sells all Shares
held in his Program account, or his account is terminated by the Program
Administrator. A participant may change his investment options at any time by
requesting a new enrollment form and returning it to the Program Administrator.

A participant will be assessed certain charges in connection with his
participation in the Program. All optional cash deposit investments will be
subject to a service charge. Sales processed through the Program will have a
service fee deducted from the net proceeds, after brokerage commissions. In
addition to the transaction charges outlined above, participants will be
assessed per share processing fees (which include brokerage commissions.)
Participants will not be charged any fee for reinvesting dividends.

The number of Shares to be purchased for a participant depends on the amount of
his dividends, cash payments or bank account or payroll deductions, less
applicable fees and commissions, and the purchase price of the Shares. The
investment date for cash payments is the 25th day of each month (or the next
trading day if the 25th is not a trading day). The investment date for dividend
reinvestment is the dividend payment date. The Program Administrator uses
dividends and funds of participants to purchase Shares of the Fund in the open
market. Such purchases will be made by participating brokers as agent for the
participants using normal cash settlement practices. All Shares purchased
through the Program will be allocated to participants as of the settlement date,
which is usually three business days from the purchase date. In all cases,
transaction processing will occur within 30 days of the receipt of funds, except
where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the Federal Securities laws or when unusual market
conditions make prudent investment impracticable. In the event the Program
Administrator is unable to purchase Shares within 30 days of the receipt of
funds, such funds will be returned to the participants.

The average price of all Shares purchased by the Program Administrator with all
funds received during the time period from two business days preceding any
investment date up to the second business day preceding the next investment date
shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in connection with the
Shares purchased for his account with his funds or dividends received by the
Program Administrator during such time period. The average price of all Shares
sold by the Program Administrator pursuant to sell orders received during such
time period shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in
connection with the Shares sold for his account pursuant to his sell orders
received by the Program Administrator during such time period. All sale requests
having an

anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are expected to be submitted in
written form. In addition, all sale requests received by the Program
Administrator within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be
submitted in written form.

Computershare, as Program Administrator, administers the Program for
participants, keeps records, sends statements of account to participants and
performs other duties relating to the Program. Each participant in the Program
will receive a statement of his account following each purchase of Shares. The
statements will also show the amount of dividends credited to such participant's
account (if applicable), as well as the fees paid by the participant. In
addition, each participant will receive copies of the Fund's annual and
semi-annual reports to shareholders, proxy statements and, if applicable,
dividend income information for tax reporting purposes.

If the Fund is paying dividends on the Shares, a participant will receive
dividends through the Program for all Shares held on the dividend record date on
the basis of full and fractional Shares held in his account, and for all other
Shares of the Fund registered in his name. The Program Administrator will send
checks to the participants for the amounts of their dividends that are not to be
automatically reinvested at no cost to the participants.

Shares of the Fund purchased under the Program will be registered in the name of
the accounts of the respective participants. Unless requested, the Fund will not
issue to participants certificates for Shares of the Fund purchased under the
Program. The Program Administrator will hold the Shares in book-entry form until
a Program participant chooses to withdraw his Shares or terminate his
participation in the Program. The number of Shares purchased for a participant's
account under the Program will be shown on his statement of account. This
feature protects against loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates.

A participant may withdraw all or a portion of the Shares from his Program
account by notifying the Program Administrator. After receipt of a participant's
request, the Program Administrator will issue to such participant certificates
for the whole Shares of the Fund so withdrawn or, if requested by the
participant, sell the Shares for him and send him the proceeds, less applicable
brokerage commissions, fees, and transfer taxes, if any. If a participant
withdraws all full and fractional Shares in his Program account, his
participation in the Program will be terminated by the Program Administrator. In
no case will certificates for fractional Shares be issued. The Program
Administrator will convert any fractional Shares held by a participant at the
time of his withdrawal to cash.

Participation in any rights offering, dividend distribution or stock split will
be based upon both the Shares of the Fund registered in participants' names and
the Shares (including fractional Shares) credited to participants' Program
accounts. Any stock dividend or Shares resulting from stock splits with respect
to Shares of the Fund, both full and fractional, which participants hold in
their Program accounts and with respect to all Shares registered in their names
will be automatically credited to their accounts.

All Shares of the Fund (including any fractional share) credited to his account
under the Program will be voted as the participant directs. The participants
will be sent the proxy materials for the annual meetings of shareholders. When a
participant returns an executed proxy, all of such Shares will be voted as
indicated. A participant may also elect to vote his Shares in person at the
Shareholders' meeting.


                                       20

A participant will receive tax information annually for his personal records and
to help him prepare his U.S. federal income tax return. The automatic
reinvestment of dividends does not relieve him of any income tax which may be
payable on dividends. For further information as to tax consequences of
participation in the Program, participants should consult with their own tax
advisors.

The Program Administrator in administering the Program will not be liable for
any act done in good faith or for any good faith omission to act. However, the
Program Administrator will be liable for loss or damage due to error caused by
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Shares held in custody by the
Program Administrator are not subject to protection under the Securities
Investors Protection Act of 1970.

The participant should recognize that neither the Fund nor the Program
Administrator can provide any assurance of a profit or protection against loss
on any Shares purchased under the Program. A participant's investment in Shares
held in his Program account is no different than his investment in directly held
Shares in this regard. The participant bears the risk of loss and the benefits
of gain from market price changes with respect to all of his Shares. Neither the
Fund nor the Program Administrator can guarantee that Shares purchased under the
Program will, at any particular time, be worth more or less than their purchase
price. Each participant must make an independent investment decision based on
his own judgment and research.

While the Program Administrator hopes to continue the Program indefinitely, the
Program Administrator reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Program at
any time. It also reserves the right to make modifications to the Program.
Participants will be notified of any such suspension, termination or
modification in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program. The
Program Administrator also reserves the right to terminate any participant's
participation in the Program at any time. Any question of interpretation arising
under the Program will be determined in good faith by the Program Administrator
and any such good faith determination will be final.

Any interested shareholder may participate in the Program. All other cash
payments or bank account deductions must be at least $100.00, up to a maximum of
$100,000.00 annually. An interested shareholder may join the Program by reading
the Program description, completing and signing the enrollment form and
returning it to the Program Administrator. The enrollment form and information
relating to the Program (including the terms and conditions) may be obtained by
calling the Program Administrator at one of the following telephone numbers:
(800) 730-6001 (U.S. and Canada) or (781) 575-3100 (outside U.S. and Canada).
All correspondence regarding the Program should be directed to: Computershare
