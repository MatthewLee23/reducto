                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management groups--
                            Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

     Franklin Templeton
     Limited Duration Income Trust

     YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
     Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary
     objective of capital appreciation to the extent it is possible and
     consistent with the Fund's primary objective, through a portfolio
     consisting primarily of high yield corporate bonds, floating rate bank
     loans and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities.

     Dear Shareholder:

     We are pleased to bring you Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
     Trust's annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.

     PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

     For the 12 months under review, Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
     Trust had cumulative total returns of +43.18% based on net asset value and
     +63.14% based on market price. Net asset value increased from $10.15 per
     share on March 31, 2009, to $13.48 at period-end, and the market price rose

     activity as measured by gross domestic product registered annualized
     quarterly growth rates of -0.7%, 2.2% and 5.6% in the last three quarters
     of 2009 and an estimated 3.2% in 2010's first quarter. Remaining challenges
     to economic recovery included elevated debt concerns, tight credit markets,
     stalled consumer confidence, restrained spending, and lack of job prospects
     for the unemployed as federal stimulus measures began to wind down. The
     unemployment rate, which peaked at 10.1% in October 2009, stood at 9.7% by
     period-end.(1)

     As economic conditions improved, demand for energy products increased and
     crude oil prices rose from $50 per barrel in March 2009 to $84 at
     period-end, still well below 2008 highs. March's inflation rate was an
     annualized 2.3%.(1) Core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs,
     rose at a 1.1% annualized rate,(1) which was below the Federal Reserve
     Board's (Fed's) informal target range of 1.5% to 2.0%. The core personal
     consumption expenditures price index reported a 12-month increase of 1.3%
     for the second month in a row.(2)

     During the period under review, economic improvement and benign inflation
     trends prompted Fed policymakers to maintain record-low interest rates and
     discontinue certain stimulus plans. Noting that it believed the recession
     had ended, the Fed left the federal funds target rate unchanged at a range
     of 0% to 0.25% and began laying the groundwork for its exit strategy. The
     market anticipated an eventual tightening of monetary policy and a gradual
     phase-out of the Fed's support and liquidity programs.

     In February 2010, investor fears over the Greek government's ability to
     finance its budget deficit forced several companies to delay bond sales and
     prompted investors to flee to safer assets such as U.S. Treasuries. These
     fears largely subsided by period-end, and the credit market rebounded
     although uncertainty remained about how several European countries would
     meet their debt obligations. U.S. companies aggressively borrowed in the
     debt market and liquidity levels rose.

     Wary investors favored short-term Treasuries, and the Treasury yield curve
     reached all-time steep levels in February. The spread between two- and
     10-year Treasury yields increased from 190 basis points (100 basis points
     equal one percentage point) at the beginning of the period to 282 basis
     points at period-end. The two-year Treasury bill yield rose from 0.81% to
     1.02% over the 12-month period, while the 10-year Treasury note yield rose
     from 2.71% to 3.84%.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We primarily invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily
high yield corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and
mortgage-and other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of
macroeconomic trends combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market
sectors, industries and issuers drives our investment process. We seek to
maintain a limited duration, or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the
impact that fluctuating interest rates might have on the Fund's fixed income
portfolio. Within the corporate bond and bank loan sectors, we seek securities
trading at reasonable valuations from issuers with characteristics such as
strong market positions, stable cash flows, reasonable capital structures,
supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and improving credit fundamentals.
In the mortgage- and other asset-backed securities sector, we look to capture an
attractive income stream and total return through our analysis of security
prepayment assumptions, possible pricing inefficiencies and underlying
collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's fiscal year was marked by a remarkable recovery from one of the worst
economic environments in modern history. With unprecedented amounts of
government stimulus being applied around the globe, most risky assets began to
recover in late 2008 or early 2009, and equity markets rose significantly.
Meanwhile, as investors became more convinced the economy would recover, raising
concerns of higher inflation, the 10-year Treasury note yield increased from
2.71% at the end of March 2009 to 3.84% at the end of March 2010. During the
same period, the Fed kept short-term interest rates extremely low.

In the prevailing environment of improving economic prospects and low short-term
interest rates, investors increasingly sought out risky assets, thus driving
returns for such securities sharply higher. High yield corporate bonds returned
+52.27% as measured by the Credit Suisse (CS) High Yield Index, while leveraged
loans returned +41.06% as measured by the CS Leveraged Loan Index.(3)
Mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are generally higher quality and lower
yield than other fixed income securities, generated a more modest +5.21% return
as measured by the Barclays Capital (BC) U.S. MBS Index.(4) Within the credit

portion of our portfolio, we liquidated investment-grade corporate positions we
had purchased at cheaper valuations, as those bonds were again trading at prices
near historical averages. We used the proceeds to increase our high yield
corporate bond and leveraged loan exposures, and the Fund ended the period with
overweighted positions in both of these asset classes relative to MBS and
asset-backed securities (ABS). We reduced our MBS exposure, partly to invest in
what we believed were more attractively valued ABS and partly due to relative
performance versus the Fund's other assets.

HIGH YIELD CORPORATE BONDS

High yield corporate bonds generated positive returns every month during the
Fund's fiscal year. After suffering severely from the deep credit crisis, high
yield corporate bonds began the period with attractive valuations and yields
above 17%.(5) As signs of economic improvement became more widespread, fears of
record default levels abated and investors seemed to believe the market had
overreacted. In addition, the new-issue market gradually opened, allowing
companies to refinance debt to extend maturities or to eliminate onerous bank
covenants. This refinancing activity led to further decreases in default
expectations and enabled bond yields and spreads to tighten. Following the
remarkable rally over the past fiscal year, valuations were in line with
historical averages. At year-end, we had a favorable outlook for high yield
corporate issuers' fundamentals, and we maintained a slightly overweighted
position.

FLOATING RATE BANK LOANS

The bank loan asset class delivered strong returns for the year, and lower
credit-quality loans outperformed higher credit-quality loans. The loan rally
was supported by strong liquidity in the finance system, which allowed companies
to refinance their bank debt through the high yield bond and public equity
markets. In particular, the bond-for-loan conversion returned significant cash
to loan investors, which forced them to redeploy the cash in the secondary loan
market. Demand strengthened in the secondary market because supply was limited
in the primary market. As a result, secondary loan prices increased from 75
cents on the dollar on March 31, 2009, to 94.9 at period-end, and the average
discounted spread to maturity (the interest rate margin over LIBOR, factoring
the current trading price and the loan's maturity) tightened from 991 basis
points to 370 basis points over the same period.(6)

Merger and acquisition activity also benefited some leveraged companies that
were acquired by larger and better-capitalized companies who subsequently repaid
loans at par. In addition, loan fund inflows and year-end loan amortization
payments also returned cash to investors and contributed to the loan market's
continued strength. With improvement in credit markets, several issuers extended
loan maturities through amendments to their credit agreements, with a few
issuers returning for second extensions. These actions benefited investors with
higher spreads, which also helped secondary market prices. Overall, the
environment remained positive for the loan market as the high percentage of
loans coming due from 2012 to 2014 was slowly being addressed.

With issuers' improved access to capital markets and their ability to amend and
extend loan maturities, the loan default rate trended lower from its peak of
10.8% in November 2009 to 5.8% at the period-end, according to S&P Leveraged
Commentary and Data.(6)

MORTGAGE- AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

During the Fund's fiscal year, the overall MBS market delivered solid results
but lagged the robust performance of the high yield corporate bond and bank loan
sectors. The Fed's MBS purchase program continued to support the agency MBS
market but was concluded at period-end. With a lack of consistent investor
demand outside Fed purchases, we anticipate less favorable technical conditions
and higher volatility.

The Fund's coupon allocation remained relatively constant over the period.
Prepayment risk for higher coupon MBS remained restrained as stagnant home
prices, loss of home equity and tighter underwriting standards lessened
prepayment activity. The Fund's heaviest allocation remained in the 5.0% to 6.0%
range.

Outside conventional MBS, the Fund remained allocated to higher quality
securitized sectors with strong credit fundamentals, specifically those related
to commercial real estate. During the period, the Term Asset-Backed Securities
Lending Facility (TALF) was successful in supporting the commercial MBS and
consumer ABS markets.

PERFORMANCE DATA REPRESENT PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE
RESULTS. INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND YOU MAY HAVE
A GAIN OR LOSS WHEN YOU SELL YOUR SHARES. CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY DIFFER FROM
FIGURES SHOWN.

ENDNOTES

INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS WILL AFFECT THE FUND'S SHARE
PRICE AND YIELD. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER YIELDING, LOWER RATED
SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT AND LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.

(1.) Figures are for common shares. As of 3/31/10, the Fund had leverage in the
     amount of 32.01% of the Fund's total assets. The Fund employs leverage
     through the issuance of Auction Preferred Shares and purchase of Mortgage
     Dollar Rolls. The use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
     increased income but, at the same time, creates special risks (including
     the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
     common shares). The cost of leverage rises and falls with changes in
     short-term interest rates. Such increases/decreases in the cost of the
     Fund's leverage may be offset by increased/decreased income from the Fund's
     floating rate investments.

(2.) Total return calculations represent the cumulative and average annual
     changes in value of an investment over the periods indicated.

(3.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions at net asset value.

(4.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions based on the dividend reinvestment
     plan.

(5.) Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the Fund's 7.6 cent per
     share March dividend and the NYSE Amex closing price of $13.40 on 3/31/10.

Important Notice to Shareholders

AMENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS OF THE TRUST

The Bylaws of the Trust have been amended as follows, effective February 23,
2010:

                                   ARTICLE IX
                     COMPLIANCE WITH FITCH RATING GUIDELINES

     Section 1. OVERCOLLATERALIZATION TESTS. For as long as the Trust has
outstanding Auction Preferred Shares, Series M, Series W or Series F
(collectively, "AP Shares"), as described in that certain Statement of
Preferences of Auction Rate Preferred Shares (the "Statement") dated October 20,
2003, and the AP Shares are rated by Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"), the Trust shall
maintain asset coverage ratios with respect to the Fitch Total
Overcollateralization Test ("Fitch Total OC Test") and the Fitch Net
Overcollateralization Test ("Fitch Net OC Test") consistent with maintaining a
Fitch rating of AAA, as described by Fitch in CLOSED-END FUND DEBT AND PREFERRED
STOCK RATING CRITERIA dated August 17, 2009, as the same may be amended from
time to time and made publicly available by Fitch on its website or such other
location as Fitch may designate by reasonable notice (collectively, the "Fitch
OC Tests").

     Section 2. VALUATION PERIOD. The Trust shall calculate its compliance with
the Fitch OC Tests weekly (each such weekly calculation date to be referred to
as a "Valuation Date") and will send the calculation to Fitch monthly.

     Section 3. CURE PERIOD. If in any weekly valuation the Trust fails to
comply with the Fitch OC Tests, the Trust shall have ten (10) business days from
such Valuation Date to restore compliance with such coverage ratios (such tenth
(10th) business day to be referred to as the "Cure Date"). The Trust may restore
compliance through any combination of deleveraging, portfolio rebalancing,
suspending dividends or distribution payments on common shares, or such other
means as the officers of the Trust deem necessary, desirable or appropriate to
restore compliance with the Fitch OC Tests.

     Section 4. MANDATORY REDEMPTION. In the event that the Trust fails to
comply with the Fitch OC Tests on a Valuation Date and fails to restore
compliance by the close of business on the Cure Date, the Trust shall conduct a
mandatory redemption of AP Shares in accordance with Section 9(b) of Part I of
the Statement and such other provisions of the Statement as shall be applicable
to mandatory redemptions. Such mandatory redemption shall take place within
thirty (30) days of the Cure Date (the date on which the redemption takes place
to be referred to as the "Redemption Date"). During the period between the Cure
Date and the Redemption Date, the Trust shall not issue or incur additional
leverage, nor declare or pay dividends or distribution on common shares.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Plan) offers you a prompt and simple way
to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions (Distributions) in shares
of the Fund. PNC Global Investment Servicing (Agent), P.O. Box 43027,
Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the Plan. The
Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as your
outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.


                               10 | Annual Report

<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
NYSE Amex, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange on such date. The
net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the amount most recently
calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will


                               Annual Report | 11

<PAGE>

be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to your account.
If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will adjust for any such
undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of shares at the time
of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at (800) 331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (Fund) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Equity and other securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ
National Market System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official
closing price of the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of
the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple
markets or on multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most
representative market. Certain equity securities are valued based upon
fundamental characteristics or relationships to similar securities. Investments
in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.

Corporate debt securities, government securities, mortgage backed securities,
asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and other debt
securities generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a
securities exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services,
quotations from bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and note
transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for each security.
The Fund's pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing which
considers information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions,
quotations from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities that are
considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and
maturity date, option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections, interest
rate spreads and yield curves, to determine current value. Debt securities
denominated in a foreign currency are converted into their U.S. dollar
equivalent at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on
the date that the values of the foreign debt securities are determined.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis, to determine
current value.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A. SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis based upon the underlying investment book value,
anticipated future cash flows, market changes in comparable or similar
securities, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar securities,
or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions on the
disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of
such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed.
Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a security is
completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question the
availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio security
held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued using
fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. The Fund may enter
into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate transactions denominated
in a foreign currency. Purchases and sales of securities, income and expense
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Occasionally, events may impact
the availability or reliability of foreign exchange rates used to convert the
U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an event occurs, the foreign exchange rate
will be valued at fair value using procedures established and approved by the
Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY, AND TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery, and
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to
the risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date
purchase price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with
the intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date. Sufficient assets have been segregated for these securities.

D. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Fund may invest in derivative financial instruments (derivatives) in order
to manage risk or gain exposure to various other investments or markets.
Derivatives are financial contracts based on an underlying or notional amount,
require no initial investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than
would normally be required to have a similar response to changes in market
factors, and require or permit net settlement. Derivatives may contain various
risks including the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill their
obligations under the terms of the contract, the potential for an illiquid
secondary market, and the potential for market movements which may expose the
Fund to gains or losses in excess of the amounts shown on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

Derivatives are marked to market daily based upon quotations from market makers
or the Fund's independent pricing services and the Fund's net benefit or
obligation under the contract, as measured by the fair market value of the
contract, is included in net assets. Realized gain and loss and unrealized
appreciation and depreciation on these contracts for the period are included in
the Statement of Operations.

The Fund generally enters into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge
against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain
foreign currencies. A forward exchange contract is an agreement between the Fund
and a counterparty to buy or sell a foreign currency for a specific exchange
rate on a future date.

See Note 11 regarding other derivative information.

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund may enter into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a TBA basis.
Mortgage dollar rolls are agreements between the Fund and a financial
institution to simultaneously sell and repurchase mortgage-backed securities at
a future date. Gains or losses are realized on the initial sale, and the
difference between the repurchase price and the sale price is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss to the Fund upon entering into the mortgage dollar roll.
In addition, the Fund may invest the cash proceeds that are received from the
initial sale. During the period between the sale

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS (CONTINUED)

and repurchase, the Fund is not entitled to principal and interest paid on the
mortgage backed securities. The risks of mortgage dollar roll transactions
include the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations.

The Fund is investing in mortgage dollar rolls as an alternate form of leverage.
As a result, the mortgage dollar rolls are considered indebtedness or a "senior
security" for purposes of the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.

F. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

G. INCOME TAXES

It is the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code and to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its
taxable income and net realized gains. As a result, no provision for federal
income taxes is required. The Fund files U.S. income tax returns as well as tax
returns in certain other jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2010, and for all open
tax years, the Fund has determined that no provision for income tax is required
in the Fund's financial statements. Open tax years are those that remain subject
to examination by such taxing authorities, which in the case of the U.S. is
three years after the filing of a fund's tax return.

H. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences
may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among
capital

accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no impact
on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At March 31, 2010, there were an unlimited number of common shares authorized
(without par value). During the years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, there were
no shares issued; all reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously
issued shares purchased in the open market.

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003, the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. During the year
ended March 31, 2009, there was a pro rata preferred redemption of each series
totaling 4,000 shares and $100,000,000 leaving 1,200 Preferred Shares Series M,
1,200 Preferred Shares Series W and 1,200 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference totaling $90,000,000. Dividends to preferred
shareholders are cumulative

and are declared weekly, at rates established through an auction process. The
weekly auctions for Series M, W and F have all failed during the year ended
March 31, 2010; consequently, the dividend rate paid on the Preferred Shares has
moved to the maximum rate as defined in the prospectus. During the year ended
March 31, 2010, the dividends on Preferred Shares ranged from 1.46% to 1.66%.

The Fund is required to maintain, on a weekly basis, a specified discounted
value of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch
Ratings and Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset
coverage for the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the year ended March 31, 2010, all requirements were met.

4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Franklin Resources, Inc. is the holding company for various subsidiaries that
together are referred to as Franklin Templeton Investments. Certain officers and
trustees of the Fund are also officers and/or directors of the following
subsidiaries:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

The Fund pays an investment management fee and administrative fee to Advisers
and FT Services of 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively, per year of the average daily
managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the Fund's gross asset value minus
the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the liquidation value of the
Preferred Shares and other financial leverage.

5. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2010, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of defaulted securities, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, payments-in-kind, and bond
discounts and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, payments-in-kind, and bond
discounts and premiums.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
year ended March 31, 2010, aggregated $1,078,893,838 and $1,065,353,326,
respectively.

8. INVESTMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market Portfolio
(Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by Advisers.
Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep
Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative fees
paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

9. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES

At March 31, 2010, the Fund had 68.10% of its portfolio invested in high yield,
senior secured floating rate notes, or other securities rated below investment
grade. These securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions causing
greater price volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk of loss
due to default than higher rated securities.

The Fund held defaulted securities and/or other securities for which the income
has been deemed uncollectible. At March 31, 2010, the aggregate value of these
securities was $727,125, representing 0.14% of the Fund's portfolio. The Fund
discontinues accruing income on securities for which income has been deemed
uncollectible and provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable. The
securities have been identified on the accompanying Statement of Investments.

10. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrowers' discretion. Funded portions of credit agreements are presented on the
Statement of Investments.

At March 31, 2010, unfunded commitments were as follows:

or creditors' committees which, pursuant to the Fund's policies and requirements
of applicable securities laws, could prevent the Fund from trading in the
securities of such company for limited or extended periods of time.

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund follows a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market data
obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own market
assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining the
value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair value
hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of March 31, 2010, in valuing
the Fund's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

14. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an
Accounting Standards Update which enhances and clarifies existing fair value
measurement disclosure requirements and is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The Fund believes the adoption of
this Accounting Standards Update will not have a material impact on its
financial statements.

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Fund has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of the financial
statements and determined that no events have occurred that require disclosure.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FRANKLIN TEMPLETON LIMITED DURATION
INCOME TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust (the "Fund") at March 31, 2010, the results of its operations for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at March 31, 2010 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Limited Duration Income Trust

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held February 23, 2010, the Board of Trustees (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust (Fund). In reaching this decision, the Board took into account information
furnished throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information
prepared specifically in connection with the annual renewal review process.
Information furnished and discussed throughout the year included investment
performance reports on the Fund, information on its share price discount to net
asset value, and other related financial information, as well as periodic
reports on legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates.
Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process
included a report prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent
organization, as well as additional material, including a Fund profitability
analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's
investment performance and expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable
to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report
discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall
U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included
with such profitability analysis report was information on a fund-by-fund basis
listing portfolio managers and other accounts they manage, as well as
information on management fees charged by the Manager and its affiliates to U.S.
funds and other accounts, including management's explanation of differences
where relevant, and a three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any
increase in expense ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a
memorandum prepared by management describing project initiatives and capital
investments relating to the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin
Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to
economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished it showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

personnel with the code of ethics adopted throughout the Franklin Templeton fund
complex, the adherence to fair value pricing procedures established by the
Board, and the accuracy of net asset value calculations. Favorable consideration
was given to management's efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up
systems and recovery procedures to function in the event of a natural disaster,
it being noted by the Board that such systems and procedures had functioned
smoothly during the Florida hurricanes and blackouts experienced in recent
years. Among other factors taken into account by the Board were the Manager's
best execution trading policies, including a favorable report by an independent
portfolio trading analytical firm. Consideration was also given to the
experience of the Fund's portfolio management team, the number of accounts
managed and general method of compensation. In this latter respect, the Board
noted that a primary factor in management's determination of the level of a
portfolio manager's bonus compensation was the relative investment performance
of the funds he or she managed and that a portion of such bonus was required to
be invested in a predesignated list of funds within such person's fund
management area so as to be aligned with the interests of Fund shareholders.
Particular attention was given to management's conservative approach and
diligent risk management procedures, including continuous monitoring of
counterparty credit risk and attention given to derivatives and other complex
instruments. The Board also took into account, among other things, the strong
financial position of the Manager's parent company and its commitment to the
fund business as evidenced by its subsidization of money market funds. The Board
also noted management's efforts to minimize any negative impact on the nature
and quality of services provided the Fund arising from Franklin Templeton
Investments' implementation of a hiring freeze and employee reductions in
response to market conditions during the latter part of 2008 and early 2009.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement renewal.
The Lipper report prepared for the Fund showed its investment performance in
comparison with a performance universe consisting of the Fund and all leveraged
closed-end BBB-rated corporate debt funds as selected by Lipper during 2009 and
the five previous calendar years. Such report considers both income return and
total return on a net asset value basis without regard to market discounts or
premiums to accurately reflect investment performance. The Lipper report showed
the Fund's income return for 2009 to be in the middle quintile of such
performance universe and its income return on an annualized basis to be in the
second-highest quintile of such universe for the previous three- and five-year
periods. The Lipper report showed the Fund's 2009 total return to be in the
second-highest quintile in such performance universe, and on an annualized basis
to be in the second-highest quintile and highest quintile of such universe for
the previous three- and five-year periods, respectively. The Board was satisfied
with the Fund's performance as shown in the Lipper report.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a Lipper
expense group consisting of the Fund and three other leveraged closed-end
BBB-rated corporate debt funds as selected by Lipper. Lipper expense data is
based upon information taken from each fund's most recent annual report, which
reflects historical asset levels that may be quite different from those
currently existing, particularly in a period of market volatility. While
recognizing such inherent limitation and the fact that expense ratios generally
increase as assets decline and decrease as assets grow, the Board believed the
independent analysis conducted by Lipper to be an appropriate measure of
comparative expenses. In reviewing comparative costs, Lipper provides
information on the Fund's contractual investment management fee rate in
comparison with the contractual investment management fee that would have been
charged by other funds within its Lipper expense group assuming they were
similar in size to the Fund, as well as the actual total expense ratio of the
Fund in comparison with those of its Lipper expense group. The Lipper
contractual investment management fee analysis includes administrative charges
as being part of contractual investment management fees. The results of such
expense comparisons showed that the Fund's contractual investment management fee
rate was the second highest in its Lipper expense group, but within five basis
points of its Lipper expense group median, while its actual total expense ratio,
including investment related expenses and taxes, was the lowest of such expense
group. The Board found such expenses to be acceptable.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund during the 12-month period ended September 30, 2009, being the most
recent fiscal year-end for Franklin Resources, Inc., the Manager's parent. In
reviewing the analysis, attention was given to the methodology followed in
allocating costs to the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies
are inherently subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be
reasonable while producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted
that, while being continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's
own cost accounting, such cost allocation methodology was consistent with that
followed in profitability report presentations made in prior years and that the
Fund's independent registered public accounting firm had been engaged by the
Manager to review the reasonableness of the allocation methodologies solely for
use by the Fund's Board in reference to the profitability analysis. In reviewing
and discussing such analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief
that costs incurred in establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of
fund operations conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully
reflected in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its
profitability, as well as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain
extent, reflected operational cost savings and efficiencies initiated by
management. In addition, the Board considered a third-party study comparing the
profitability of the Manager's parent on an overall basis as compared to other
publicly held managers broken

down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution
expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses. The Board
also considered the extent to which the Manager and its affiliates might derive
ancillary benefits from fund operations, as well as potential benefits resulting
from allocation of fund brokerage and the use of commission dollars to pay for
research. Based upon its consideration of all these factors, the Board
determined that the level of profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates
from providing services to the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature,
quality and extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders and intends to monitor
future growth of the Fund accordingly.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

The Fund's investment manager has established Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) that the Fund uses to determine how to vote proxies
relating to portfolio securities. Shareholders may view the Fund's complete

also made available online at franklintempleton.com and posted on the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at sec.gov and reflect the most
recent 12-month period ended June 30.

Exchange Commission for the first and third quarters for each fiscal year on

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.            N/A

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies. The manager votes proxies solely in the interests
of the Fund and its shareholders.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third-party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third-party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of policy, the
officers, directors/trustees and employees of the manager and the Proxy Group
will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with the
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve all
conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client,
distributor, broker dealer and vendor lists, information periodically gathered
from directors and officers, and information derived from other sources,
including public filings. In situations where a material conflict of interest is
identified, the Proxy Group may defer to the voting recommendation of
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of
proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with the manager's
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If the conflict is not resolved
by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter, along with the recommended
course of action by the manager, if any, to an interdepartmental Proxy Review
Committee (which may include portfolio managers and/or research analysts
employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy
Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass
Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of proxy services; or
send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group or the Proxy Review
Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board or a committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third-party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on any one of Sections 12(d)(1)(E), (F), or (G) of
the 1940 Act, or pursuant to an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests
uninvested cash in affiliated money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive
order ("cash sweep arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's
governing documents or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment
manager will vote the shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the
other holders of the Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. The manager will closely
scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the
manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit
fees. The manager will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
rotate auditors, and will vote against the ratification of auditors when there
is clear and compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. However, as
with all proxy issues, the manager conducts an independent review of each
anti-takeover proposal. On occasion, the manager may vote with management when
the research analyst has concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would
not harm the Fund or its shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports
proposals that require shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject
to a shareholder vote and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case
basis to determine whether or not they warrant support. In addition, the manager
will generally vote against any proposal to issue stock that has unequal or
subordinate voting rights. The manager generally opposes any supermajority
voting requirements as well as the payment of "greenmail." The manager generally
supports "fair price" provisions and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager realizes that a company's financing
decisions have a significant impact on its shareholders, particularly when they
involve the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock or the
assumption of additional debt. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase. The manager will generally not vote in favor of dual-class capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares where that class of stock
would have superior voting rights. The manager will generally vote in favor of
the issuance of preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
dividend, conversion and other rights of such stock and the terms of the
preferred stock issuance are deemed reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether they would be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring proposals are also subject to a thorough examination on
a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
the manager's proxy voting decisions for international investments. However, the
manager must be flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied
market practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

voting records are available online at franklintempleton.com and posted on the
SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV. The proxy voting records are updated each year by
August 31 to reflect the most recent 12-month period ended June 30.

</TABLE>

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual manager listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures help to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. The separate management of the trade execution and
valuation functions from the portfolio management process also helps to reduce
potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected for funds or
accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected for the
Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and mutual fund shares (17.5% to 25%).
         The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to build a vested
         interest of the portfolio manager in the financial performance of both
         Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The bonus plan is
         intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation
         that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving consistently strong
         investment performance, which aligns the financial incentives of the
         portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief Investment Officer
         of the manager and/or other officers of the manager, with
         responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of annual
         bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin Templeton
         guidelines. The following factors are generally used in determining
         bonuses under the plan:

     o    INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to the
          historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding years of
          all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The pre-tax performance
          of each fund  managed is measured  relative  to a relevant  peer group
          and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

     o    NON-INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.  The more qualitative  contributions of a
          portfolio  manager  to  the  manager's  business  and  the  investment
          management  team,  including  professional  knowledge,   productivity,
          responsiveness  to client needs and  communication,  are  evaluated in
          determining the amount of any bonus award.

     o    RESPONSIBILITIES.  The characteristics and complexity of funds managed
          by the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of Resources stock or
         restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds, and options to
         purchase common shares of Resources stock. Awards of such deferred
         equity-based compensation typically vest over time, so as to create
         incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 22, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

     This  Code  shall be the sole  code of  ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

     Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  has  separately  adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS  CONDUCT  ("Business  Conduct"),  which is  applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It  summarizes  the values,  principles  and business  practices  that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers,  directors and employees  regarding the minimum  ethical  requirements
expected of them. It supplements  the values,  principles  and business  conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

     Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the CODE
OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal  securities
trading and other related  matters.  The Code for Insider  Trading  provides for
separate  requirements  that  apply to the  Covered  Officers  and  others,  and
therefore is not part of this Code.

     Insofar as other  policies or procedures of Franklin  Resources,  Inc., the
Funds, the Funds' adviser,  principal  underwriter,  or other service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are  subject to this Code,  they are  superceded  by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the  provisions  of this Code.  Please review
these other  documents or consult with the Legal  Department  if have  questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service to, the FT
Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,  or
a member of his  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the FT Funds and  already  are  subject  to  conflict  of
interest  provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds.  The FT Funds'
and the investment  advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the FT Funds,  the  investment  advisers and the fund  administrator  of
which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this
Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser,  the  administrator,
or for all  three),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and  implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The  participation  of the  Covered  Officers in such  activities  is
inherent in the contractual  relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds.  Thus,  if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized  by the FT Funds'  Boards  of  Directors  ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
