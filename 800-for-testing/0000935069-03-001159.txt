LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                 August 25, 2003
Dear Shareholder,

   The German equity market staged a major rebound from its low point reached on
March 12, 2003. Stock market sentiment has substantially  improved mainly due to
reduced  uncertainties related to the Iraq war and investors are refocusing once
more on fundamentals,  such as valuations and growth.  Another  important factor
has been Chancellor  Schroeder's  proposed reform program, the so-called "Agenda
2010".   Its  most   important   aim  is  to  increase   the  German   economy's
competitiveness  and  thus  reduce   unemployment.   Additionally,   the  German
government  announced  its  intention to bring  forward major income tax cuts to
stimulate  consumption.  Finally,  the European  Central Bank continued its easy
monetary policy stance by reducing its benchmark rate to 2%.

   For the six months ended June 30, 2003,  the net asset value per share of the
Germany Fund increased  19.1% and its share price  increased  21.7%.  The Fund's
benchmark,  the DAX index, increased by 22.2% in US dollar terms during the same
period.  Second quarter  returns were  exceptionally  strong with the Fund's net
asset value up by 41.1%, its share price up 38.5% and the DAX index up 40.1%.

   The financial  sector was again the key to  performance in the second quarter
as The Germany Fund  benefited  from its  exposure to the banking and  insurance
industries.  Both sectors recovered  strongly from their weak performance during
the first  quarter as the European  Central Bank  signaled  its  willingness  to
further cut interest rates.  Investors  generally  interpreted this as a sign of
reduced leverage and financial stability. Another positive factor was the Fund's
exposure to Bayer,  as the ongoing  Baycol  litigation  risk declined  after the
court ruled  twice in favor of the  company and a large  number of cases are now
settled  out  of  court.   Expecting   profit   warnings  from   Volkswagen  and
DaimlerChrysler,  the Fund held most of its automotive  exposure in BMW. Earlier
this year BMW announced its strongest  product  launch in the firms'  history by
introducing three new car models throughout 2003.

   The Germany Fund continued its open-market purchases of its shares, buying
175,900 shares during the first six months of 2003. The Fund's discount to its
net asset value averaged 11.9% during this period.

                           Sincerely,

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   QUESTION:  What makes you think that the "Agenda  2010"  reform  package will
actually go through in its entirety,  without being diluted by special  interest
groups?

   ANSWER:  "Reform"  has  certainly  become  one of the most  cliched  words in
Germany today.  In view of lame growth,  stubbornly  rising  unemployment  and a
social  security  system  beset with major  financing  problems,  there is broad
consensus  about the fact that  something  has to change.  The "Agenda  2010" is
certainly not a concept that will solve Germany's  structural  problems once and
for all,  but it  represents  a major turn around from the vantage  point of the
left-wing party base and parts of the trade unions. Mr. Schroeder has linked his
political fate to the Agenda,  and it seems that he has gained the upper hand in
his own party.  The proposed reform package  received the blessing of around 90%
of the delegates at the Social Democratic Party's  extraordinary  party congress
in Berlin  on June 1st  after a fierce  debate  and some  concessions  regarding
transition  periods  for  unemployment  payments  and the special  situation  of
Eastern  Germany.  Interestingly,  the opposition  has already  signaled that it
might support Mr. Schroeder's reform package,  as long as the key issues are not
watered down and reform continues.

   QUESTION: Assuming the reform is on track, what are some of the key proposals
in Chancellor  Schroeder's  proposed reform program and how would it benefit the
German economy?

   ANSWER:  The core of the reform measures is that the state healthcare  system
will no longer pay for certain  benefits,  and going  forward it will have to be
financed either by the beneficiaries themselves or by the taxpayer. Higher extra
payments for drugs and visits to the doctor and measures to increase competition
among medical  providers and pharmacies should lead to a reduction in healthcare
expenditures.  It is estimated  that the overall cost to the  healthcare  system
could be  reduced by about Euro 20 bn,  which is  equivalent  to about 2% of the
total  contributions to the state  healthcare  system.  Currently,  contribution
rates  average  around 14.3%,  paid in equal parts by employers  and  employees.
Therefore  employers  would benefit most,  as their  non-wage  labor costs would
decline in line with the cut. In addition to health care  reform,  the  proposal
includes a provision  for labor  market and old-age  pension  reform.  The labor
market reform includes a major cut in unemployment benefits in order to increase
the incentive to find a job and to bring  financial  relief to the  unemployment
system. Old age pensions are expected to be cut due to demographic  developments
and a higher life expectancy.

   QUESTION:  What about the tax cuts? This seems to be last year's story.  What
is new and how will the economy benefit?

   ANSWER:  The  government  decided to bring forward the third stage of the tax
reform by one year, from 2003 to January 2004. The government estimates that the
additional  relief for  households  would come to about Euro 15 bn, and together
with the second stage of the tax reform would be equal to about Euro 22 bn. This
step is expected to be financed by higher  borrowings,  more radical cuts in tax
subsidies  for  commuters  and  homeowners  as well as  privatization  revenues.
Overall,  this step  would  improve  business  and  consumer  sentiment,  and is
expected to give some additional impulses to growth this and next year. Assuming
that the savings  ratio will rise only  slightly it is expected to add about .3%
to next year's GDP growth.

   QUESTION: Wouldn't this tax cut jeopardize the already high budget deficit in
Germany and with that exceed the 3% Maastricht deficit ceiling?

   ANSWER:  Yes,  it is likely  that  Germany's  2004  deficit  will  exceed the
Maastricht limit for the third time in a row.  However,  this is not necessarily
the government's  view. So far, if we can believe Finance  Minister  Eichel,  he
seems to be  confident  that the  Maastricht  deficit  will be back below the 3%
ceiling in 2004, provided that the economy grows by 2% next year.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTLOOK FOR THE GERMAN ECONOMY

   Recent news flow  confirms  that the German  economy is at the beginning of a
rebound.  One common  indicator for business  sentiment is the Ifo index,  which
increased  in July  from  88.8 to 89.2 and was  solely  driven  by the  business
expectations component,  which advanced for the third time in a row from 98.6 to
100.2. Another positive signal was received from the German labor market, as the
number of  unemployed  fell by 33,000 in June  after  falling  by 10,000 in May.
These numbers were contrary to market expectations, and were enough to lower the
unemployment  rate for the first  time in two  years  from  10.7% to 10.6%.  Our
assumption is that economic  growth should also receive a boost from the pending
tax reform and the low  interest  rate  environment.  The  outlook on  inflation
remains good with July's inflation number falling to .9% year on year.

   The European  Central Bank  ("ECB") kept  interest  rates on hold in July and
sent a neutral  message to the market with regards to future interest rate cuts.
However, with the refinancing rate at a low 2%, the ECB kept its monetary policy
easy enough to stimulate the Western  European  economies.  Market  participants
still expect another  interest rate cut, which seems rather unlikely in the near
term. Especially, as the ECB is going through its yearly routine of handing over
its presidency and will therefore need the subsequent months to prepare the 2004
budgets.  This could delay a potential  interest  rate cut until  December  4th.
However,  key risks to such an expectation  include a more powerful  recovery of
the European economy and a weaker Euro.

   The Euro  exchange  rate has topped out at around 1.19 against the US$ at the
end of May after  strengthening  more than 29% from a year and a half ago.  This
pause  seems  normal as  Europe's  current  account  surplus  is  narrowing  and
investment  flows into the Euro area are reversing.  Our expectation is that the
Euro will  strengthen  further against the US$, but this  appreciation  could be
delayed if a possible  recovery in the US economy gives rise to renewed  capital
outflows from Euroland.

THE GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Germany  Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated  in Delaware on April 8,
1986 as a diversified,  closed-end  management  investment  company.  Investment
operations  commenced on July 23, 1986. Pursuant to shareholder  approvals,  the
Fund  reincorporated  in Maryland on August 29, 1990 and on October 16, 1996 the
Fund changed from a diversified to a non-diversified company.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.  Assets and liabilities denominated in euros and other
foreign  currency amounts are translated into United States dollars at the 10:00
A.M.  mid-point  of the buying and  selling  spot  rates  quoted by the  Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income
and expenses are reported at the rate of exchange  prevailing on the  respective
dates of such transactions. The resultant gains and losses arising from exchange
rate  fluctuations  are  identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,
except for such amounts  attributable  to investments  which are included in net
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

During the year ended  December 31, 2002, the Fund  reclassified  permanent book
and tax differences as follows:

                                                  INCREASE
                                                 (DECREASE)
                                                 ----------
Undistributed net realized gain on investments
  and foreign currency transactions ............ $ 28,299
Paid-in capital ................................  (28,299)

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
        ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

The Fund has a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager"),  and an Investment Advisory Agreement with Deutsche Asset Management
International  GmbH (the "Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the Investment
Adviser are affiliated companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $50 million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $50 million. The
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides  the  Investment  Adviser  with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100 million.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser, in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objectives,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders,  and selects  brokers and dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions on
behalf of the Fund.


NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
For the six months ended June 30, 2003,  Deutsche  Bank AG, the German parent of
the Manager and  Investment  Adviser,  and its  affiliates  received  $47,717 in
brokerage  commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio
securities on behalf of the Fund.

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for the six  months  ended June 30,  2003 were  $105,191,910  and  $106,458,957,
respectively.

The cost of investments at December 31, 2002 was  $97,683,090  for United States
Federal  income  tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  as  of  December  31,  2002,  net
unrealized  depreciation  of  investments  aggregated   $13,509,018,   of  which
$2,289,327 and $15,798,345 related to unrealized  appreciation and depreciation,
respectively.

During the period  November  1, 2002 to December  31,  2002,  the Fund  incurred
capital  losses of  $1,469,860.  This loss was deferred  for federal  income tax
purposes to January 1, 2003.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward at December  31, 2002 of  approximately  $58.2  million,  of which $26.5
million and $31.7 million will expire in 2009 and 2010, respectively. No capital
gains distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders until future net gains
have been realized in excess of such carry forward.


NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED
At June 30, 2003,  the market  values of the  securities  loaned and  government
securities received as collateral for such loans were $6,358,929 and $6,749,788,

   ++ Total investment return based on market value is calculated assuming that
      shares of the Fund's common stock were purchased at the closing market
      price as of the beginning of the year, dividends, capital gains and other
      distributions were reinvested as provided for in the Fund's dividend
      reinvestment plan and then sold at the closing market price per share on
      the last day of the year. The computation does not reflect any sales
      commission investors may incur in purchasing or selling shares of the
      Fund. The total investment return based on the net asset value is
      similarly computed except that the Fund's net asset value is substituted
      for the closing market price.

    * The custody credits are attributable to interest earned on U.S. cash
      balances. The ratio of total expenses after custody credits to average net
      assets are 2.03%, 1.63%, 1.46%, 1.27%, 1.25% and 1.15% for 2003, 2002,
      2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

   ** Annualized.
  *** Not Annualized.
 **** Not Annualized. The ratio for six months ended June 30, 2003 has not been
      annualized since the Fund believes it would not be appropriate because the
      Fund's dividend income is not earned ratably throughout the fiscal year.
