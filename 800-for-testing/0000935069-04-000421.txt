ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

The India Fund, Inc.

                                                               February 19, 2004


DEAR FUND SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to present you with the audited financial statements of The India
Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2003.

The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") closed at $23.76 on December 31, 2003,
representing an increase of 87.64% from the Fund's NAV on 12/31/02. The Fund
outperformed its benchmark, the IFC Investable Index, which gained 81.55% for
the same 12-month fiscal year.*

The Indian stock market was one of the top performers in Asia, with robust
economic growth, excess global liquidity, and relatively attractive share
valuations all contributing. In addition, India continues to benefit from the
global outsourcing trend, which is turning the country into a viable part of
multinationals' supply chain network. As reported, Indian foreign exchange
reserves passed $100 billion in 2003 for the first time.** The Indian economy's
strength was also driven by ongoing domestic structural reforms, including a
renewed commitment to deregulation, and privatization.

Looking ahead, we believe India still faces a number of challenges, including an
economy with an enormous fiscal deficit, red tape, and poor infrastructure. As
reported, national elections are scheduled for April 2004, and this will present
uncertainty.** Finally, following 2003's impressive rally, we believe valuations
are not as compelling as they were one year ago. Nevertheless, we strongly
believe that the fundamental long-term outlook for India remains positive.


                                                                               1

continued support of the Fund. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate

Sincerely,

/s/  BRYAN McKIGNEY

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE IN INVESTMENT POLICY
On April 30, 2002,  the Board of Directors of the Fund  approved a change to the
Fund's  investment  policies  in  connection  with  new  Rule  35d-1  under  the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Under normal conditions, the Fund will invest at
least 80% of the value of its assets in equity  securities  of Indian  Companies
(as  defined  in the  Fund's  prospectus.)  Previously,  the  Fund's  investment
policies  stated  that the Fund  would  invest  at least 65% of the value of its
assets in such  securities.  The Board  also  adopted  a policy to  provide  the
stockholders  of the Fund with 60 days'  notice of any change to the  investment
policy adopted if such notice is required by Rule 35d-1.

FUNDAMENTAL PERIODIC REPURCHASE POLICY
The Fund  has  adopted  the  following  fundamental  policy  regarding  periodic
repurchases:
   a) The Fund  will  make  offers  to  repurchase  its  shares  at  semi-annual
      intervals pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
      as amended from time to time ("Offers").  The Board of Directors may place
      such  conditions and  limitations on Offers as may be permitted under Rule
      23c-3.
   b) 14 days  prior to the last  Friday of the  Fund's  first and third  fiscal
      quarters,  or the next  business day if such Friday is not a business day,
      will be the deadline (the "Repurchase Request Deadline") by which the Fund
      must receive repurchase  requests submitted by stockholders in response to
      the most recent Offer.
   c) The date on which the repurchase price for shares is to be determined (the
      "Repurchase  Pricing  Date")  shall occur no later than the last Friday of
      the Fund's first and third fiscal  quarters,  or the next  business day if
      such day is not a business day.
   d) Offers may be suspended  or  postponed  under  certain  circumstances,  as
      provided for in Rule 23c-3.

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Notes to Financial Statements                                  DECEMBER 31, 2003


NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The India Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on December 27,
1993, and commenced operations on February 23, 1994. The Fund operates through a
branch in the Republic of Mauritius. The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940,  as amended,  as a closed-end,  non-diversified  management
investment company.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

PORTFOLIO  VALUATION.  Investments  are  stated  at  value  in the  accompanying
financial  statements.  All securities  for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at:

     (i)    the last sales  price prior to the time of  determination,  if there
            was a sale on the date of determination,

     (ii)   at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices,  if there
            was no sales  price on such  date and bid and asked  quotations  are
            available, and

     (iii)  at the bid price if there  was no sales  price on such date and only
            bid quotations are available.

Securities  that  are  traded  over-the-counter  are  valued,  if bid and  asked
quotations are available,  at the mean between the current bid and asked prices.
Securities for which sales prices and bid and asked quotations are not available
on the date of determination may be valued at the most recently available prices
or quotations under policies  adopted by the Board of Directors.  Investments in
short-term  debt  securities  having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized  cost which  approximates  market value.  Securities  for which market
values are not  readily  ascertainable,  which  totaled  $111,452  (0.02% of net
assets) at December 31, 2003,  are carried at fair value as  determined  in good
faith by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors. The net asset value
per share of the Fund is calculated weekly and at the end of each month.

INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME.  Investment  transactions  are
accounted for on the trade date. The cost of  investments  sold is determined by
use of the  specific  identification  method for both  financial  reporting  and
income tax reporting purposes. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis;
dividend  income  is  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date or,  using  reasonable
diligence,  when known.  The  collectibility  of income  receivable  from Indian
securities  is  evaluated   periodically,   and  any  resulting  allowances  for
uncollectible amounts are reflected currently in the determination of investment
income.

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                      DECEMBER 31, 2003


TAX STATUS.  No provision is made for U.S.  federal income or excise taxes as it
is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to  make  the  requisite  distributions  to its  shareholders  that  will be
sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all Federal income and excise
taxes.

Income and capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2003:

Ordinary income ...............................................   $   3,046,584
                                                                  =============

At December 31, 2003, the components of net assets  (excluding  paid in capital)
on a tax basis were as follows:

Overdistribution of Ordinary Income ............  $    (214,070)
Plus/Less: Cumulative Timing Differences .......        (44,129)
                                                  -------------
Overdistribution of net investment income .....................   $    (258,199)
                                                                  -------------
Tax basis capital loss carryover ...............  $ (42,954,175)
Plus/Less: Cumulative Timing Differences .......     (1,405,122)
                                                  -------------
Accumulated net realized loss on investments ..................     (44,359,297)
                                                                  -------------
Book unrealized foreign exchange loss .........................         (98,491)
                                                                  -------------
Tax unrealized appreciation ....................  $ 286,760,632
Plus/Less: Cumulative Timing Differences .......      1,405,122
                                                  -------------
Unrealized appreciation .......................................     288,165,754
                                                                  -------------
Net assets (excluding paid in capital) ........................   $ 243,449,767
                                                                  =============

The differences between book and tax basis unrealized  appreciation is primarily
attributable  to wash  sales and a  dividend  overdistribution.  The  cumulative
timing difference for the capital loss carryover is due to Post October Losses.

Net Asset Value ...............................................   $ 556,811,341
Paid in Capital ...............................................    (313,361,574)
                                                                  -------------
Net assets (excluding paid in capital) ........................   $ 243,449,767
                                                                  =============


                                                                              17

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                      DECEMBER 31, 2003


At December 31, 2003, the Fund had a capital loss carryover of $42,954,175 which
is available to offset future net realized gains on securities  transactions  to
the extent provided for in the Internal  Revenue Code. Of the aggregate  capital
losses,  $11,095,634  will expire in 2006,  $20,935,877  will expire in 2009 and
$10,922,664  will expire in 2010.  During the year ended  December 31, 2003, the
Fund utilized $33,704,004 of prior year capital loss carryforwards.

The Fund's realized foreign exchange losses incurred after October 31, 2003, but
before  December 31, 2003,  are deemed to arise on the first business day of the
following  year.  The Fund incurred and elected to defer such  realized  foreign
exchange losses of $44,129.

During the period ended December 31, 2003, the Fund  reclassified  $183,331 from
accumulated  net  realized  loss  on  investments  to  overdistribution  of  net
investment  income as a result of permanent  book and tax  differences  relating
primarily to realized  foreign  currency  gains.  Net investment  income and net
assets were not affected by the reclassifications.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S.  dollars.  Foreign  currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (i)   market value of investment securities,  assets and liabilities at the
           prevailing rates of exchange on the valuation date; and

     (ii)  purchases and sales of investment securities and investment income at
           the relevant rates of exchange  prevailing on the respective dates of
           such transactions.

The Fund  generally  does not  isolate  the  effect of  fluctuations  in foreign
exchange  rates  from  the  effect  of  fluctuations  in the  market  prices  of
securities. However, the Fund does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency  rates  when  determining  the gain or loss  upon  the sale of  foreign
currency  denominated  debt  obligations  pursuant  to U.S.  Federal  income tax
regulations;  such amounts are  categorized as foreign  currency gains or losses
for federal  income tax  purposes.  The Fund reports  certain  realized  foreign
exchange  gains and  losses as  components  of  realized  gains and  losses  for
financial  reporting  purposes,  whereas  such  amounts  are treated as ordinary
income for Federal income tax reporting purposes.

Securities  denominated  in  currencies  other than U.S.  dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign  exchange.  Foreign security and
currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of domestic  origin as a result of, among other  factors,
the level of  governmental  supervision  and  regulation  of foreign  securities
markets and the possibility of political or economic  instability,  and the fact
that foreign  securities markets may be smaller and have less developed and less
reliable settlement and share registration procedures.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                      DECEMBER 31, 2003


DISTRIBUTION  OF INCOME AND GAINS.  The Fund intends to  distribute  annually to
shareholders,  substantially all of its net investment income, including foreign
currency  gains,  and to  distribute  annually any net realized  gains after the
utilization of available capital loss carryovers. An additional distribution may
be made to the extent necessary to avoid payment of a 4% Federal excise tax.

Distributions to shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date. The amount
of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized gains
are  determined in accordance  with Federal  income tax  regulations,  which may
differ from  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of
America.  These  "book/tax"  differences  are  either  considered  temporary  or
permanent in nature.  To the extent these  differences  are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their Federal
tax-basis  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not require  reclassification.
Dividends and distributions  which exceed net investment income and net realized
capital  gains for  financial  reporting  purposes  but not for tax purposes are
reported  as  dividends  in excess of net  investment  income  and net  realized
capital gains. To the extent they exceed net investment  income and net realized
gains for tax purposes, they are reported as distributions of additional paid-in
capital.

amended (the "1940 Act"),  the Fund's  then-existing  Management  Agreement  and
Country Advisory Agreement provided for their automatic termination in the event
of  their  "assignment"  as  defined  in  the  1940  Act.  Consummation  of  the
acquisition  by Fahnestock and FVH of the asset  management  business of CIBC WM
constituted an assignment of the Fund's then existing  Management  Agreement and
Country  Advisory  Agreement.  At a meeting on January  17,  2003,  the Board of
Directors  of the Fund,  including  a  majority  of the  independent  Directors,
approved a new investment  management  agreement  between the Fund and Advantage
and a new  Country  Advisory  Agreement  between  Advantage  and  Imperial.  The
acquisition by Fahnestock and FVH of CIBC WM's U.S.  asset  management  business
was completed on June 4, 2003. In connection with the June 4, 2003  acquisition,

4, 2003 was executed,  having been previously approved by the Board of Directors
of the Fund,  including a majority  of the  independent  Directors  at a special
meeting  held on January  17,  2003 and by the  stockholders  of the Fund at the
Fund's April 23, 2003 annual  meeting of  stockholders,  as required by the 1940

Inc.

affiliate  thereof  an annual  fee of $5,000  plus up to $700 for each  Board of
Directors meeting attended.  In addition,  the Fund reimburses all directors for

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                      DECEMBER 31, 2003


NOTE D: FOREIGN INCOME TAX

The Fund  conducts  its  investment  activities  in India as a tax  resident  of
Mauritius  and  expects  to obtain  benefits  under the double  taxation  treaty
between  Mauritius and India (the "tax treaty" or "treaty").  To obtain benefits
under  the  double  taxation  treaty,  the Fund  must  meet  certain  tests  and
conditions,  including the  establishment of Mauritius tax residence and related
requirements. The Fund has obtained a certificate from the Mauritian authorities
that it is a resident of  Mauritius  under the double  taxation  treaty  between
Mauritius and India. Under current  regulations,  a fund which is a tax resident
in Mauritius under the treaty,  but has no branch or permanent  establishment in
India,  will  not be  subject  to  capital  gains  tax in  India  on the sale of
securities  but is  subject  to a 15%  withholding  tax on  dividends  declared,
distributed  or paid by an Indian  company prior to June 1, 1997 and after March
31, 2002.  During the period June 1, 1997 through March 31, 2002, and subsequent
to March 31,  2003,  dividend  income from  domestic  companies  was exempt from
Indian  income tax.  For the period from April 1, 2002  through  March 31, 2003,
dividend income from domestic  companies was subject to a 15%  withholding  tax.
Effective April 1, 2003,  dividend income from domestic companies is exempt from
Indian  tax.  The Fund is  subject  to and  accrues  Indian  withholding  tax on
interest  earned on Indian  securities at the rate of 20.5%  effective  April 1,
2003,  21%  between  April 1, 2002 and April 1, 2003,  and 20% prior to April 1,
2002.

The  Fund  will,  in any year  that it has  taxable  income  for  Mauritius  tax
purposes,  elect to pay tax on its net income for  Mauritius tax purposes at any
rate between 0% and 35%.

In March 2000,  the Indian tax  authorities  issued an assessment  order ("March
2000  Assessment  Order")  with respect to the Fund's  Indian  income tax return
filed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 which  denied the benefits of the
tax treaty between India and Mauritius.  In the March 2000 Assessment Order, the
Indian tax  authorities  held that the Fund is not a resident of  Mauritius  and
assessed  tax on the  dividend  income for the year ended  March 31, 1997 at the
rate of 20%,  instead  of the 15% rate  claimed by the Fund under the tax treaty
between India and Mauritius.  Similar  assessment  orders were issued to several
other  mutual  fund  companies  relying  on the tax  treaty  between  India  and
Mauritius.  On April 13, 2000, the Central Board of Direct Taxes ("CBDT") of the
Ministry of Finance in India issued a circular ("Circular 789") "clarifying" its
position on Indian  taxation  under the tax treaty  between  India and Mauritius
that,   wherever  a  certificate   of  residence  is  issued  by  the  Mauritian
authorities,  such certificate will constitute sufficient evidence for accepting
the status of residence  as well as  beneficial  ownership  for applying the tax
treaty  between India and  Mauritius.  The Fund,  relying on Circular 789 and in
absence of a  rectification  order from the assessing  officer,  filed an appeal
against the March 2000 Assessment Order with the Indian tax  authorities.  There
have been several  hearings and the Fund is awaiting an appellate  judgment.  On
October 7, 2003,  the Indian  Supreme  Court upheld  Circular 789 and the Fund's
right to take advantage of the tax treaty between India and Mauritius.


                                                                              21

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                      DECEMBER 31, 2003


The Fund  continues  to:  (i)  comply  with the  requirements  of the tax treaty
between  India and  Mauritius;  (ii) be a tax resident of  Mauritius;  and (iii)
maintain  that its central  management  and  control  resides in  Mauritius  and
therefore  management believes that the Fund will be able to obtain the benefits
of the tax treaty  between India and  Mauritius.  Accordingly,  no provision for
Indian income taxes has been made in  accompanying  financial  statements of the
Fund. Although the Fund expects to obtain the benefits of the treaty for the tax
year ended  March 31,  1997,  the Fund has not yet  received  notification  of a
repeal of the assessment order issued.

The foregoing is based upon current  interpretation  and practice and is subject
to future  changes in Indian or  Mauritian  tax laws and in the  treaty  between
India and Mauritius.

NOTE E: CAPITAL STOCK

During the year ended  December 31, 2002,  the Fund  purchased  89,000 shares of
capital  stock on the open  market at a total  cost of  $920,118.  The  weighted
average  discount of these  purchases,  comparing the purchase  price to the net
asset value at the time of purchase,  was 17.29%.  These  shares were  purchased
pursuant to the Fund's Stock  Repurchase Plan previously  approved by the Fund's
Board of Directors  authorizing  the Fund to purchase up to 4,000,000  shares of
its  capital  stock on the open  market.  At a meeting  of the  Fund's  Board of
Directors  held May 8, 2003,  the Board  suspended  the Fund's Stock  Repurchase
Plan.

At a meeting of the Board of Directors  held on January 29,  2002,  the Board of
Directors  approved  a tender  offer.  Pursuant  to the tender  offer,  the Fund
offered to purchase up to 10% of the Fund's  outstanding  shares of common stock
for cash at a price  equal to 95% of the Fund's net asset  value per share as of
the closing date.  The tender offer  commenced on August 30, 2002 and expired on
September  27, 2002. In connection  with the tender  offer,  the Fund  purchased
3,063,433  shares of  capital  stock at a total cost of  $33,375,712,  including
expenses of $168,098.

In  February  2003,  the Board of  Directors  approved,  subject to  stockholder
approval,  a fundamental  policy whereby the Fund would adopt an "interval fund"
structure  pursuant  to Rule 23c-3  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940.
Stockholders  of the Fund were to approve  the  policy at the Annual  Meeting of
Stockholders  held on April 23, 2003,  however the proposal  was  adjourned  and
later  approved  on  April  30,  2003.  As an  interval  fund,  the  Fund  makes
semi-annual  repurchase  offers at net asset value (less a 2% repurchase fee) to
all Fund  stockholders.  The percentage of outstanding  shares that the Fund can
repurchase in each offer is established by the Fund's Board of Directors shortly
before the commencement of each semi-annual  offer, and is between 5% and 25% of
the Fund's then-outstanding shares.

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)                      DECEMBER 31, 2003


During the year ended  December 31, 2003,  the Fund  completed  one  semi-annual
repurchase  offer.  On August 22, 2003, the Fund offered to repurchase up to 15%
of its issued and  outstanding  shares of common  stock.  The  repurchase  offer
expired on September 12, 2003, and the shares were repurchased at the NAV at the
close of regular  trading on the New York Stock  Exchange on September 26, 2003,
less a repurchase fee of 2% of the NAV per share. Prior to the expiration of the
Fund's  repurchase offer,  17,530,127.5345  shares were validly tendered and not
withdrawn.  The final pro-ration calculations resulted in 139,149 odd lot shares
and 3,996,486 non-odd lot shares validly  tendered.  Under the final pro-ration,
22.97983% of the non-odd lot shares  tendered  were  accepted  for payment.  The
shares accepted for tender (4,135,635 shares  representing 15%) received cash at
a repurchase  offer price of  $17.2872,  which was equal to the Fund's net asset
value of $17.64 as of September 26, 2003,  less a repurchase  fee of $0.3528 per
share,  for a total cost to the Fund of  $71,597,216,  net of repurchase  fee of
$1,459,052, and including expenses of $103,667.

NOTE F: CONCENTRATION OF RISKS

At December 31, 2003,  substantially  all of the Fund's net assets were invested
in Indian  securities.  The Indian  securities  markets are among  other  things
substantially  smaller, less developed,  less liquid, subject to less regulation
and  more  volatile  than  the   securities   markets  in  the  United   States.
Consequently,  and as further discussed above,  acquisitions and dispositions of
securities by the Fund involve special risks and considerations not present with
respect to U.S.  securities.  At December 31, 2003, the Fund has a concentration
of its investment in computer,  finance,  and petroleum related industries.  The
values of such investments may be affected by changes in such industry sectors.

NOTE G: OTHER

On October 29, 2003, the Board of Directors  elected Lawrence K. Becker to serve
as a  non-interested  Director and as a member of the Fund's Audit Committee and
to function as the Audit Committee's "financial expert" for purposes of the U.S.
securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.


                                                                              23

Report of Independent Auditors

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
THE INDIA FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the financial position of The India Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
at December 31, 2003, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial  statements") are the  responsibility of the Fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  of these  financial  statements  in
accordance with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United States of
America,  which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2003 by
correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provide a reasonable  basis for
our opinion.

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Dividends and Distributions

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund intends to distribute annually to shareholders substantially all of its
net investment income, and to distribute any net realized capital gains at least
annually.  Net  investment  income  for this  purpose  is income  other than net
realized long and short-term capital gains net of expenses.

Pursuant to the  Dividend  Reinvestment  and Cash  Purchase  Plan (the  "Plan"),
shareholders whose shares of Common Stock are registered in their own names will
be deemed to have elected to have all distributions  automatically reinvested by
the Plan Agent in Fund  shares  pursuant to the Plan,  unless such  shareholders
elect to  receive  distributions  in cash.  Shareholders  who  elect to  receive
distributions  in cash will receive all  distributions  in cash paid by check in
dollars mailed  directly to the shareholder by the dividend paying agent. In the
case of shareholders  such as banks,  brokers or nominees,  that hold shares for
others who are beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the
basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the shareholders as
representing the total amount  registered in such  shareholders'  names and held
for  the  account  of  beneficial  owners  that  have  not  elected  to  receive
distributions  in cash.  Investors  that own shares  registered in the name of a
bank,   broker  or  other  nominee  should  consult  with  such  nominee  as  to
participation  in the Plan  through  such  nominee,  and may be required to have
their shares registered in their own names in order to participate in the Plan.

The Plan Agent serves as agent for the shareholders in  administering  the Plan.
If the  directors  of the Fund  declare an income  dividend  or a capital  gains
distribution   payable   either  in  the  Fund's   Common   Stock  or  in  cash,
nonparticipants  in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund or purchased by the Plan Agent in
the open  market,  as  provided  below.  If the  market  price  per share on the
valuation  date equals or exceeds  net asset  value per share on that date,  the
Fund  will  issue new  shares to  participants  at net  asset  value;  provided,
however,  that if the net asset  value is less than 95% of the  market  price on
valuation date, then such shares will be issued at 95% of the market price.  The
valuation  date will be the  dividend or  distribution  payment date or, if that
date is not a New York Stock Exchange  trading day, the next  preceding  trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time, or
if the Fund  should  declare an income  dividend or capital  gains  distribution
payable only in cash,  the Plan Agent will, as agent for the  participants,  buy
Fund shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for
the  participants'  accounts on, or shortly after,  the payment date. if, before
the Plan Agent has  completed  its  purchases,  the market price exceeds the net
asset value of a Fund share,  the average per share  purchase  price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisition  of fewer  shares than if the  distribution  had been paid in shares
issued by the Fund on the dividend payment date.

Dividends and Distributions (continued)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

Because of the forgoing  difficulty with respect to open market  purchases,  the
Plan  provides  that if the Plan  Agent is unable to  invest  the full  dividend
amount in open  market  purchases  during the  purchase  period or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase  period,  the Plan Agent
will cease  making  open-market  purchases  and  shareholders  will  receive the
uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at the close of
business on the last purchase date.

Participants  have the option of making  additional  cash  payments  to the Plan
Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for investment in the Fund's
Common Stock. The Plan Agent will use all such funds received from  participants
to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about February 15.

Any voluntary cash payment received more than 30 days prior to this date will be
returned by the Plan Agent, and interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
payment. To avoid unnecessary cash  accumulations,  and also to allow ample time
for receipt and processing by the Plan Agent, it is suggested that  participants
send in voluntary  cash payments to be received by the Plan Agent  approximately
ten days before an applicable  purchase date specified  above. A participant may
withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written  notice,  if the notice is received
by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Agent  maintains  all  shareholder  accounts in the Plan and  furnishes
written  confirmations of all transactions in an account,  including information
needed by  shareholders  for personal and tax records.  Shares in the account of
each  Plan  participant  will be  held  by the  Plan  Agent  in the  name of the
participant,  and each  shareholder's  proxy will include those shares purchased
pursuant to the Plan.

There is no charge to participants  for  reinvesting  dividends or capital gains
distributions  or  voluntary  cash  payments.  The  Plan  Agent's  fees  for the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments  will be paid by the Fund.  There  will be no  brokerage  charges  with
respect  to  shares  issued  directly  by the Fund as a result of  dividends  or
capital gains distributions  payable either in stock or in cash.  However,  each
participant  will pay a pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred  with
respect  to the Plan  Agent's  open  market  purchases  in  connection  with the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments made by the participant. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts
of stock for individual  accounts  through the Plan are expected to be less than
the usual brokerage charges for such  transactions,  because the Plan Agent will
be  purchasing  stock for all  participants  in blocks and  prorating  the lower
commissions thus attainable.


                                                                              29

Dividends and Distributions (concluded)

The  receipt of  dividends  and  distributions  under the Plan will not  relieve
participants  of any  income  tax  that  may be  payable  on such  dividends  or
distributions.

Experience  under the Plan may indicate that changes in the Plan are  desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan
as applied to any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent  to notice of the  termination  sent to  members of the Plan at
least 30 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended by the Fund or the Plan Agent, but (except when necessary or
appropriate  to comply with  applicable  law,  rules or policies of a regulatory
authority) only by at least 30 days' written notice to participants in the Plan.
All  correspondence  concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
P.O. Box 43027, Westborough, Massachusetts 43027.

                                  INTRODUCTION
                                  ------------



Rule 206(4)-6 (the "Rule") adopted under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the "Advisers Act") requires all registered investment advisers that
exercise voting discretion over securities held in client portfolios to adopt
proxy voting policies and procedures.

Advantage Advisers, Inc., (the "Adviser") is a registered investment adviser
under the Advisers Act and is therefore required to adopt proxy voting policies
and procedures pursuant to the Rule.

When the Adviser has investment discretion over a client's investment portfolio,
then the Adviser votes proxies for the Account pursuant to the policies and
procedures set forth herein.













                                                                               5

                           VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES
                           ---------------------------
                            IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS
                            ------------------------

                                        -
These proposals seek shareholder votes for persons who have been nominated by a
corporation's board of directors to stand for election to serve as members of
that board. No candidates are opposing these board nominees.

In each analysis of an uncontested election of directors you should review:
     a) Company performance
     b) Composition of the board and key board committees
     c) Attendance at board meetings
     d) Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity

We may also consider:
     a) Board decisions concerning executive compensation
     b) Number of other board seats held by the nominee
     c) Interlocking directorships


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                           It is our policy to vote IN FAVOR of
                                           the candidates proposed by the board.

We will look carefully at each candidate's background contained in the proxy
statement. In the absence of unusual circumstances suggesting a nominee is
clearly not qualified to serve as a member of the board, we will vote with
management.








                                                                               6

CHAIRMAN AND CEO ARE THE SAME PERSON
- ------------------------------------

     Shareholders may propose that different persons hold the positions of the
     chairman and the CEO.

     We would evaluate these proposals on a case by case basis depending on the
     size of the company and performance of management.






















                                                                               7

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
- -------------------------

     Shareholders may request that the board be comprised of a majority of
     independent directors and that audit, compensation and nominating
     committees of the Board consists exclusively of independent directors. We
     believe that independent directors are important to corporate governance.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                     It is our policy to vote
                                                     FOR proposals requesting
                                                     that a majority of the
                                                     Board be independent and
                                                     that the audit,
                                                     compensation and nominating
                                                     committees of the board
                                                     include only independent
                                                     directors.


















                                                                               8

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
- ----------------------------

         Shareholders may propose that directors be required to own a minimum
amount of company stock or that directors should be paid in company stock, not
cash. This proposal is based on the view that directors will align themselves
with the interest of shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. We
believe that directors are required to exercise their fiduciary duty to the
company and its shareholders whether or not they own shares in the company and
should be allowed to invest in company stock based on their own personal
considerations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                Vote AGAINST proposals that
                                                require director stock ownership



















                                                                               9

                            CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
                            ------------------------

         Charitable contributions by companies are generally useful for
         assisting worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill between the
         company and its community. Moreover, there may be certain long-term
         financial benefits to companies from certain charitable contributions
         generated from, for example, movies spent helping educational efforts
         in the firm's primary employment areas. Shareholders should not decide
         what the most worthwhile charities are.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                (Shareholders Proposals)
                                                Vote AGAINST proposals regarding
                                                charitable contribution.

         Shareholders have differing and equally sincere views as to which
         charities the company should contribute to, and the amount it should
         contribute. In the absence of bad faith, self-dealing, or gross
         negligence, management should determine which contributions are in the
         best interest of the company.










                                                                              10

                      DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION
                      ------------------------------------
                            AND LIABILITY PROTECTION
                            ------------------------

         These proposals typically provide for protection (or additional
         protection) which is to be afforded to the directors of a corporation
         in the form of indemnification by the corporation, insurance coverage
         or limitations upon their liability in connection with their
         responsibilities as directors.

         When a corporation indemnifies its directors and officers, it means the
         corporation promises to reimburse them for certain legal expenses,
         damages, and judgements incurred as a result of lawsuits relating to
         their corporate actions. The corporation becomes the insurer for its
         officers and directors.












                                                                              11

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                             Vote AGAINST proposals that
                                             eliminate entirely director and
                                             officers' liability for monetary
                                             damages for violating the duty
                                             of care.

                                             Vote AGAINST indemnification
                                             proposals that would expand
                                             coverage beyond just legal expenses
                                             to acts, such as negligence, that
                                             are more serious violations of
                                             fiduciary obligations than mere
                                             carelessness.

                                             Vote FOR only those proposals
                                             providing such expanded coverage in
                                             cases when a director's or
                                             officer's legal defense was
                                             unsuccessful if: a) the director
                                             was found to have acted in good
                                             faith, and b) only if the
                                             director's legal expenses would be
                                             covered.

          The following factors should be considered:

               1.   The present environment in which directors operate provides
                    substantial risk of claims or suits against against them in
                    their individual capacities arising out of the discharge of
                    their duties.

               2.   Attracting and retaining the most qualified directors
                       enhances shareholder value.



                                                                              12

                                SIZE OF THE BOARD
                                -----------------

      Typically there are three reasons for changing the size of the board.
      The first reason may be to permit inclusion into the board of
      additional individuals who, by virtue of their ability and experience,
      would benefit the corporation. The second reason may be to reduce the
      size of the board due to expiration of terms, resignation of sitting
      directors or, thirdly, to accommodate the corporation's changing needs.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                       Vote FOR the board's recommendation
                                       to increase or decrease the size of
                                       the board.

The following factors should be considered:

      1. These proposals may aim at reducing or increasing the influence of
         certain groups of individuals.

      2. This is an issue with which the board of directors is uniquely
         qualified to deal, since they have the most experience in sitting
         on a board and are up-to-date on the specific needs of the corporation.












                                                                              13

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS
- --------------------------------------------------

Votes in contested elections of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.
The following factors are considered:

     1. management's track record
     2. background to the proxy contest
     3. qualifications of director nominees













                                                                              14

                                 TERM OF OFFICE
                                 --------------

This is a shareholder's proposal to limit the tenure of outside directors. This
requirement may not be an appropriate one. It is an artificial imposition on the
board, and may have the result of removing knowledgeable directors from the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote AGAINST shareholder
                                             proposals to limit the tenure of
                                             outside directors.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   An experienced director should not be disqualified because he or she
     has served a certain number of years.

     2.   The nominating committee is in the best position to judge the
     directors' terms in office due to their understanding of a corporation's
     needs and a director's abilities and experience.

     3.   If shareholders are not satisfied with the job a director is doing,
     they can vote him/her off the board when the term is up.













                                                                              15

                             COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE
                             -----------------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval of a request that the board of
directors disclose the amount of compensation paid to officers and employees, in
addition to the disclosure of such information in the proxy statement as
required by the SEC regulations.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             (shareholders policy)
                                             Vote AGAINST these proposals that
                                             require disclosure, unless we have
                                             reason to believe that mandated
                                             disclosures are insufficient to
                                             give an accurate and meaningful
                                             account of senior management
                                             compensation.


The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Federal securities laws require disclosure in corporate proxy
     statements of the compensation paid to corporate directors and officers.

     2.   Employees other than executive officers and directors are typically
     not in policy-making roles where they have the ability to determine, in a
     significant way, the amount of their own compensation.

     3.   The disclosure of compensation of lower-level officers and employees
     infringes upon their privacy and might create morale problems.








                                                                              16

RATIFYING AUDITORS

Shareholders must make certain that auditors are responsibly examining the
financial statements of a company, that their reports adequately express any
legitimate financial concerns, and that the auditor is independent of the
company it is serving.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                           Vote FOR proposal to ratify auditors.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. Although lawsuits are sometimes filed against accounting firms,
         including those nationally recognized, these firms typically complete
         their assignments in a lawful and professional manner.

         2. Sometimes it may be appropriate for a corporation to change
         accounting firms, but the board of directors is in the best position to
         judge the advantages of any such change and any disagreements with
         former auditors must be fully disclosed to shareholders.

         3. If there is a reason to believe the independent auditor has rendered
         an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
         financial position, then in this case vote AGAINST ratification.







                                                                              18

                                  POISON PILLS
                                  ------------


Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by
potential acquirers, do one or more of the following: a) dilute the acquirer's
equity in the target company, b) dilute the acquirer's voting interests in the
target company, or c) dilute the acquirer's equity holdings in the post-merger
company. Generally, poison pills accomplish these tasks by issuing rights or
warrants to shareholders that are essentially worthless unless triggered by a
hostile acquisition attempt.

A poison pill should contain a redemption clause that would allow the board to
redeem it even after a potential acquirer has surpassed the ownership threshold.
Poison pills may be adopted by the board without shareholder approval. But
shareholders must have the opportunity to ratify or reject them at least every
two years.

                                    GREENMAIL
                                    ---------

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the
market, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Greenmail payments usually expose the company to negative press and may result
in lawsuits by shareholders. When a company's name is associated with such a
practice, company customers may think twice about future purchases made at the
expense of the shareholders.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote FOR proposals to adopt anti
                                             Greenmail or bylaw amendments or
                                             otherwise restrict a company's
                                             ability to make Greenmail payments

                                             Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis
                                             regarding anti-Greenmail proposals
                                             when they are bundled with other
                                             charter or bylaw amendments.

The following factors should be considered:

          1. While studies by the SEC and others show that Greenmail devalues
          the company's stock price, an argument can be made that a payment can
          enable the company to pursue plans that may provide long-term gains to
          the shareholders.

                               ------------------

Supermajority provisions violate the principle that a simple majority of voting
shares should be all that is necessary to effect change regarding a company and
its corporate governance provisions. These proposals seek shareholder approval
to exceed the normal level of shareholder participation and approval from a
simple majority of the outstanding shares to a much higher percentage.


VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                             Vote AGAINST management proposals
                                             to require a Supermajority
                                             shareholder vote to approve mergers
                                             and other significant business
                                             combinations.

                                             Vote FOR shareholder proposals to
                                             lower Supermajority vote
                                             requirements for mergers and other
                                             significant business combinations.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Supermajority requirements ensure broad agreement on issues that may
     have a significant impact on the future of the company.

     2.   Supermajority vote may make action all but impossible.

     3.   Supermajority requirements are counter to the principle of majority
     rule.

                             CHANGING CORPORATE NAME
                             -----------------------

This proposal seeks shareholder approval to change the corporation's name. It is
probably better to vote for the proposed name change before management goes back
to the drawing board and spends another small fortune attempting again to change
the name.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote FOR changing the corporate
                                             name.

The following factors should be considered:

         1. A name of a corporation symbolizes its substance.

         2. There are many reasons a corporation may have for changing its name,
         including an intention to change the direction of the business or to
         have a contemporary corporate image.

         3. The board of directors is well-positioned to determine the best name
         for the corporation because, among other reasons, it usually seeks
         professional advice on such matters.

















                                                                              24

                                 ---------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to change the state in which a company
is incorporated. Sometimes this is done to accommodate the company's most active
operations or headquarters. More often, however, the companies want to
reincorporate in a state with more stringent anti-takeover provisions.
Delaware's state laws, for instance, including liability and anti-takeover
provisions, are more favorable to corporations.



VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis,
                                             carefully reviewing the new state's
                                             laws and any significant changes
                                             the company makes in its charter
                                             and by-laws.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   The board is in the best position to determine the company's need to
          incorporate.

     2.   Reincorporation may have considerable implications for shareholders,
          affecting a company's takeover defenses, its corporate structure or
          governance features.

     3.   Reincorporation in a state with stronger anti-takeover laws may harm
          shareholder value.

                 BOARD STRUCTURE: STAGGERED VS. ANNUAL ELECTIONS
                 -----------------------------------------------

A company that has classified, or staggered, board is one in which directors are
typically divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year terms;
each class's reelection occurs in different years. In contrast, all directors of
an annually elected board serve one-year and the entire board stands for
election each year.

Classifying the board makes it more difficult to change control of a company
through a proxy contest involving election of directors. Because only a minority
of the directors are elected each year, it will be more difficult to win control
of the board in a single election.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                             Vote AGAINST proposals to classify
                                             the board. Vote FOR proposals to
                                             repeal classified boards and to
                                             elect all directors annually.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   The annual election of directors provides an extra check on
          management's performance. A director who is doing a good job should
          not fear an annual review of his/her directorship.













                                                                              27

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING
                                -----------------

Most companies provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each
share owned, the so-called "one share, one vote" standard. This proposal seeks
to allow each shareholder to cast votes in the election of directors
proportionate to the number of directors times the number of shares owned by
each shareholder for one nominee.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote AGAINST proposals that permit
                                             cumulative voting.


The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Cumulative voting would allow a minority owner to create an impact
          disproportionate to his/her holdings.

     2.   Cumulative voting can be used to elect a director who would represent
          special interests and not those of the corporation and its
          shareholders.

     3.   Cumulative voting can allow a minority to have representation.

     4.   Cumulative Voting can lead to a conflict within the board which could
          interfere with its ability to serve the shareholders' best interests.

                  SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETING
                  ---------------------------------------------

Most state corporation statutes allow shareholders to call a special meeting
when they want to take action on certain matters that arise between regularly
scheduled annual meetings.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict
                                             or prohibit shareholder ability to
                                             call special meetings.

                                             Vote FOR proposals that remove
                                             restrictions on the right of
                                             shareholders to act independently
                                             of management.















                                                                              29

                SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO ALTER SIZE OF THE BOARD
                ------------------------------------------------

Proposals which would allow management to increase or decrease the size of the
board at its own discretion are often used by companies as a takeover defense.

Shareholders should support management proposals to fix the size of the board at
a specific number of directors, preventing management from increasing the size
of the board without shareholder approval. By increasing the size of the board,
management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                             Vote FOR proposal which seek to fix
                                             the size of the board.

                                             Vote AGAINST proposals which give
                                             management the ability to alter
                                             the  size of the board without
                                             shareholder approval.

                               -------------------

Confidential voting, also known as voting by secret ballot, is one of the key
structural issues in the proxy system. All proxies, ballots, and voting
tabulations that identify individual shareholders are kept confidential.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS
                                             Vote FOR shareholder proposals
                                             requesting that corporations adopt
                                             confidential voting.

                                             Vote FOR management proposals to
                                             adopt confidential voting.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Some shareholders elect to have the board not know how they voted on
          certain issues.

     2.   Should the board be aware of how a shareholder voted, the board could
          attempt to influence the shareholder to change his/her vote, giving
          itself an advantage over those that do not have access to this
          information.

     3.   Confidential voting is an important element of corporate democracy
          which should be available to the shareholder.

                         SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES
                         -------------------------------

These proposals request that the corporation establish a shareholder advisory
committee to review the board's performance. In some instances, it would have a
budget funded by the corporation and would be composed of salaried committee
members with authority to hire outside experts and to include reports in the
annual proxy statement.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote AGAINST proposals to establish
                                             a shareholder advisory committee.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Directors already have fiduciary responsibility to represent
          shareholders and are accountable to them by law, thus rendering
          shareholder advisory committees unnecessary.

     2.   Adding another layer to the current corporate governance system would
          be expensive and unproductive.

                            -------------------------

These proposals are usually submitted by companies incorporated outside of the
United States seeking shareholder approval for actions which are considered
ordinary business and do not require shareholder approval in the United States
(i.e., declaration of dividends, approval of financial statements, etc.).

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote FOR proposals that concern

                                             outside of the United States.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   The laws and regulations of various countries differ widely as to
          those issues on which shareholder approval is needed, usually
          requiring consent for actions which are considered routine in the
          United States.

     2.   The board of directors is well-positioned to determine whether or not
          these types of actions are in the best interest of the corporation's
          shareholders.



















                                                                              34

                             GOVERNMENT SERVICE LIST
                             -----------------------

This proposal requests that the board of directors prepare a list of employees
or consultants to the company who have been employed by the government within a
specified period of time and the substance of their involvement.

Solicitation of customers and negotiation of contractual or other business
relationships is traditionally the responsibility of management. Compilation of
such a list does not seem to serve a useful purpose, primarily because existing
laws and regulations serve as a checklist on conflicts of interest.

                                             Vote AGAINST these proposals which

                                             government.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   For certain companies, employing individuals familiar with the
          regulatory agencies and procedures is essential and, therefore, is in
          the best interests of the shareholders.

     2.   Existing laws and regulations require enough disclosure and serve as a
          check on conflicts of interest.

     3.   Additional disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of such
          individual's privacy.

CERES proposals ask management to sign or report on process toward compliance
with ten principles committing the company to environmental stewardship.
Principle 10 directs companies to fill out the CERES report. This report
requires companies to disclose information about environmental policies, toxic
emissions, hazardous waste management, workplace safety, energy use, and
environmental audits.

                              ---------------------

It is well documented that Northern Ireland's Catholic community faces much
higher unemployment figures then the Protestant community. Most proposals ask
companies to endorse or report on progress with respect to the MacBride
Principles.

In evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride Principles, you must decide if
the principles will cause the company to divest, and worsen unemployment
problems.

                                             MacBride Principles.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   We believe that human and political rights are of the utmost
          importance for their own sake as well as for the enhancement of
          economic potential of a nation.

     2.   We do not believe a concrete business case has been made for this
          proposal. We will refrain from making social or political statements
          by voting for these proposals. We will only vote on proposals that
          maximize the value of the issuers' status without regard to (i.e., we
          will not pass judgement upon) the non-economic considerations.

Proposals in this area generally request companies to report on or to adopt
certain principles regarding their operations in foreign countries.

The Maquiladora Standards are a set of guidelines that outline how U.S.
companies should conduct operations in Maquiladora facilities just across the
U.S.-Mexican border. These standards cover such topics as community development,
environmental policies, health and safety policies, and fair employment
practices.

                               ------------------

In regards to equal employment and discrimination, companies without
comprehensive EEO programs will find it hard to recruit qualified employees and
find them at a long-term competitive disadvantage. Companies who are not
carefully watching their human resource practices could also face lawsuits.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             REFRAIN from voting on any

                                             discrimination.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   We feel that the hiring and promotion of employees should be free from
          prohibited discriminatory practices. We also feel that many of these
          issues are already subject to significant state and federal
          regulations.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Needless cruelty to animals should never be tolerated. However, the
          testing of products on animals may be very important to the health and
          safety of consumers.

     2.   We also feel that this issue is already subject to significant state

                           --------------------------

The ability to increase the number of authorized shares could accommodate the
sale of equity, stock splits, dividends, compensation-based plans, etc. The
board can usually be trusted to use additional shares for capital-raising and
other transactions that are in the corporation's best interests.

However, excessive escalation in the number of authorized shares may allow the
board to radically change the corporation's direction without shareholder
approval. Be careful to view that the increased number of shares will not enable
the company to activate a poison pill.

                                             the company.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Is this company going to make frequent business acquisitions over a
          period of time?

     2.   Is the company expanding its operations?

     3.   Within the company, are there any debt structuring or prepackaged

The terms of blank check preferred stock give the board of directors the power
to issue shares of preferred stock at their discretion, with voting, conversion,
distribution and other rights to be determined by the board at the time of the
issue.

Blank check preferred stock can provide corporations with the flexibility to
meet changing financial conditions. However, once the blank check preferred
stock has been authorized, the shareholders have no further power over how or
when it will be allocated.

                                             distribution, and other rights.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Blank check preferred stock can be used as the vehicle for a poison
          pill defense against hostile suitors, or it may be placed in friendly
          hands to help block a takeover bid.

                                -----------------

These proposals request that the corporation provide existing shareholders with
an opportunity to acquire additional shares in proportion to their existing
holdings whenever new shares are issued. In companies with a large shareholder
base and ease in which shareholders could preserve their relative interest
through purchases of shares on the open market, the cost of implementing
preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits.

                                             preemptive rights.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   The existence of preemptive rights can considerably slow down the
          process of issuing new shares due to the logistics involved in
          protecting such rights.

     2.   Preemptive rights are not necessary for the shareholder in today's
          corporations, whose stock is held by a wide range of owners and is, in
          most cases, highly liquid.

                    ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK
                    ----------------------------------------

The purpose of par value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility of
stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. It represents the
maximum amount that a shareholder must pay the corporation if the stock is to be
fully paid when issued.

The corporation requests permission to reduce the par value of its stock. In
most cases, adjusting par value is a routine financing decision and should be
supported.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   State laws sometimes prohibit issuance of new stock priced below that
          of the outstanding shares.

     2.   A corporation may be unable to raise capital if the par value is
          overstated.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Dilution - How much will ownership interest of existing shareholders
          be reduced and how extreme will dilution to future earnings be?

     2.   Change in Control - Will the transaction result in a change of control
          of the company?

     3.   Bankruptcy - Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in severe
          losses in shareholder value, the main factor driving the debt
          restructuring?

     1.   As directors take an increasingly active role in corporate
          decision-making and governance, their compensation is becoming more
          performance-based.

















                                                                              51

            SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO LIMIT EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY
            --------------------------------------------------------

Shareholder compensation proposals that set limits or reduce executive
compensation should be closely scrutinized. Many of these proposals may be
flawed in their emphasis on an absolute dollar figure in compensation.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis


The following factors should be considered:

     1.   Executive compensation is established by a committee that consists of
          independent directors who have fiduciary responsibility to act in the
          best interest of the shareholders and who are best placed to make
          compensation decisions.


















                                                                              52

                     EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)
                     --------------------------------------

These proposals ask for stockholder endorsement of compensation plans for key
employees which involve the issuance of company shares by granting of stock
options, SARs, restricted stock, etc. These plans help attract and retain
best-qualified corporate personnel and tie their interests more closely to those
of the shareholders.

                                             the following items are involved:

     1.   The exercise price for stock options is less than 85% of fair market
          value on the date of the grant.

     2.   It is an omnibus stock plan which gives directors broad discretion in
          deciding how much and what kind of stock to award, when and to whom.

     3.   The shares for issue exceed 8% of the company's outstanding shares;
          or, in the case of the evergreen plans, the amount of increase exceeds
          1.5% of the total number of shares outstanding.

                                             Vote AGAINST proposals adopting

                                             the following items are involved:

     1.   Re-load options (new options issued for any exercised).

     2.   The plan would allow for management to pyramid their holdings by using
          stock to purchase more stock, without having to lay out cash. Vote YES
          if this is for directors.

                                -----------------

Golden parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the
event of a change in control. The change in control agreement will specify the
exact payments to be made under the golden parachutes. The calculation for
payout is usually based on some multiple of an employee's annual or monthly
compensation. Golden parachutes are generally given to employees whose annual
compensation exceeds $112,000.

Recent experience has shown a willingness of many managements to treat severance
agreements as equal to equity investments and to reward themselves as if
substantial amounts of equity were at risk.

                                             limit additional compensation
                                             payments.

                                             for shareholder ratification.


The following factors should be considered:

     1.   The stability of management may be affected by an attempted
          acquisition of the corporation.

     2.   There is a tendency on the part of an entrenched management to
          overstate the value of their continuing control of and influence on
          the day-to-day functions of a corporation.

Based on the foregoing information:

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             We are FOR this proposal, which

                                             because we feel management's
                                             compensation should be solely based
                                             on real-time contributions to the
                                             corporation while they are serving
                                             it. Deferred current compensation
                                             is viewed differently than future,

                       CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals suggest that the board of directors solicit shareholder approval
before committing acquisitions or divestiture of a business exceeding stipulated
threshold levels. Such statutes function by denying shares their voting rights
when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote AGAINST proposals which
                                             request the board to seek
                                             shareholder approval before
                                             committing to an acquisition.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   These proposals deprive the board of directors of its ability to act
          quickly in propitious circumstances.

     2.   Conforming to these requirements can be expensive.

     3.   The board of directors is uniquely qualified and positioned to be able
          to make these decisions without prior shareholder approval.

     4.   The threshold levels usually imposed by these proposals are much more
          stringent than required by law.











                                                                              59

                       OPT-OUT OF STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to opt-out (not be governed by)
certain provisions of the anti-takeover laws of various states. Delaware law,
for instance, dictates that a bidder has to acquire at least 85% of a company's
stock before exercising control, unless he or she has board approval. This means
that a company may thwart an otherwise successful bidder by securing 15% of its
stock in friendly hands.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                             Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for
                                             these proposals.

The following factors should be considered:

     1.   It is the directors' responsibility to act on behalf of the
          shareholders in opposing coercive takeover attempts.

     2.   Creating deterrents to corporate takeovers may allow for entrenchment
          of inefficient management.

     3.   These statutes strengthen the board's ability to deal with potential
          buyers on fair and reasonable terms.

     4.   Shareholders should have the final say on whether the company should
          be merged or acquired.

CONFLICTS
- ---------

From time to time, proxy voting proposals may raise conflicts between the
interests of the Advisers clients and the interests of the Adviser, it's
affiliates and it's employees. Conflicts of interest may arise when:

     1.   Proxy votes regarding non-routine matters are solicited by an issuer
          that may have a separate account relationship with an affiliate of the
          Adviser or an investment banking relationship with Fahnestock & Co.
          Inc.

     2.   A proponent of a proxy proposal has a business relationship with the
          Adviser or one of its affiliates or the Adviser or one of its
          affiliates has a business relationship with participants in proxy
          contests, corporate directors or director candidates.

     3.   An employee of the Adviser has a personal interest in the outcome of a
          particular matter before shareholders.

If the Adviser receives a proxy that to the knowledge of the Proxy Manager
raises a conflict of interest, the Proxy Manager shall advise the Governance
Committee which shall determine whether the conflict is "material" to any
specific proposal involved in the proxy. The Governance Committee will determine
whether the proposal is material as follows:

     1.   Routine proxy proposals are presumed not to involve a material
          conflict of interest.

     2.   Non-routine proxy proposals-Proxy proposals that are "non- routine"
          will be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest unless the
          Governance Committee determines that the conflict is unrelated to the
          proposal. Non-routine proposals would include a merger, compensation
          matters for management and contested elections of directors.





                                                                              63

CONFLICTS CONT'D

     3.   The Governance Committee may determine on a case by case basis that
          particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material conflict of
          interest because the proposal is not directly related to the Adviser's
          conflict vis-a-vis the issue. The Governance Committee will record the
          basis for any such determination. With respect to any proposal that
          the Governance Committee determines presents a material conflict of
          interest, the Adviser may vote regarding that proposal in any of the
          following ways:
          a)   Obtain instructions from the client on how to vote.
          b)   Use existing proxy guidelines if the policy with respect to the
               proposal is specifically addressed and does not involve a case by
               case analysis.
          c)   Vote the proposal that involves the conflict according to the
               recommendations of an independent third party such as
               Institutional Share Services Inc. or Investor Responsibility
               Research Center.

SPECIAL ISSUES WITH VOTING FOREIGN PROXIES
- ------------------------------------------


    Voting proxies with respect to shares of foreign stock may involve
significantly greater effort and corresponding cost than voting proxies in the
U.S domestic market. Issues in voting foreign proxies include the following:

          1.   Each country has its own rules and practices regarding
               shareholder notification, voting restrictions, registration
               conditions and share blocking.

          2.   In some foreign countries shares may be "blocked" by custodian or
               depository or bearer shares deposited with specific financial
               institutions for a certain number of days before or after the
               shareholders meeting. When blocked, shares typically may not be
               traded until the day after the blocking period. Advantage may
               refrain from voting shares of foreign stocks subject to blocking
               restrictions where in the Adviser's judgment; the benefit from
               voting the shares is outweighed by the interest in maintaining
               client liquidity in the shares. This decision is made on a case
               by case basis based on a relevant factors including the length of
               the blocking period, the significance of the holding and whether
               the stock is considered by a long-term holding.


          3.   Time frames between shareholder notification, distribution of
               proxy materials, book closures and the actual meeting date may be
               too short to allow timely action.

          4.   In certain countries, applicable regulations require that votes
               must be made in person at the shareholder meeting. The Adviser
               will weigh the costs and benefits of voting on proxy proposals in
               countries that require in person voting on a case by case basis
               and make decisions on whether voting on a given proxy proposal is
               prudent. Generally, the Adviser will not vote shares in countries
               that require in person voting on routine matters such as
               uncontested elections of directors, ratification of auditors.





                                                                              69

RECORD KEEPING
- --------------

Advantage will maintain the following records:

     1.   Copies of these policies

     2.   A copy of each proxy statement that the Adviser receives regarding
          client securities. The Adviser may satisfy this requirement by relying
          on a third party to keep copies of proxy statements provided that the
          Adviser has an undertaking from the third party to provide a copy of
          the proxy statement promptly upon request.

     3.   A record of each vote cast on behalf of a client. A third party may
          keep these voting records provided that the Adviser has an undertaking
          from the third party to provide a copy of the record promptly upon
          request.

     4.   A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to
          making a decision on how to vote proxies or that memorializes the
          basis for that decision.

                                                                       July 2003

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO RULES
        PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code") of the registered investment companies set
forth in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to
each Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth
in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or the Covered Officer's service to,
a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or
a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal benefits as
a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts

<PAGE>

may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between a Fund
and its investment adviser or a third party service provider of which the
Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the applicable Fund or for its investment adviser or a
third party service provider, or for one or more of them), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser, third party service provider and Fund. The participation
of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationship between a Fund and its adviser or third party service provider and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. The foregoing activities, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle with respect to all conflicts
of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a Covered
Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Company.

     Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     o    not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit the Fund; and

     o    report at least annually his or her affiliations or other
          relationships that could potentially present a conflict of interest
          with the Fund.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o    Each Covered Officer of a Fund shall become familiar with the
          disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     o    each Covered Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly misrepresent, or
          cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
          within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's management and
          auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     o    each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent appropriate within
          the Covered Officer's area of responsibility and to the extent deemed
          necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer, consult with
          other officers and employees of the Fund and its investment adviser
          with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
          understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
          with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
          by the Fund; and


                                      -2-

<PAGE>

     o    each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
          Fund with applicable standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
     Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the Fund
     that the Covered Officer has received, read and understands the Code;

o    annually thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that the
     Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the Fund
     or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations of the Code
     that are made in good faith; and

o    notify the Compliance Officer of the Fund promptly if the Covered Officer
     knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
     of this Code.

     The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with counsel to
the Fund and counsel to the Managers of the Fund who are not "interested
persons," as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, of the
Fund (the "Independent Managers"), and is encouraged to do so. However, any
approvals or waivers 1 must be considered by the Independent Managers.

     Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

o    the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate any
     reported potential violations;

o    if, after such investigation, the Compliance Officer believes that no
     violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take any
     further action;

o    any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
     reported to the Independent Managers;

o    if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred, the
     Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
     which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of, and
     appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
     notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment

- --------
1    For this purpose, the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund of a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the Fund's
     failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics that has been
     made known to Fund management.


                                      -3-

<PAGE>

     adviser or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to dismiss
     the Covered Officer; and

o    any  changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent  required,  be
     disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's investment adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act of each Fund, its investment adviser and principal
underwriter is a separate requirement applying to the Covered Officers and
others, and is not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Amendments to this Code may be made from time to time, as deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance Officer. The Board of each Fund shall be
informed of any such amendment to the extent deemed material by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records relating to a Fund prepared or maintained pursuant
to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and
protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such
matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
