Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

Announcement to Shareholders

On February 15, 2006, BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") and Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") entered into an agreement to contribute Merrill Lynch's
investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, L.P. and
certain affiliates (including Fund Asset Management, L.P. and Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers International Limited), to BlackRock to create a new
independent company that will be one of the world's largest asset management
firms with nearly $1 trillion in assets under management (based on combined
assets under management as of December 31, 2005). The transaction is expected to
close in the third quarter of 2006, at which time the new company will operate
under the BlackRock name. If approved by the Fund's Board of Directors and Fund
Shareholders, the combined company that results from the transaction is expected
to become the investment adviser of the Fund.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leverage through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

Financial markets began 2006 with a return to volatility following a fairly
uninspiring 2005. For the six- and 12-month periods ended February 28, 2006,
most major market indexes landed in positive territory:

</TABLE>

The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) increased interest rates 200 basis points
(2.00%) over the past 12 months, bringing the target federal funds rate to 4.5%.
Notably, Ben Bernanke replaced Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman in January, a
month after the central bank removed the critical word "measured" from the
description of its rate-hiking program. Still, most observers expect at least
one more interest rate hike before the Fed pauses in its tightening campaign.

U.S. economic growth, which came in at 4.1% in the third quarter of 2005, fell
to 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Growth is expected to reaccelerate in the first
quarter of 2006, although the economy is likely to feel some pressure in the
quarters ahead as the consumer sector seems to be softening. Capital spending by
businesses, however, appears relatively strong. Overall corporate health,
including strong company balance sheets, helped prompt robust
dividend-distribution, share-buyback and merger-and-acquisition activity in
2005, a trend that has continued in 2006. This, as well as reasonably good
company earnings and low core inflation, has been supportive of U.S. stocks
despite the headwinds of rising interest rates and high energy prices. Many
international equity markets have fared even better, thanks in part to higher
economic growth rates and low inflation.

In the U.S. bond market, short-term interest rates continued to move higher as
longer-term interest rates advanced more moderately. After flattening
dramatically in 2005, the Treasury curve recently has been toying with bouts of
inversion, whereby short-term yields have surpassed long-term yields. At
period-end, the six-month Treasury bill offered the highest yield on the curve
at 4.74%.

Amid the uncertainty inherent in the financial markets, we encourage you to
review your goals periodically with your financial advisor and to make portfolio
changes, as needed. For timely "food for thought" for investors, we also invite
you to visit Shareholder magazine at www.mlim.ml.com/shareholdermagazine. As
always, we thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your
investment assets, and we look forward to continuing to serve your investment
needs.

                                                         Sincerely,


                                                         /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      The Fund provided competitive returns and an attractive yield during the
fiscal year as we continued to use our credit-driven investment process to
maintain a well-diversified portfolio.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the 12-month period ended February 28, 2006, the Common Stock of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 9.65% and 9.53%, based on a
year-end per share net asset value of $6.69 and a per share market price of
$6.77, respectively, and $.645 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +4.57%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $7.06 to $6.69, and assuming
reinvestment of all distributions. The Fund's total return for the period kept
in line with the +4.62% return of its benchmark, which is an equal blend of the
Credit Suisse High Yield Index and the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2006, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +3.61%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $6.79 to $6.69, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions. The
blended benchmark returned +2.46% for the same period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

The high yield market was quite volatile during the 12 months ended February 28,
2006. In spring 2005, we saw the downgrades of both Ford Motor Co.'s and General
Motors Corp.'s debt to junk bond status. Uncertainty regarding the absolute
volume of bonds that would constitute "fallen angels" (that is, bonds that move
from investment grade to junk bond status) and the impact of the downgrades on
the high yield index caused some investors in the asset class to head for the
sidelines. This led to price weakness and spread widening, particularly among
the lower-rated junk bond categories. The market gained perspective on the auto
downgrades, rallied through late spring and summer, but retreated in the fall
following the bankruptcy filing of auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive Systems.
For this 12-month reporting period, the Credit Suisse High Yield Index returned
a relatively modest +3.27%.

In contrast, the bank loan market, as represented by the Credit Suisse Leveraged
Loan Index, remained solid during the fiscal year, posting a return of +5.96%
for the 12 months ended February 28, 2006. This is primarily attributable to the
senior secured status of bank loans, which made them less vulnerable to credit
concerns when compared to high yield bonds. Another factor contributing to the
strong performance of leveraged loans is collateralized loan obligations (CLOs),
which now hold more than 60% of the leveraged loan market. As the financing for
these structured products has become less expensive, so too has the spread
required in the leveraged loan space to make this model work. We are seeing
leveraged loan spreads at historically tight levels. The prospect for further
spread tightening relies primarily on the cost of CLO financing going forward.

What factors most influenced Fund performance?

Specific credits that contributed most to performance during the past year
included Winstar Communications, High Voltage Engineering Corp. (HVE) and Trico
Marine Services, Inc. The Fund had participated in a DIP (debtor-in-possession)
financing for Winstar back in 2001. We wrote off $3 million that went unpaid
following the conversion of the case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a
Chapter 7 liquidation. However, there was an open litigation proceeding against
Lucent Technologies Inc. wherein the judge recently (in January 2006) ruled in
favor of Winstar. We reinstated this position in the portfolio at $4.1 million,
which represents the market bid for the DIP loan plus accrued interest.

Our 501,000 common equity share position in HVE rallied from $1.50 to $9.00 per
share during the period. The price of this equity, which we received in 2004 in
a Chapter 11 reorganization, had been under pressure as the company faced
daunting liquidity issues arising from overextended working capital positions.
Subsequently, the company's principal division, Robicon Corp., was sold to
Siemens AG at a surprisingly strong multiple, which propelled the stock upward.
We liquidated this position in August.


4       DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.       FEBRUARY 28, 2006
<PAGE>

Finally, our $6 million bond position in marine oil service company Trico was
converted to equity via a Chapter 11 reorganization in 2005. The Fund received
shares which rose in price from $16.63 to $29.13 per share. This move reflects
the strong momentum across the entire energy spectrum in the current price
environment.

Investments that detracted most from Fund performance included Pliant
Corporation, GEO Specialty Chemicals, Inc. and Refco Finance Holdings LLC. Our
$12.3 million position in Pliant, a flexible plastic packaging corporation,
collapsed from 98 to 27 during the year. An already difficult financial position
arising from high resin prices worsened following the August and September
hurricanes. Resin suppliers put Pliant on order allocation (that is, rationing),
and then subsequently withdrew trade support. Pliant's liquidity position became
untenable, leading to a Chapter 11 filing on January 4, 2006.

The Fund holds $9.8 million in bonds and 339,000 shares of common stock of GEO,
a specialty chemicals company that services niche markets in electronics, paints
and coatings, construction, water treatment and rubber additives. In 2005, high
energy costs and raw material inflation hurt the company's profit margins as
costs rose faster than prices. This caused the bonds to decline in price from
$106.75 to $86.00, while the share price of the equity declined from $15.00 to
$4.50. This trend has abated recently, and we believe 2006 should prove to be a
key turnaround year for the company.

Financial services company Refco filed for Chapter 11 reorganization following
the announcement that the company had discovered that it was owed a debt of
approximately $430 million by an entity controlled by the company's CEO. The
value of our Refco bonds, which were marked at $108.75 on September 30, 2005,
plunged sharply. We liquidated our $7.6 million position at an average price of
$50.00.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

We continued to shorten the portfolio's duration, thereby limiting the price
sensitivity to rising long-term interest rates, by investing in floating rate
notes and bank loans. The Fund is currently at a roughly 60% fixed rate/40%
floating rate composition. We intend to aim for a 50% fixed/50% floating make-up
in 2006. We think this makes sense given the flat yield curve and our conviction
that the probability of rising long-term rates far outweighs that of declining
long-term rates.

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We are on target for a 50% fixed rate/50% floating rate allocation in 2006. Our
investment approach will continue to be credit-driven, with the aim of
maintaining a well-diversified investment portfolio. We also intend to maintain
our use of leverage within a target range of 25% - 30%.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including floating rate loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and
other financial institutions, the Fund's investment in floating rate loans could
be considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Floating rate loans are valued in accordance
with guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Floating rate loans are
valued at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or
more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the
limited number of floating rate loans for which no reliable price quotes are
available, such floating rate loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
through the use of pricing matrixes to determine valuations. If the pricing
service does not provide a value for floating rate loans, Fund Asset Management,
L.P. ("FAM") will value the floating rate loans at fair value, which is intended
to approximate market value.

Debt securities are traded primarily in the over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and
are valued at the last available bid price in the OTC markets or on the basis of
values as obtained by a pricing service. Pricing services use valuation matrixes
that incorporate both dealer-supplied valuations and valuation models. The
procedures of the pricing service and its valuations are reviewed by the
officers of the Fund under the general direction of the Board of Directors. Such
valuations and procedures will be reviewed periodically by the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

Securities that are held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
Nasdaq National Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business
on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last
available bid price for long positions, and at the last available asked price
for short positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one
exchange, the securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary
market by or under the authority of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Long
positions in securities traded in the OTC market, Nasdaq Small Cap or Bulletin
Board are valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained
from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of Directors
of the Fund. Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued
at the last available asked price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in
the OTC market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and
most representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the
premium received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an
equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to
reflect the current market value of the option written, based on the last sale
price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded
in the OTC market, the last asked price. Options purchased by the Fund are
valued at their last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in
the case of options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. Swap
agreements are valued based upon quoted fair valuations received daily by the
Fund from a pricing service or counterparty. Other investments, including
futures contracts and related options, are stated at market value. Obligations
with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost unless
FAM believes that this method no longer produces fair valuations. Repurchase
agreements will be valued at cost plus accrued interest.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. Government securities,
money market instruments and certain fixed income securities, is substantially
completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE.
The values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign currency exchange rates
also are generally determined prior to the close of business on the NYSE.
Occasionally, events affecting the values of such securities and such exchange
rates may occur between the times at which they are determined and the close of
business on the NYSE that may not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's
net asset value. If events (for example, a company announcement, market
volatility or a natural disaster) occur during such periods that are expected to
materially affect the value of such securities, those securities may be valued
at their fair

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or by FAM using a
pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
      marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
      written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
      option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted
      from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to)
      the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund
      enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on
      the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss
      to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid
      or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts
      in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments
      on a specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set
      period of time or may be triggered by a pre-determined credit event. The
      net periodic payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate;
      the change in market value of a specified security, basket of securities,
      or index; or the return generated by a security. These periodic payments
      received or made by the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of
      Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are
      also realized upon termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are
      marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.
The Fund invests in foreign securities, which may involve a number of risk
factors and special considerations not present with investments in securities of
U.S. corporations.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(h) Securities lending -- The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least
100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market value of
the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business
day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the loaned securities,
it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically receives the income on
the loaned securities but does not receive the income on the collateral. Where
the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such collateral and retain the
amount earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the borrower.
Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the borrower, after notice,
is required to return borrowed securities within five business days. The Fund
may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in
connection with its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its
obligation to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access to the
collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral
falls below the market value of the borrowed securities, in the event of
borrower default or in the event of losses on investments made with cash
collateral.

(i) Bank overdraft -- The Fund recorded a bank overdraft, which resulted from
management estimates of available cash.

(j) Reclassifications -- U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require
that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent
differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly, during the current
year, $12,067,388 has been reclassified between paid-in capital in excess of par
and accumulated net realized capital losses, $1,112,781 has been reclassified
between accumulated net realized capital losses and undistributed net investment
income and $2,825 has been reclassified between undistributed net investment
income and paid-in capital in excess of par as a result of permanent differences
attributable to expiration of capital loss carryforwards, securities in default
and amortization methods on fixed income securities. These reclassifications
have no effect on net assets or net asset value per share.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with FAM. The general
partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML & Co."), which is the limited
partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, an affiliate of FAM, or its affiliates. Pursuant to
that order, the Fund also has retained Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, LLC
("MLIM, LLC"), an affiliate of FAM, as the securities lending agent for a fee
based on a share of the returns on investment of cash collateral. MLIM, LLC may,
on behalf of the Fund, invest cash collateral received by the Fund for such
loans, among other things, in a private investment company managed by MLIM, LLC
or in registered money market funds advised by FAM or its affiliates.

For the year ended February 28, 2006, the Fund reimbursed FAM $16,996 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, PSI, ML & Co., and/or MLIM, LLC.

In February 2006, ML & Co. and BlackRock, Inc. entered into an agreement to
merge ML & Co.'s investment management business, including FAM, with the
investment management business of BlackRock, Inc. The transaction is expected to
close in the third quarter of 2006.

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales (including paydowns) of investments, excluding short-term
securities, for the year ended February 28, 2006 were $450,666,684 and
$456,242,339, respectively.

4. Capital Share Transactions:

The Fund is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value
$.10 per share. The Board of Directors is authorized, however, to classify and
reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock without approval of the holders
of Common Stock.

Shares issued and outstanding during the years ended February 28, 2006 and
February 28, 2005 increased by 252,856 and 374,356, respectively, as a result of
dividend reinvestment.

5. Unfunded Corporate Loans:

As of February 28, 2006, the Fund had unfunded loan commitments of $1,375,000,
which would be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to the following
loan agreements.

                                                                  (in Thousands)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

On May 24, 2005, the Fund renewed its revolving credit and security agreement
funded by a commercial paper asset securitization program with Citigroup North
America, Inc. ("Citigroup") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and
certain asset securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The agreement
was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $370,000,000. Under the
Citigroup program, the conduits will fund advances to the Fund through the
issuance of highly rated commercial paper. As security for its obligations to
the Lenders under the revolving securitization facility, the Fund has granted a
security interest in substantially all of its assets to and in favor of the
Lenders. The interest rate on the Fund's borrowings is based on the interest
rate carried by the commercial paper plus a program fee. The Fund pays
additional borrowing costs including a backstop commitment fee.

The weighted average annual interest rate was 3.84% and the average borrowing
was approximately $294,371,000 for the year ended February 28, 2006.

7. Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund paid an ordinary income dividend in the amount of $.053000 per share on
March 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2006.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended February
28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 was as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   2/28/2006          2/28/2005

As of February 28, 2006, the components of accumulated losses on a tax basis
were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undistributed ordinary income--net .....................        $   5,720,274
Undistributed long-term capital gains--net .............                   --

                                                                -------------
Total accumulated losses--net ..........................        $(355,637,405)
                                                                =============

*     On February 28, 2006, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $334,486,594, of which $27,376,921 expires in 2007, $51,234,056 expires in
      2008, $21,442,332 expires in 2009, $90,564,493 expires in 2010,
      $85,285,305 expires in 2011, $17,223,475 expires in 2012, $21,126,025
      expires in 2013 and $20,233,987 expires in 2014. This amount will be
      available to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.

**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized losses is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      difference between book and tax amortization methods for premiums and
      discounts on fixed income securities, book/tax differences in the accrual

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and capital,
including the schedule of investments, of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. as of
February 28, 2006, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of February 28, 2006, by correspondence with the
custodian and financial intermediaries; where replies were not received from
financial intermediaries, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. as of February 28, 2006, the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and its financial highlights for the
five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

How the Plan Works -- The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by the Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the sharehold- ers by The Bank of New York
(the "Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Fund declares a dividend,
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the participant's
account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized shares
of the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares of
Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset value per share is equal to
or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage commissions (a
condition often referred to as a "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest
the dividend amount in newly issued shares. If the Fund's net asset value per
share is greater than the market price per share (a condition often referred to
as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount by
purchasing on the open market additional shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend amount in open market purchases, or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent
will invest any uninvested portion in newly issued shares. The shares acquired
are credited to each shareholder's account. The amount credited is determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by either (i) when the shares are
newly issued, the net asset value per share on the date the shares are issued or
(ii) when shares are purchased in the open market, the average purchase price
per share.

Participation in the Plan -- Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Fund unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time
without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan -- The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants
in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they could otherwise
purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received. However, there may not be enough shares
available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem shares, the price on resale
may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees -- There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders will
pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications -- The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore, income and
capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not receive
cash. Participation in the Plan generally will not effect the tax-exempt status
of exempt interest dividends paid by the Fund. If, when the Fund's shares are
trading at a market premium, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that
have a greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is
possible that all or a portion of the discount from the market value (which may
not exceed 5% of the fair market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as
a taxable distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it
is also possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable
to all the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the
Plan. Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information -- All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The Bank of
New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY 10286-1258,
Telephone: 800-432-8224.

         The nature of the services include assurance and related services
         reasonably related to the performance of the audit of financial
         statements not included in Audit Fees.

         (c) Tax Fees -           Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2006 - $6,000

         planning.

         (d) All Other Fees -     Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2006 - $0
                                  Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2005 - $0

         (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
         Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
         registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
         Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
         provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to the
         registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly to the
         operations and the financial reporting of the registrant. Certain of
         these non-audit services that the Committee believes are a) consistent
         with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b) routine and recurring
         services that will not impair the independence of the independent
         accountants may be approved by the Committee without consideration on a
         specific case-by-case basis ("general pre-approval"). However, such
         services will only be deemed pre-approved provided that any individual
         project does not exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or
         $50,000 for all of the registrants the Committee oversees. Any proposed
         services exceeding the pre-approved cost levels will require specific
         pre-approval by the Committee, as will any other services not subject
         to general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).
         The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
         pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board meeting.

         (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered and determined that
         the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the

         by, or under common control with the investment adviser that provides
         ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant
         to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible

Item 7 - Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
         Management Investment Companies -

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that the Investment Adviser considers
         the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not the
         interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that real
         (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Investment
         Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's clients are
         properly addressed and resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a
         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except
         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested
         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting

<PAGE>

         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

<PAGE>

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

      (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest

      Real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a
portfolio manager has day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities with
respect to more than one fund or account, including the following:

<PAGE>

      Certain investments may be appropriate for the Fund and also for other
clients advised by the Investment. Adviser and its affiliates, including other
client accounts managed by the Fund's portfolio management team. Investment
decisions for the Fund and other clients are made with a view to achieving their
respective investment objectives and after consideration of such factors as
their current holdings, availability of cash for investment and the size of
their investments generally. Frequently, a particular security may be bought or
sold for only one client or in different amounts and at different times for more
than one but less than all clients. Likewise, because clients of the Investment
Adviser and its affiliates may have differing investment strategies, a
particular security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other
clients are selling the security. The investment results for the Fund may differ
from the results achieved by other clients of the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates and results among clients may differ. In addition, purchases or sales
of the same security may be made for two or more clients on the same day. In
such event, such transactions will be allocated among the clients in a manner
believed by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates to be equitable to each.
The Investment Adviser will not determine allocations based on whether it
receives a performance based fee from the client. In some cases, the allocation
procedure could have an adverse effect on the price or amount of the securities
purchased or sold by the Fund. Purchase and sale orders for the Fund may be
combined with those of other clients of the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates in the interest of achieving the most favorable net results to the
Fund.

      To the extent that the Fund's portfolio management team has
responsibilities for managing accounts in addition to the Fund, a portfolio
manager will need to divide his time and attention among relevant accounts.

      In some cases, a real, potential or apparent conflict may also arise where
(i) the Investment Adviser may have an incentive, such as a performance based
fee, in managing one account and not with respect to other accounts it manages
or (ii) where a member of the Fund's portfolio management team owns an interest
in one fund or account he or she manages and not another.

      (a)(3) As of February 28, 2006:

      Portfolio Manager Compensation

      The Portfolio Manager Compensation Program of MLIM and its affiliates,
including the Investment Adviser (collectively, "MLIM"), is critical to MLIM's
ability to attract and retain the most talented asset management professionals.
This program ensures that compensation is aligned with maximizing investment
returns and it provides a competitive pay opportunity for competitive
performance.

      Compensation Program

      The elements of total compensation for MLIM portfolio managers are a fixed
base salary, annual performance-based cash and stock compensation (cash and
stock bonus) and other benefits. MLIM has balanced these components of pay to
provide portfolio managers with a powerful incentive to achieve consistently
superior investment performance. By design, portfolio manager compensation
levels fluctuate -- both up and down -- with the relative investment performance
of the portfolios that they manage.

<PAGE>

      Base Salary

      Under the MLIM approach, like that of many asset management firms, base
salaries that are fixed on an annual basis represent a relatively small portion
of a portfolio manager's total compensation. This approach serves to enhance the
motivational value of the performance-based (and therefore variable)
compensation elements of the compensation program.

      Performance-Based Compensation

      MLIM believes that the best interests of investors are served by
recruiting and retaining exceptional asset management talent and managing their
compensation within a consistent and disciplined framework that emphasizes pay
for performance in the context of an intensely competitive market for talent.

      To that end, portfolio manager incentive compensation for MLIM and its
affiliates is based on a formulaic compensation program. MLIM's formulaic
portfolio manager compensation program includes: investment performance relative
to general closed-end, non-leveraged, fixed income funds over 1-, 3-, and 5-year
performance periods and a measure of operational efficiency. Portfolio managers
are compensated based on the pre-tax performance of the products they manage. A
discretionary element of portfolio manager compensation may include
consideration of: financial results of MLIM, expense control, profit margins,
strategic planning and implementation, quality of client service, market share,
corporate reputation, capital allocation, compliance and risk control,
leadership, workforce diversity, technology and innovation. MLIM and its
affiliates also consider the extent to which individuals exemplify and foster
Merrill Lynch's principles of client focus, respect for the individual,
teamwork, responsible citizenship and integrity. All factors are considered
collectively by MLIM management.

      Cash Bonus

      Performance-based compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a
combination of cash and stock. Typically, the cash bonus, when combined with
base salary, represents more than 60% of total compensation for portfolio
managers.

      Stock Bonus

      A portion of the dollar value of the total annual performance-based bonus
is paid in restricted shares of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (herein, the
"Company") stock. Paying a portion of annual bonuses in stock puts compensation
earned by a portfolio manager for a given year "at risk" based on the Company's
ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods. The ultimate
value of stock bonuses is dependent on future Company stock price performance.
As such, the stock bonus aligns each portfolio manager's financial interests
with those of the Company shareholders and encourages a balance between
short-term goals and long-term strategic objectives. Management strongly
believes that providing a significant portion of competitive performance-based
compensation in stock is in the best interests of investors and shareholders.
This approach ensures that portfolio managers participate as shareholders in
both the "downside risk" and "upside opportunity" of the Company's performance.
Portfolio managers therefore have a direct incentive to protect the Company's
reputation for integrity.

      Other Compensation Programs

      Portfolio managers who meet relative investment performance and financial
management objectives during a performance year are eligible to participate in a
deferred cash program. Awards under this program are in the form of deferred
cash that may be benchmarked to a menu of MLIM mutual funds (including their own
fund) during a five-year vesting period. The deferred cash program aligns the
interests of participating portfolio managers with the investment results of
MLIM products and promotes continuity of successful portfolio management teams.

<PAGE>

      Other Benefits

      Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in broad-based plans
offered generally to the Company's employees, including broad-based retirement,
401(k), health, and other employee benefit plans.

         (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of February 28, 2006, Mr.
                Booth beneficially owns stock issued by the Fund in the range of
                $100,001 - $500,000.
