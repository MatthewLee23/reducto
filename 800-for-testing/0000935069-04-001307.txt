THE INDIA FUND, INC.

                                                                 August 24, 2004

DEAR FUND SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to present you with the unaudited financial statements of The
India Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004.

The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") closed at $19.82 on June 30, 2004,
representing a decrease of 16.58% from the Fund's NAV on December 31, 2003. The
Fund outperformed its benchmark, the IFC Investable Index ("IFC"), which
decreased 17.28% for the same six-month period.

The Indian stock market endured a volatile first-half of 2004 as general
elections yielded a new leadership. Uncertainty over the new government's
commitment to economic reforms shook confidence in the markets. In the annual
Budget announcement held in July, the new government addressed problems such as
the fiscal deficit and poor infrastructure by pledging increased tax revenues
and increased spending on infrastructure projects. The government also assuaged
fears of a slowdown in economic reforms by easing limits in foreign direct
investment in key sectors and lowering the turnover tax. Foreign investment,
slowed down by political events, remained positive as foreign institutional
inflow reportedly totaled over $3.47 billion during the first-half of calendar
year 2004.

Looking ahead, India faces the challenge of a new leadership while keeping a
fragile coalition together. In addition, monsoons will be closely watched as the
season started in disappointing fashion. Monsoons are an important catalyst for
agricultural growth as 60% of India's population (20% of GDP) is geared to the
rural economy. Nevertheless, we believe valuations look more compelling than
they did at the end of 2003 and we remain positive in the long-term fundamental
outlook for India.


                                                                               1

Sincerely,


/s/ Bryan McKigney

FUNDAMENTAL PERIODIC REPURCHASE POLICY

The Fund has adopted the following fundamental policy regarding periodic
repurchases:

      a)    The Fund will make offers to repurchase its shares at semi-annual
            intervals pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of
            1940, as amended from time to time ("Offers"). The Board of
            Directors may place such conditions and limitations on Offers as may
            be permitted under Rule 23c-3.

      b)    14 days prior to the last Friday of the Fund's first and third
            fiscal quarters, or the next business day if such Friday is not a
            business day, will be the deadline (the "Repurchase Request
            Deadline") by which the Fund must receive repurchase requests
            submitted by stockholders in response to the most recent Offer.

      c)    The date on which the repurchase price for shares is to be
            determined (the "Repurchase Pricing Date") shall occur no later than
            the last Friday of the Fund's first and third fiscal quarters, or
            the next business day if such day is not a business day.

      d)    Offers may be suspended or postponed under certain circumstances, as
            provided for in Rule 23c-3.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                        (UNAUDITED)

NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The India Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on December 27,
1993, and commenced operations on February 23, 1994. The Fund operates through a
branch in the Republic of Mauritius. The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end, non-diversified management
investment company.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

PORTFOLIO VALUATION. Investments are stated at value in the accompanying
financial statements. All securities for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at:

      (i)   the last sales price prior to the time of determination, if there
            was a sale on the date of determination,

      (ii)  at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices, if there
            was no sales price on such date and bid and asked quotations are
            available, and

      (iii) at the bid price if there was no sales price on such date and only
            bid quotations are available.

Securities that are traded over-the-counter are valued, if bid and asked
quotations are available, at the mean between the current bid and asked prices.
Securities for which sales prices and bid and asked quotations are not available
on the date of determination may be valued at the most recently available prices
or quotations under policies adopted by the Board of Directors. Investments in
short-term debt securities having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost which approximates market value. Securities for which market
values are not readily ascertainable are carried at fair value as determined in
good faith by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors. The net asset
value per share of the Fund is calculated weekly and at the end of each month.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. The cost of investments sold is determined by
use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
income tax reporting purposes. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis;
dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or, using reasonable
diligence, when known. The collectibility of income receivable from Indian
securities is evaluated periodically, and any resulting allowances for
uncollectible amounts are reflected currently in the determination of investment
income.

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

TAX STATUS. No provision is made for U.S. federal income or excise taxes as it
is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to make the requisite distributions to its shareholders that will be
sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all Federal income and excise
taxes.

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2003:

Ordinary income ..............................................    $   3,046,584
                                                                  =============

At December 31, 2003, the components of net assets (excluding paid in capital)
on a tax basis were as follows:

Overdistribution of Ordinary Income ..........   $    (214,070)
Plus/Less: Cumulative Timing Differences .....         (44,129)
                                                 -------------
Overdistribution of net investment income ....................     $   (258,199)
                                                                   ------------
Tax basis capital loss carryover .............   $ (42,954,175)
Plus/Less: Cumulative Timing Differences .....      (1,405,122)
                                                 -------------
Accumulated net realized loss on investments .................      (44,359,297)
                                                                   ------------

Book unrealized foreign exchange loss ........................          (98,491)
                                                                   ------------

Tax unrealized appreciation ..................   $ 286,760,632
Plus/Less: Cumulative Timing Differences .....       1,405,122
                                                 -------------
Unrealized appreciation ......................................      288,165,754
                                                                   ------------
Net assets (excluding paid in capital) .......................     $243,449,767

The differences between book and tax basis unrealized appreciation is primarily
attributable to wash sales and a dividend overdistribution. The cumulative
timing difference for the capital loss carryover is due to Post October Losses.

Net Asset Value ..............................................    $ 556,811,341
Paid in Capital ..............................................     (313,361,574)

THE INDIA FUND, INC.

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had a capital loss carryover of $42,954,175 which
is available to offset future net realized gains on securities transactions to
the extent provided for in the Internal Revenue Code. Of the aggregate capital
losses, $11,095,634 will expire in 2006, $20,935,877 will expire in 2009 and
$10,922,664 will expire in 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Fund utilized $33,704,004 of prior year capital loss carryforwards.

The Fund's realized foreign exchange losses incurred after October 31, 2003, but
before December 31, 2003, are deemed to arise on the first business day of the
following year. The Fund incurred and elected to defer such realized foreign
exchange losses of $44,129.

During the period ended December 31, 2003, the Fund reclassified $183,331 from
accumulated net realized loss on investments to overdistribution of net
investment income as a result of permanent book and tax differences relating
primarily to realized foreign currency gains. Net investment income and net
assets were not affected by the reclassifications.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

      (i)   market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
            prevailing rates of exchange on the valuation date; and

      (ii)  purchases and sales of investment securities and investment income
            at the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates
            of such transactions.

The Fund generally does not isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates from the effect of fluctuations in the market prices of
securities. However, the Fund does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency rates when determining the gain or loss upon the sale of foreign
currency denominated debt obligations pursuant to U.S. Federal income tax
regulations; such amounts are categorized as foreign currency gains or losses
for federal income tax purposes. The Fund reports certain realized foreign
exchange gains and losses as components of realized gains and losses for
financial reporting purposes, whereas such amounts are treated as ordinary
income for Federal income tax reporting purposes.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Foreign security
and currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not
typically associated with those of domestic origin as a result of, among other
factors, the level of governmental supervision and regulation of foreign
securities markets and the possibility of political or economic instability, and
the fact that foreign securities markets may be smaller and have less developed
and less reliable settlement and share registration procedures.

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS. The Fund intends to distribute annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income, including foreign
currency gains, and to distribute annually any net realized gains after the
utilization of available capital loss carryovers. An additional distribution may
be made to the extent necessary to avoid payment of a 4% Federal excise tax.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount
of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized gains
are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations, which may
differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their Federal
tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.
Dividends and distributions which exceed net investment income and net realized
capital gains for financial reporting purposes but not for tax purposes are
reported as dividends in excess of net investment income and net realized
capital gains. To the extent they exceed net investment income and net realized
gains for tax purposes, they are reported as distributions of additional paid-in
capital.

ended June 30, 2004, administration fees amounted to $543,347 (Prior to June 4,

amended (the "1940 Act"), the Fund's then-existing Management Agreement and
Country Advisory Agreement provided for their automatic termination in the event
of their "assignment" as defined in the 1940 Act. Consummation of the
acquisition by Fahnestock and FVH of the asset management business of CIBC WM
constituted an assignment of the Fund's then existing Management Agreement and
Country Advisory Agreement. At a meeting on January 17, 2003, the Board of
Directors of the Fund, including a majority of the independent Directors,
approved a new investment management agreement between the Fund and Advantage
and a new country advisory agreement between Advantage and Imperial. The
acquisition by Fahnestock and FVH of CIBC WM's U.S. asset management business
was completed on June 4, 2003. In connection with the June 4, 2003 acquisition,
a new investment management agreement and country advisory agreement dated June
4, 2003 was executed, having been previously approved by the Board of Directors
of the Fund, including a majority of the independent Directors at a special
meeting held on January 17, 2003 and by the stockholders of the Fund at the
Fund's April 23, 2003 annual meeting of stockholders, as required by the 1940
Act.

In September 2003, Fahnestock & Co. Inc. changed its name to Oppenheimer & Co.
Inc. and Fahnestock Viner Holdings Inc. changed its name to Oppenheimer Holdings
Inc.

The Fund pays each of its directors who is not a director, officer or employee
of the Investment Manager, the Country Adviser or the Administrator or any

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

NOTE D: FOREIGN INCOME TAX

The Fund conducts its investment activities in India as a tax resident of
Mauritius and expects to obtain benefits under the double taxation treaty
between Mauritius and India (the "tax treaty" or "treaty"). To obtain benefits
under the double taxation treaty, the Fund must meet certain tests and
conditions, including the establishment of Mauritius tax residence and related
requirements. The Fund has obtained a certificate from the Mauritian authorities
that it is a resident of Mauritius under the double taxation treaty between
Mauritius and India. Under current regulations, a fund which is a tax resident
in Mauritius under the treaty, but has no branch or permanent establishment in
India, will not be subject to capital gains tax in India on the sale of
securities or to tax on dividends paid by Indian companies. The Fund is subject
to and accrues Indian withholding tax on interest earned on Indian securities at
the rate of 20.5%.

The Fund will, in any year that it has taxable income for Mauritius tax
purposes, elect to pay tax on its net income for Mauritius tax purposes at any
rate between 0% and 35%.

In March 2000, the Indian tax authorities issued an assessment order ("March
2000 Assessment Order") with respect to the Fund's Indian income tax return
filed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 which denied the benefits of the
tax treaty between India and Mauritius. In the March 2000 Assessment Order, the
Indian tax authorities held that the Fund is not a resident of Mauritius and
assessed tax on the dividend income for the year ended March 31, 1997 at the
rate of 20%, instead of the 15% rate claimed by the Fund under the tax treaty
between India and Mauritius. Similar assessment orders were issued to several
other mutual fund companies relying on the tax treaty between India and
Mauritius. On April 13, 2000, the Central Board of Direct Taxes ("CBDT") of the
Ministry of Finance in India issued a circular ("Circular 789") "clarifying" its
position on Indian taxation under the tax treaty between India and Mauritius
that, wherever a certificate of residence is issued by the Mauritian
authorities, such certificate will constitute sufficient evidence for accepting
the status of residence as well as beneficial ownership for applying the tax
treaty between India and Mauritius. The Fund, relying on Circular 789 and in
absence of a rectification order from the assessing officer, filed an appeal
against the March 2000 Assessment Order with the Indian tax authorities. There
have been several hearings and the Fund is awaiting an appellate judgment. On
October 7, 2003, the Indian Supreme Court upheld Circular 789 and the Fund's
right to take advantage of the tax treaty between India and Mauritius.

The Fund continues to: (i) comply with the requirements of the tax treaty
between India and Mauritius; (ii) be a tax resident of Mauritius; and (iii)
maintain that its central management and control resides in Mauritius and
therefore management believes that the Fund will be able to obtain the benefits
of the tax treaty between India and Mauritius. Accordingly, no provision for
Indian income taxes has been made in accompanying financial statements of the
Fund. Although the Fund expects to


                                                                              19

obtain the benefits of the treaty for the tax year ended March 31, 1997, the
Fund has not yet received notification of a repeal of the assessment order
issued.

The foregoing is based upon current interpretation and practice and is subject
to future changes in Indian or Mauritian tax laws and in the treaty between
India and Mauritius.

NOTE E: CAPITAL STOCK

In February 2003, the Board of Directors approved, subject to stockholder
approval, a fundamental policy whereby the Fund would adopt an "interval fund"
structure pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. Stockholders of the Fund were to approve the policy at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders held on April 23, 2003, however the proposal was
adjourned and later approved on April 30, 2003. As an interval fund, the Fund
makes semi-annual repurchase offers at net asset value (less a 2% repurchase
fee) to all Fund stockholders. The percentage of outstanding shares that the
Fund can repurchase in each offer is established by the Fund's Board of
Directors shortly before the commencement of each semi-annual offer, and is
between 5% and 25% of the Fund's then-outstanding shares.

THE INDIA FUND, INC.

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONCLUDED)                            (UNAUDITED)

NOTE F: CONCENTRATION OF RISKS

At June 30, 2004, substantially all of the Fund's net assets were invested in
Indian securities. The Indian securities markets are among other things
substantially smaller, less developed, less liquid, subject to less regulation
and more volatile than the securities markets in the United States.
Consequently, and as further discussed above, acquisitions and dispositions of
securities by the Fund involve special risks and considerations not present with
respect to U.S. securities. At June 30, 2004, the Fund has a concentration of
its investment in computer, finance, and petroleum related industries. The
values of such investments may be affected by changes in such industry sectors.

NOTE G: INDEMNIFICATION

Under the Fund's agreements, its officers and directors are indemnified agents
against certain liability arising out of the performance of their duties to the
Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts with their vendors and others that provide general indemnifications.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Fund. However, based on
experience, the Fund's management expects the risk of loss to be remote.

NOTE H: SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On June 22, 2004, the Fund filed an initial registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a possible rights offering to be
conducted by the Fund. The Fund will issue to stockholders of record as of a
date to be determined one right for each share of common stock held. The rights
will not be transferable and, consequently, will not be listed in any exchange.
The rights will entitle holders to subscribe for additional shares of the Fund's
common stock at a subscription price per share equal to 95% of the Fund's net
asset value per share on the expiration date of the offer. Holders will be able
to purchase one share of common stock for every three rights held. The terms of
the rights offering will be set forth in a prospectus to be delivered to
shareholders of record as of the record date for such rights offering.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund intends to distribute annually to shareholders substantially all of its
net investment income, and to distribute any net realized capital gains at least
annually. Net investment income for this purpose is income other than net
realized long and short-term capital gains net of expenses.

Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders whose shares of Common Stock are registered in their own names will
be deemed to have elected to have all distributions automatically reinvested by
the Plan Agent in Fund shares pursuant to the Plan, unless such shareholders
elect to receive distributions in cash. Shareholders who elect to receive
distributions in cash will receive all distributions in cash paid by check in
dollars mailed directly to the shareholder by the dividend paying agent. In the
case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees, that hold shares for
others who are beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the
basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the shareholders as
representing the total amount registered in such shareholders' names and held
for the account of beneficial owners that have not elected to receive
distributions in cash. Investors that own shares registered in the name of a
bank, broker or other nominee should consult with such nominee as to
participation in the Plan through such nominee, and may be required to have
their shares registered in their own names in order to participate in the Plan.

The Plan Agent serves as agent for the shareholders in administering the Plan.
If the directors of the Fund declare an income dividend or a capital gains
distribution payable either in the Fund's Common Stock or in cash,
nonparticipants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund or purchased by the Plan Agent in
the open market, as provided below. If the market price per share on the
valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per share on that date, the
Fund will issue new shares to participants at net asset value; provided,
however, that if the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price on
valuation date, then such shares will be issued at 95% of the market price. The
valuation date will be the dividend or distribution payment date or, if that
date is not a New York Stock Exchange trading day, the next preceding trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time, or
if the Fund should declare an income dividend or capital gains distribution
payable only in cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for the participants, buy
Fund shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for
the participants' accounts on, or shortly after, the payment date. If, before
the Plan Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net
asset value of a Fund share, the average per share purchase price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the distribution had been paid in shares
issued by the Fund on the dividend payment date.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (CONTINUED)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

Because of the forgoing difficulty with respect to open market purchases, the
Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend
amount in open-market purchases during the purchase period or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent
will cease making open-market purchases and shareholders will receive the
uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at the close of
business on the last purchase date.

Participants have the option of making additional cash payments to the Plan
Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for investment in the Fund's
Common Stock. The Plan Agent will use all such funds received from participants
to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about February 15.

Any voluntary cash payment received more than 30 days prior to this date will be
returned by the Plan Agent, and interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
payment. To avoid unnecessary cash accumulations, and also to allow ample time
for receipt and processing by the Plan Agent, it is suggested that participants
send in voluntary cash payments to be received by the Plan Agent approximately
ten days before an applicable purchase date specified above. A participant may
withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written notice, if the notice is received
by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmations of all transactions in an account, including information
needed by shareholders for personal and tax records. Shares in the account of
each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Agent in the name of the
participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares purchased
pursuant to the Plan.

There is no charge to participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gains
distributions or voluntary cash payments. The Plan Agent's fees for the
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions and voluntary cash
payments will be paid by the Fund. There will be no brokerage charges with
respect to shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of dividends or
capital gains distributions payable either in stock or in cash. However, each
participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions and voluntary cash
payments made by the participant. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts
of stock for individual accounts through the Plan are expected to be less than
the usual brokerage charges for such transactions, because the Plan Agent will
be purchasing stock for all participants in blocks and prorating the lower
commissions thus attainable.


                                                                              25

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (CONCLUDED)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The receipt of dividends and distributions under the Plan will not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes in the Plan are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan
as applied to any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution
paid subsequent to notice of the termination sent to members of the Plan at
least 30 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended by the Fund or the Plan Agent, but (except when necessary or
appropriate to comply with applicable law, rules or policies of a regulatory
authority) only by at least 30 days' written notice to participants in the Plan.
All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
P.O. Box 43027, Westborough, Massachusetts 43027.

         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal
         half-year (the  registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an
