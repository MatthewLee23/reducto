The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy of
shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder
reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or
post office box address. This practice is often called "householding" and it
helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

The Fund will file a schedule of its portfolio holdings on Form N-Q with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for the first and third quarters
of each fiscal year. The Fund's Form N-Q will be available on the Eaton Vance
website www.eatonvance.com, by calling Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122 or in the
EDGAR database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Form N-Q may also be
reviewed and copied at the SEC's public reference room in Washington, D.C. (call
1-800-732-0330 for information on the operation of the public reference room).

From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
procedures and information on how the Fund or Portfolio voted proxies relating
to portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30 without charge,
upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This description is also available on

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST as of November 30, 2004
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]

Thomas J. Fetter
President

The municipal bond market is a center of capital formation for states,
municipalities and, in some cases, private economic initiatives. In this edition
of our continuing educational series, we will discuss industrial development
revenue (IDR) bonds. IDR bonds have long been used as a financing mechanism by
local governments to provide assistance to local employers and encourage job
retention and creation within their communities.

IDR BONDS FINANCE PRIVATE ACTIVITIES THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC...

IDR bonds are issued by municipal authorities to finance projects and facilities
used by private corporations. Historically, IDR bonds have represented a
partnership between the private and public sectors - a source of dedicated
funding for companies and a source of job creation in projects beneficial to
local communities. The "Private-Activities" provision of the Tax Reform Act of
1986 permits issuance of tax-exempt bonds for specific activities, including
pollution control; gas and electric service; water distribution; wastewater
systems; solid waste disposal; airports and selected transportation projects;
and other industrial projects.

The Act also placed a cap on the dollar amount that may be raised for IDR bonds
in each state, limiting the amount to $50 per person/per state/per year, with a
$150 million maximum. These limitations provide protection against potential
abuse and ensure that tax-exempt IDR bonds will indeed be issued for projects
that will benefit the public.

IDR BONDS FINANCE UTILITY-RELATED PROJECTS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL INITIATIVES...

Typically, IDR bond projects provide financing for manufacturing, processing or
utility facilities. Historically, about one-half of these bonds have been issued
to finance pollution control facilities for manufacturers and electric
utilities. As many utilities and manufacturers have been ordered to comply with
stricter environmental and fuel standards, pollution control bonds have helped
finance the retrofits of existing plants. Other IDR bonds have served as
inducements from state and local issuers to locate plants or build new
facilities, in the hope that such construction might generate further economic
growth for a community.

IDR BONDS ARE SECURED BY CORPORATE REVENUES - NOT THOSE OF STATE OR LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS...

IDR bond issues are secured by the credit of the underlying corporation. The
municipal issuing authority acts solely as a conduit to permit tax-exempt
financing. The corporation pledges to make payments sufficient to meet all debt
service obligations. Unlike some revenue issues, IDR bonds are backed by
revenues of the entire corporation, not solely by those of the project being
financed.

Because IDR bonds are backed by corporate revenues and not by the taxing
authority of a state or local jurisdiction, they have historically provided
coupon premiums above those of general obligations and other more traditional
revenue bonds. Bonds may be either collateralized or unsecured. Collateralized
bonds have a lien against the company's assets, which may provide bond holders
enhanced bargaining power in the event of a bankruptcy. Unsecured bonds have no
such lien.

WHILE PROVIDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES, IDR BONDS REQUIRE RIGOROUS ANALYSIS...

While IDR bonds may provide unusual investment opportunities, they also may
entail increased risk, and therefore, demand especially intensive analysis. At
Eaton Vance, we have credit analysts and resources dedicated to IDR bond
research.

IDR bonds represent a key segment of the municipal bond market and should remain
an important source of capital formation. In our view, the experience and
resources needed to evaluate these issues further demonstrates the value of
professional management. We will continue to look for opportunities in this
sector of the municipal market.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          /s/ Thomas J. Fetter
                                          Thomas J. Fetter
                                          President

THE TRUST

PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST YEAR

- - Based on share price (traded on the New York Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
  total return of 12.54% for the year ended November 30, 2004. That return was
  the result of an increase in share price from $15.55 on November 30, 2003, to
  $16.15 on November 30, 2004, and the reinvestment of $1.19 per share in
  regular monthly dividends.(1)

- - Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 7.28% for the year
  ended November 30, 2004. That return was the result of a decrease in net asset
  value per share from $14.09 on November 30, 2003, to $13.95 on November 30,
  2004, and the reinvestment of $1.19 per share in regular monthly dividends.

- - Based on the last dividend of the fiscal year and a share price of $16.15, the
  Trust had a market yield of 7.37% at November 30, 2004.(2) The Trust's market
  yield is equivalent to a taxable yield of 11.34%.(3)

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - The expansion of the U.S. economy continued throughout the year ended November
  30, 2004, bolstered by a stronger-than-expected third quarter GDP and the
  brighter employment picture that emerged at the end of the fiscal year. One
  key economic factor during the period, however, was the surge in gasoline and
  energy prices, which raised fears that inflation could re-emerge. Amid those
  concerns, the Federal Reserve Bank increased its benchmark Federal Funds
  interest rate four times between June and November of 2004.

- - Following a strong rally in the first half of the year, the municipal bond
  market lost some momentum in the second half, as inflation remained a concern
  for fixed-income investors. For the year ended November 30, 2004, the Lehman
  Brothers Municipal Bond Index had a total return of 4.07%.(4)

- - We are pleased to announce that, as of September 13, 2004, William H. Ahern
  has joined the Trust's management team. Mr. Ahern joined Eaton Vance in 1989
  as an analyst in the fixed-income department and was named a Portfolio Manager
  in 1993. He serves as Portfolio Manager of 10 Eaton Vance tax-exempt mutual
  funds, closed-end funds for eight states, as well as several other Eaton Vance
  funds.

- - Insured* transportation bonds constituted the Trust's largest sector weighting
  at November 30, 2004. These issues have financed key projects within the
  nation's air and highway transportation infrastructure. The Trust's holdings
  included issues that financed projects for the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas,
  International Airport and for the Las Vegas, Nevada, monorail system.

- - Hospital bonds were prominent holdings in the Trust. Given stricter Medicare
  reimbursements and intense industry competition, management focused on
  institutions we believe have sound financial structures and good management
  and are well-positioned in their local markets.

- - At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
  36% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust is leveraged through the issuance
  of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
  increased income, but, at the same time, creates special risks (including the
  likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common
  shares).

  * Private insurance does not remove the risk of loss of principal associated
    with insured investments.

    THE VIEWS EXPRESSED THROUGHOUT THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO
    MANAGERS AND ARE CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS
    STATED ON THE COVER. THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED
    UPON MARKET OR OTHER CONDITIONS, AND THE INVESTMENT ADVISER DISCLAIMS ANY
    RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH VIEWS. THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS
    INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON MANY
    FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF
    OF ANY EATON VANCE FUND.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) A portion of the Trust's income may be subject to federal income tax and/or
    federal alternative minimum tax. Income may be subject to state tax.

(2) The Trust's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent dividend
    per share by the share price at the end of the period and annualizing the
    result.

(3) Taxable-equivalent yield assumes maximum 35.0% federal income tax rate. A
    lower rate would result in a lower tax-equivalent figure.

(4) It is not possible to invest directly in an Index. The Index's total return
    does not reflect the commissions or expenses that would have been incurred
    if an investor individually purchased or sold the securities represented in
    the Index.

The Trust invests primarily in debt securities issued by municipalities. The
ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their obligations may be
affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality. In
order to reduce the risk associated with such economic developments, at November
30, 2004, 32.3% of the securities in the portfolio of investments are backed by
bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial guaranty
assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an individual financial
institution ranged from 3.7% to 14.8% of total investments.

(1)  Security has been issued as a leveraged inverse floater bond. The stated
     interest rate represents the rate in effect at November 30, 2004

(2)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
     1933. These securities may be sold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. At November 30,
     2004, the aggregate value of the securities is $54,614,807 or 23.1% of the
     Trust's net assets.

(3)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
     requirements on open financial futures contracts.

(4)  Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond. The stated interest
     rate represents the rate in effect at November 30, 2004

(5)  Defaulted bond.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST as of November 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The
Trust was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an
Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated December 10, 1998. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal
income tax by investing primarily in investment grade municipal obligations.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
valuations furnished by a pricing service. Taxable obligations, if any, for
which price quotations are readily available are normally valued at the mean
between the latest bid and asked prices. Futures contracts and options on
futures contracts listed on commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement
prices. Over-the-counter options on futures contracts are normally valued at the
mean between the latest bid and asked prices. Interest rate swaps are normally
valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a broker. Short-term obligations,
maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
value. Investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or
at the direction of the Trustees.

B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after the
transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market fluctuations
during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed delivery purchases
are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to segregate assets in a
separate account, with a current value at least equal to the amount of its
purchase commitments.

C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount.

D FEDERAL INCOME TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, if any, and
tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At November 30, 2004,
the Trust, for federal income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of
$34,626,951 which will reduce the taxable income arising from future net
realized gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal
Revenue Code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions to shareholders
which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trust of any liability for
federal income or excise tax. Such capital loss carryover will expire on
November 30, 2007 ($9,497,591), November 30, 2008 ($14,623,294), November 30,
2009 ($5,266,337), November 30, 2011 ($2,541,236) and November 30, 2012
($2,698,493). In addition, the Trust intends to satisfy conditions which will
enable it to designate distributions from the interest income generated by its
investments in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal
income taxes when received by the Trust, as exempt-interest dividends. The
portion of such interest, if any, earned on private activity bonds issued after
August 7, 1986, may be considered a tax preference item for investors.

E FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
contract, the Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
received by the Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for book
purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust. The Trust's investment in
financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against anticipated
future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should interest rates
move unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

F OPTIONS ON FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the purchase of a put option on
a financial futures contract by the Trust, the premium paid is recorded as an
investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
option expires, the Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the
option. When the Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, the Trust will
realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales

                                       13
<Page>

proceeds from the closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of
the option. When the Trust exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash.
The risk associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium
originally paid.

G INTEREST RATE SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into interest rate swap agreements
to enhance return, to hedge against fluctuations in securities prices or
interest rates or as substitution for the purchase or sale of securities.
Pursuant to these agreements, the Trust makes semi-annual payments at a fixed
interest rate. In exchange, the Trust receives payments based on the interest
rate of a benchmark industry index. During the term of the outstanding swap
agreement, changes in the underlying value of the swap are recorded as
unrealized gains and losses. Payments received or made at the end of a
measurement period are recorded as realized gains and losses. The value of the
swap is determined by changes in the relationship between two rates of interest.
The Trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap
counterparty. However, the Trust does not anticipate non-performance by the
counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value of
interest rates.

H USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

I INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers
and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to the Trust, and shareholders are
indemnified against personal liability for obligations of the Trust.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into agreements
with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The Trust's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.

J EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as custodian
of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a fee reduced by
credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance the Trust
maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the Trust's custodian
fees are reported as a reduction of total expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

The Trust issued 2,620 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,620
shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on March 1, 1999 in a public
offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as a
reduction of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on the APS, which
accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering of
the APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction. Effective
July 8, 2003, a special dividend period of 733 days was set on the series A
shares. The dividend rate, which matures on July 12, 2005, is 1.25%. Dividend
rates ranged from 0.45% to 1.70% for Series B Shares, during the year ended
November 30, 2004. Series A and Series B are identical in all respects except
for the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price equal
to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a redemption
price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if the
Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset maintenance requirements
with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in an
amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a class
have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the
holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting rights of one vote
per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a separate class, have the
right to elect at least two members of the Board of Trustees. The APS have a
liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. The Trust is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect
to the APS as defined in the Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of
1940. The Trust pays an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares'
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income, after
payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to preferred
shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of

                                       14
<Page>

each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
Shares is generally seven days. Effective July 8, 2003, the Series A shares set
a special dividend period of 733 days. The applicable dividend rate for the
Auction Preferred Shares on November 30, 2004 was 1.25% and 1.70%, for Series A
and Series B Shares, respectively. For the year ended November 30, 2004, the
Trust paid dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $831,226 and
$683,148 for Series A and Series B Shares, respectively, representing an average
APS dividend rate for such period of 1.25% and 1.05%, respectively.

The Trust distinguishes between distribution on a tax basis and a financial
reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and
profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of capital.
Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to distributions
are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate primarily to the
method for amortizing premiums.

The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended November 30, 2004
and November 30, 2003 was as follows:

</Table>

During the year ended November 30, 2004, accumulated undistributed net
investment income was decreased by $156,112, and accumulated net realized loss
was decreased by $156,112 primarily due to differences between book and tax
accounting for amortization and accretion on debt securities. This change had no
effect on the net assets or the net asset value per share.

As of November 30, 2004, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk
in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures contracts
and interest rate swaps and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk
in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The
notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment
the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not
necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement
of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all
related and offsetting transactions are considered. A summary of obligations
under these financial instruments at November 30, 2004 is as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS
OF EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Eaton
Vance Municipal Income Trust (the Trust), including the portfolio of
investments, as of November 30, 2004, and the related statement of operations
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities held as of November 30, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights, referred to
above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Municipal Income Trust as of November 30, 2004, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for the

distributions paid to your account in calendar 2004. Shareholders are advised to
consult their own tax adviser with respect to the tax consequences of their
investment in the Trust. As required by the Internal Revenue Code regulations,

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC, Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

                                         ==================================================
</Table>

(1)  Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
     related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
     audit fees and specifically include fees for the performance of certain
     agreed-upon procedures relating to the registrant's auction preferred
     shares.
(2)  Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services
     rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax
     advice, and tax planning.
(3)  All other fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for products and
     services provided by the principal accountant other than audit,
     audit-related, and tax services.

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its
pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies
(i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services
determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate
specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,

<Page>

including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies,
it must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services
pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrant's audit
committee at least annually. The registrant's audit committee maintains full
responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of
the registrant's principal accountant.

(e)(2) No services described in paragraphs (b)-(d) above were approved by the
registrant's audit committee pursuant to the "de minimis exception" set forth in

(f) Not applicable.

(g) The following table presents (i) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees
for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed for services rendered to the

and other services) billed for services rendered to the Eaton Vance organization
for the registrant's last two fiscal years.

</Table>

(1) Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the
registrant's investment adviser and administrator.

(h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether the provision by the
registrant's principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Norton H. Reamer (Chair), Samuel L. Hayes, III, William H.
Park and Lynn A. Stout are the members of the registrant's audit committee.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

ITEM 8. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not Applicable.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) It is the conclusion of the registrant's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer that the effectiveness of the registrant's current
disclosure controls and procedures (such disclosure controls and procedures
having been evaluated within 90 days of the date of this filing) provide
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the
registrant has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified in the Commission's rules and forms and that the information
required to be disclosed by the registrant has been accumulated and communicated
to the registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
in order to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the registrant's internal controls over
financial reporting during the period that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
