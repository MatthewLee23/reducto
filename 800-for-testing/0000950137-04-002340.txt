Item 1. Reports to Shareholders.

The Trust's semi-annual report transmitted to shareholders pursuant to Rule
30e-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is as follows:

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this report, you'll learn about how your investment in Van Kampen
       Senior Income Trust performed during the semi-annual period. The
       portfolio management team will provide an overview of the market
       conditions and discuss some of the factors that affected investment
       performance during the reporting period. In addition, this report
       includes the trust's financial statements and a list of trust investments
       as of January 31, 2004.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment
       objective. The trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and,
       therefore, the value of the trust shares may be less than what you paid
       for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.

As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the

the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share
market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust
at a given time. Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors,
including supply and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an
investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for
the period in accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
of all shares at the end of the period.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2004

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust is managed by the adviser's Senior Loans team,
led by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The six months ended January 31, 2004 were highly favorable for the senior-loan
market. Corporations continued to exhibit strong financial performance, with
marked improvement in balance sheets across most industries. In spite of limited
top-line revenue growth, companies were generally able to reap the benefits of
rising productivity, lower operating costs and low interest rates to boost
profitability. Market leaders were typically those companies that had
proactively restructured their businesses to thrive in an era of lower prices
and greater global competition.

These positive financial results formed the backdrop for a period of strong
performance in both the senior-loan market and its sibling, the high-yield
market. Yield spreads contracted over much of the period, which enabled many
companies to access the senior-loan market at the best terms since 1999. The
market was further boosted by an increase in demand, much of which came from
institutional investors drawn to the attractive yields and improving credit
quality. This was especially evident in the last two months of the period, when
investors began accepting issuance from companies with slightly higher debt
ratios than had previously been the case. The surge of interest in the asset
class led to the easy absorption of the healthy supply of new issuance during
the period.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

A closed-end fund's return can be calculated based upon either the market price
or the net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by
dividing the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets,
less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while
market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns

can differ significantly. On a market-price basis, the trust returned 13.65
percent. On an NAV basis, the trust returned 8.11 percent.

We remained focused on maintaining a high level of diversification in the
trust's portfolio during the period in order to minimize the risk of
over-concentration in any one sector or security. While we follow a bottom-up
security-selection process and generally do not practice sector rotation, we did
move to limit the portfolio's exposure to certain industries facing ongoing
challenges. For example, we found the textile industry particularly unappealing
given the growing occurrence of import substitution, and we limited the trust's
holdings in this sector. We avoided the auto industry because we believe that
with the industry's continuing re-structuring, weaknesses may become evident
throughout the supply chain. We followed a similar path in telecommunications,
where ongoing problems with overcapacity have yet to be resolved.

Through thorough fundamental research, we identified issuers in several sectors
that offered what we believed to be compelling value relative to our assessment
of their financial prospects. Within the cable industry, for example, prices
remained depressed throughout much of the period in the wake of the Adelphia
reorganization. Our analysis indicated that the market was not properly pricing
the underlying strength of the cable business model. By investing in the
companies' senior secured debt, we were able to capitalize on these pricing
opportunities from a somewhat protected standpoint, relative to investors in
traditional high-yield bonds.

The trust also benefited during the period from our use of leverage. We use
leverage on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance the trust's overall
returns.

To implement this approach, the trust borrows and invests at interest rates that
roughly track current market rates. As a result, this approach minimizes the
risks inherent in traditional leveraged strategies (which exploit the difference
between short- and long-term interest rates), especially in periods of rising
interest rates, and can help boost returns.

The number of issuers in the portfolio that are in default (defined here as
those not paying principal and/or interest as contractually obligated) has
declined by approximately 20 percent since the beginning of the period. The
process of working out previous defaults had left the portfolio with equity
holdings in several companies. We took advantage of rising prices over the
course of the period to sell several of these holdings and reinvested the
proceeds into interest-bearing notes.

    incentives for a Borrower to prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the
    Trust's portfolio may occur. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of
    Senior Loans held in the Trust's portfolio may be substantially less than
    the stated maturities shown. Although the Trust is unable to accurately
    estimate the actual remaining maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust
    estimates that the actual average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its
    portfolio will be approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

*  If certain expenses had not been voluntarily assumed by Van Kampen, total
   return would have been lower and the Ratio of Operating Expenses to Average
   Net Assets and the Ratio of Net Investment Income to Average Net Assets would
   have been 1.21% and 6.90% for the period ended July 31, 1998.

** Non-Annualized

(a)Net asset value on June 24, 1998 of $10.00 is adjusted for common share
   offering costs of $.013.

(b)Total return based on common share market price assumes an investment at the
   common share market price at the beginning of the period indicated,
   reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
   Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the closing
   common share market price at the end of the period indicated.

(c)Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
   variable rate senior loan interest.

(d)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   Borrowings) from the Trust's total assets and dividing by the total number of
   senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
   indebtedness.

(e)As required, effective August 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
   the year ended July 31, 2002 was to decrease the ratio of net investment
   income to average net asset applicable to common shares by .01%. Net
   investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gains and losses
   per share were unaffected by the adjustments. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for the periods prior to July 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

N/A--Not Applicable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

January 31, 2004 (Unaudited)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of
current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust seeks to
achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of interests in
floating or variable rate senior loans to corporations, partnerships and other
entities which operate in a variety of industries and geographical regions. The
Trust borrows money for investment purposes which will create the opportunity
for enhanced return, but also should be considered a speculative technique and
may increase the Trust's volatility. The Trust commenced investment operations
on June 24, 1998. Effective November 30, 2003, the Trust's investment adviser,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. merged into its affiliate, Van Kampen Asset
Management.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans are valued by the Trust following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Trust's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate, interest rate
redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the
current interest rate, the period until next interest rate redetermination and
the maturity of such Senior Loan. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Trust's Valuation Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

NOTES TO

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility
fees received are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan,
note, or other fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of
amendment fees which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as
compensation for agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2003, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $179,582,840, which will expire between July 31, 2009 and
2011.

    At January 31, 2004, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

                                                                              33

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $2,873,430
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the six months ended January 31, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $67,000 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of
the Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under a Legal Services agreement, the Adviser provides legal services to the
Trust. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to each Trust. For the
six months ended January 31, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $23,300 representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its
affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the
Trust, which are reported as "Legal" expenses in the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to deter all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement

party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,

I, John L. Sullivan, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Senior Income
Trust;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were
made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and cash
flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement of cash
flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and
have:

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
during the period in which this report is being prepared;

[b)  Omitted.]

c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to
the filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an
annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial information; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal controls over
financial reporting.
