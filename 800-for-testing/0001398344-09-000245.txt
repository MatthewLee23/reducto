The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's investment objective is long-term capital
appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political, structural
and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin, which
include, among others, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the
Dominican Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica,
Panama, Colombia, the United States and Venezuela ("Caribbean Basin Countries").
The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in equity and equity-linked
securities of issuers, including U.S-based companies which engage in substantial
trade with, and derive substantial revenue from, operations in the Caribbean
Basin Countries.

                                Portfolio Manager

February 5, 2009

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

We are pleased to present our semiannual report for the period ended December
31, 2008.

The global slowdown has continued to create a challenging investment environment
for the Fund. Although oil prices have collapsed from historic 2008 summer
highs, global demand for the goods and services has been drastically reduced.
Both developed and emerging markets, including the Caribbean Basin, have
faltered severely, and nearly all of our holdings have been negatively impacted
in some way by the drop in global demand.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund's net asset value was $4.79 per share, which
represents a loss of 31.7% for the six month period then ended (adjusted for
distributions). The Fund's share price closed the year at $4.20, down from $7.69
per share on June 30, 2008, and representing a 43.1% loss for the six month
period (adjusted for distributions). A year-end distribution of $0.211 per share
was paid on January 5, 2009, to shareholders of record December 12, 2008.

Our investment focus remains two-fold: first, to invest in companies which we
feel will benefit from a resumption of trade with Cuba; second, to concentrate
on Caribbean Basin companies which we believe have good prospects even if there
is no change in U.S. policy towards Cuba.

Many of the companies best poised to experience significant growth from the
eventual normalization of relations with Cuba are service-based companies,
specifically in the leisure sector which has been especially hard hit. With the
Obama administration taking office, we anticipate that some immediate changes
will take place in

U.S.-Cuba policy. We are confident that an early step of the new administration
will be to relax restrictions on cash remittances and family travel by Cuban
Americans to Cuba. To capitalize on this expected change, we added Western Union
(NYSE: WU) to the portfolio after the reporting period. We believe Western Union
is well positioned to benefit from the increase in remittance payments between
Cuban Americans and their relatives. We also are hopeful that one or more bills
in Congress will pass, expanding exports to Cuba during the Obama
administration. We are confident that when taken together, these progressive
steps, coupled with Fidel Castro's faltering health, will pave the way for a new
U.S.-Cuba policy that will lead to normalization of trade with Cuba. For now, we
continue to position the portfolio in a manner we believe will benefit from
these events as they transpire; for the future, we continue to explore
opportunities to invest directly in Cuba, when it is legally permitted.

Our largest investment, Seaboard Corporation (NYSE: SEB), is an illustration of
a company we feel could do well even with no change in U.S. policy towards Cuba.
Besides operating containerized shipping service between the United States, the
Caribbean Basin, and Central and South America, Seaboard is also one of the
largest pork producers and processors in the United States. We feel that the
company's business mix will outperform even in the current bearish environment.

In November, 2008, Erik Herzfeld was formally appointed as a Portfolio Manager
of the Fund. Erik, my son, joined Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc. in February,
2007 and has worked closely with me, researching investment opportunities in the
Caribbean. He completed his undergraduate work in Economics and Mathematics at
Johns Hopkins University and received his MS from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Sloan School of Management. Before joining the advisor, he worked in
quantitative research and trading roles with both Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan,
where he served as a Vice President in New York and Asia. He brings his
expertise in emerging markets and extensive knowledge of closed-end funds to his
new role with the Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
================================================================================

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION AND RELATED MATTERS
- --------------------------------

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January, 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The
Fund pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country (collectively, "Caribbean Basin
Companies"). Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its total
assets in equity and equity-linked securities of Caribbean Basin Companies. The
Fund's investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed without the
approval of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At December 31, 2008, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and Panama, representing approximately 26.03% and 8.85% of
the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is State Street Bank and Trust Company
("SSBT"), 200 Clarendon Street, PO Box 9130, Boston, Massachusetts 02117.

SECURITY VALUATION
- ------------------

The Fund adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"
("SFAS No. 157"), effective January 1, 2008. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value is
defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.

In determining fair value, the Fund uses various valuation approaches. SFAS No.
157 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value
that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when
available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Fund. Unobservable inputs reflect the Fund's assumptions
about


                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
================================================================================

the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair
value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:

Level 1:    quoted prices in active markets for identical investments
Level 2:    other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
            similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
            etc.)
Level 3:    significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
            assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from
security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors including, the
type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the
marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the
extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more
judgment. Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that
may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that
cannot be reasonably determined. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the
values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed.
Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair
value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the
inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls,
is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market
participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market
assumptions are not readily available, the Fund's own assumptions are set to
reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability at the measurement date. The Fund uses prices and inputs that are
current as of the measurement date, including periods of market dislocation. In
periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be
reduced for many securities. This condition could cause a security to be
reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
================================================================================

The following table summarizes the valuation of the Fund's investments by the
above fair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2008:

      LEVEL     Investments in Securities   Other Financial Instruments
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      Level 1        $18,445,834                       $0
      Level 2             $0                           $0

* See Note 2, non-marketable securities owned

INCOME RECOGNITION
- ------------------

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign
securities, as soon as the Fund is notified, and interest income is recognized
on an accrual basis. Pursuant to a custodian agreement, SSBT receives a fee
reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance
the Fund maintains with SSBT. Credit balances used to reduce the Fund's
custodian fees for the six months ended December 31, 2008, were approximately
$26. Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized over the
life of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include the
portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments denominated
in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains and losses
on investments and foreign currency.

DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
- ------------------------------------

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -----------------------------------------------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
================================================================================

INCOME TAXES
- ------------

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS
- -----------------------------

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. For the six months ended December 31, 2008, a
distribution from long-term capital gains of $0.0494 per share and an income
distribution of $0.1616 per share was declared on November 11, 2008, payable on
January 5, 2009 to shareholders of record December 12, 2008. The distribution
was paid in stock, unless an election to receive cash was made by the
stockholder. Shares were issued at a reinvestment price of $4.9896 per share
which was the price paid by the fund to purchase the required number of shares
in the open market in order to pay the distribution.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES OWNED

Investments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of
Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds were listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A "regulatory halt" on
trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July, 1995 and trading in
the bonds was suspended as of December 28, 2006. The New York Stock Exchange has
stated that following the suspension of trading, application will be made to the
Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the issue. As of December 31, 2008,
the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which approximates the
bonds' fair value.

Investments in securities also include 45,000 shares of Xcelera, Inc. The
security traded on the Pink Sheets until the first quarter of 2007 when trading
was discontinued. As of December 31, 2008, the position was valued at $0 by the
Board of Directors, which approximates the position's fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total advisory fees for

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
================================================================================

REGISTERED HOLDERS ("STOCKHOLDERS") OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, $0.001 PAR VALUE
("COMMON STOCK") OF HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC. (THE "FUND") WILL
AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED ("PARTICIPANTS") IN THE FUND'S DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
PLAN (THE "PLAN") AND ARE ADVISED AS FOLLOWS:

1.    State Street Bank & Trust Company (the "Agent") will act as agent for each
      Participant. The Agent will open an account for each registered
      shareholder as a Participant under the Plan in the same name in which such
      Participant's shares of Common Stock are registered.

2.    CASH OPTION. Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock
      otherwise elects, all dividend and capital gains distributions payable in
      cash ("Distributions") will be automatically reinvested by the Agent in
      additional Common Stock of the Fund. Stockholders who elect not to
      participate in the Plan will receive all cash distributions in cash paid
      by check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the shares
      are held in street or other nominee name then to such nominee) by the
      Agent, as dividend paying agent. Stockholders and Participants may elect
      not to participate in the Plan and to receive all cash distributions of
      dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to the
      Agent, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.

3.    MARKET PREMIUM ISSUANCES. If on the payment date for a Distribution, the
      net asset value per Common Stock is equal to or less than the market price
      per Common Stock plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Agent shall
      receive newly issued Common Stock ("Additional Common Stock") from the
      Fund for each Participant's account. The number of Additional Common Stock
      to be credited shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
      Distribution by the greater of (i) the net asset value per Common Share on
      the payment date, or (ii) 95% of the market price per Common Share on the
      payment date.

4.    MARKET DISCOUNT PURCHASES. If the net asset value per Common Stock exceeds
      the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date
      for a Distribution, the Agent (or a broker-dealer selected by the Agent)
      shall endeavor to apply the amount of such Distribution on each
      Participant's Common Stock to purchase Common Stock on the open market. In
      the event of a market discount on the payment date, the Agent will have 30
      days after the dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest
      the dividend amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. The
      weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all Common
      Stock purchased by the Agent as Agent shall be the price per Common Stock
      allocable to each Participant. If, before the Agent has completed its
      purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions exceeds
      the net asset value of the Common Stock as of the payment date, the
      purchase price paid by Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Common
      Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common Stock than if such
      Distribution had been paid in Common Stock issued by the Fund. Because of
      the foregoing difficulty with respect to open-market purchases, the Plan
      provides that if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend
      amount in open-market purchases during the purchase period or

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONTINUED)
================================================================================

      if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase
      period, the Plan Agent may cease making open-market purchases and may
      invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued
      Common Stock at the net asset value per Common Stock at the close of
      business on the last purchase date. Participants should note that they
      will not be able to instruct the Agent to purchase Common Stock at a
      specific time or at a specific price. Open-market purchases may be made on
      any securities exchange where Common Stock are traded, in the
      over-the-counter market or in negotiated transactions, and may be on such
      terms as to price, delivery and otherwise as the Agent shall determine.
      Each Participant's uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear
      interest. The Agent shall have no liability in connection with any
      inability to purchase Common Stock within the time provided, or with the
      timing of any purchases effected. The Agent shall have no responsibility
      for the value of Common Stock acquired. The Agent may commingle
      Participants' funds to be used for open-market purchases of the Fund's
      shares and the price per share allocable to each Participant in connection
      with such purchases shall be the average price (including brokerage
      commissions and other related costs) of all Fund shares purchased by
      Agent. The rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
      may require the Agent to limit the Agent's market purchases or temporarily
      cease making market purchases for Participants.

5.    The market price of Common Stock on a particular date shall be the last
      sales price on the securities exchange where the Common Stock are listed
      on that date (currently the NASDAQ Capital Market)(the "Exchange"), or, if
      there is no sale on the Exchange on that date, then the average between
      the closing bid and asked quotations on the Exchange on such date will be
      used. The net asset value per Common Stock on, a particular date shall be
      the amount calculated on that date (or if not calculated on such date, the
      amount most recently calculated) by or on behalf of the Fund.

6.    Whenever the Agent receives or purchases shares or fractional interests
      for a Participant's account, the Agent will send such Participant a
      notification of the transaction as soon as practicable. The Agent will
      hold such shares and fractional interests as such Participant's agent and
      may hold them in the Agent's name or the name of the Agent's nominee. The
      Agent will not send a Participant stock certificates for shares unless a
      Participants so requests in writing or unless a Participant's account is
      terminated as stated below. The Agent will vote any shares so held for a
      Participant in accordance with any proxy returned to the Fund by such
      Participant in respect of the shares of which such Participant is the
      record holder.

7.    There is presently no service charge for the Agent serving as
      Participants' agent and maintaining Participants' accounts. The Agent may,
      however, charge Participants for extra services performed at their
      request. The Plan may be amended in the future to impose a service charge.
      In acting as Participants' agent under the Plan, the Agent shall be liable
      only for acts, omissions, losses, damages or expenses caused by the
      Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence. In addition, the Agent
      shall not be liable for any taxes, assessments or governmental charges
      which may be levied or assessed on any basis whatsoever in connection with
      the administration of the Plan.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONTINUED)
================================================================================

8.    The Agent may hold each Participant's Common Stock acquired pursuant to
      the Plan together with the Common Stock of other Stockholders of the Fund
      acquired pursuant to the Plan in non-certificated form in the Agent's name
      or that of the Agent's nominee. Each Participant will be sent a
      confirmation by the Agent of each acquisition made for his or her account
      as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days, after the date
      thereof. Upon a Participant's request, the Agent will deliver to the
      Participant, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the full
      Common Stock. Although each Participant may from time to time have an
      undivided fractional interest in a Common Share of the Fund, no
      certificates for a fractional share will be issued. Similarly,
      Participants may request to sell a portion of the Common Stock held by the
      Agent in their Plan accounts by calling the Agent, writing to the Agent,
      or completing and returning the transaction form attached to each Plan
      statement. The Agent will sell such Common Stock through a broker-dealer
      selected by the Agent within 5 business days of receipt of the request.
      The sale price will equal the weighted average price of all Common Stock
      sold through the Plan on the day of the sale, less brokerage commissions.
      Participants should note that the Agent is unable to accept instructions
      to sell on a specific date or at a specific price. Any share dividends or
      split shares distributed by the Fund on Common Stock held by the Agent for
      Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event that the
      Fund makes available to its Stockholders rights to purchase additional
      Common Stock, the Common Stock held for each Participant under the Plan
      will be added to other Common Stock held by the Participant in calculating
      the number of rights to be issued to each Participant.

      If a Participant holds more than one Common Stock Certificate registered
      in similar but not identical names or if more than one address is shown
      for a Participant on the Fund's records, all of such Participant's shares
      of Common Stock must be put into the same name and address if all of them
      are to be covered by one account. Additional shares subsequently acquired
      by a Participant otherwise than through the Plan will be covered by the
      Plan.

9.    The reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve Participants of any
      federal, state or local taxes which may be payable (or required to be
      withheld on Distributions.) Participants will receive tax information
      annually for their personal records and to help them prepare their federal
      income tax return. For further information as to tax consequences of
      participation in the Plan, Participants should consult with their own tax
      advisors.

10.   Each registered Participant may terminate his or her account under the
      Plan by notifying the Agent in writing at State Street Bank and Trust,
      P.O. Box 642, Boston, MA 021170642, or by calling the Agent at (617)
      937-6870. Such termination will be effective with respect to a particular
      Distribution if the Participant's notice is received by the Agent prior to
      such Distribution record date. The Plan may be terminated by the Agent or
      the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to each Participant at least 60
      days prior to the effective date of the termination. Upon any termination,
      the Agent will cause a certificate or certificates to be issued for the
      full shares held for each Participant under the Plan and cash adjustment
      for any fraction of a Common Share at the then current market value of the
      Common Shares to be delivered to him. If preferred, a Participant may
      request the sale of all of

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONTINUED)
================================================================================

      the Common Shares held by the Agent in his or her Plan account in order to
      terminate participation in the Plan. If any Participant elects in advance
      of such termination to have Agent sell part or all of his shares, Agent is
      authorized to deduct from the proceeds the brokerage commissions incurred
      for the transaction. If a Participant has terminated his or her
      participation in the Plan but continues to have Common Shares registered
      in his or her name, he or she may re-enroll in the Plan at any time by
      notifying the Agent in writing at the address above.

11.   These terms and conditions may be amended by the Agent or the Fund at any
      time but, except when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable
      law or the rules or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or
      any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each Participant
      appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date
      thereof. The amendment shall be deemed to be accepted by each Participant
      unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent receives notice of
      the termination of the Participant's account under the Plan. Any such
      amendment may include an appointment by the Agent of a successor Agent,
      subject to the prior written approval of the successor Agent by the Fund.

12.   These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      Maryland.

DISCUSSION REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
================================================================================

The Fund's Board of Directors including a majority of those directors who are
not "interested persons" as such term is defined in the 1940 Act ("Independent
Directors") unanimously approved the continuance of the investment advisory
agreement between the Fund and the Advisor (the "Agreement") at a meeting held
on August 12, 2008.

Before meeting to determine whether to approve the Agreement, the Board had the
opportunity to review written materials provided by the Advisor and by legal
counsel to the Fund which contained information to help the Board evaluate the
Agreement. The materials included (i) a memorandum from the Fund's legal counsel
regarding the Directors' responsibilities in evaluating and approving the
Agreement, (ii) a letter from the Advisor containing detailed information about
the Advisor's services to the Fund, Fund performance, allocation of Fund
transactions, compliance and administration information, and the compensation
received by the Advisor from the Fund; (iii) a copy of the current investment
advisory agreement between the Fund and the Advisor; (iv) audited financial
statements for the Advisor for the year-ended December 31, 2007 and unaudited
financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2008; (v) the Advisor's
Form ADV Parts I and II; (vi) comparative performance data for the Fund relative
to peer funds (small closedend funds and foreign funds invested in the Latin
American region); and (vii) comparative statistics and fee data for the Fund
relative to peer funds.

During its deliberations on whether to approve the continuance of the Agreement,
the Board considered many factors. The Board considered the nature, extent and
quality of the services to be provided by the Advisor and determined that such
services will meet the needs of the Fund and its shareholders. The Board
reviewed the services provided to the Fund by the Advisor as compared to
services provided by other advisors, which manage investment companies with
investment objectives, strategies and policies similar to those of the Fund. The
Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by
the Advisor were appropriate and consistent with the terms of the advisory
agreement, that the quality of those services had been consistent with industry
norms and that the Fund was likely to benefit from the continued provision of
those services. The Board also concluded that the Advisor had sufficient
personnel, with the appropriate education and experience, to serve the Fund
effectively and had demonstrated its continuing ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel.

Both at the meeting and on an ongoing basis throughout the year, the Board
considered and evaluated the investment performance of the Fund and reviewed the
Fund's performance relative to other investment companies and funds with similar
investment objectives, strategies and policies, and its respective benchmark
index. The Board considered both the short-term and long-term performance of the
Fund. They concluded that the performance of the Fund was within an acceptable
range of performance relative to other funds with similar investment objectives,
strategies and policies.

DISCUSSION REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
(CONTINUED)
================================================================================

The Board considered the costs of the services provided by the Advisor, the
compensation and benefits received by the Advisor providing services to the
Fund, as well as the Advisor's profitability. In addition, the Board considered
any direct or indirect revenues received by affiliates of the Advisor including
the commissions paid to the Fund's affiliated broker/dealer, Thomas J. Herzfeld
& Co., Inc. The Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor by the
Fund and relevant comparable fee data and statistics of a sampling of small
closed-end funds and foreign funds invested in the Latin American region. The
Board further discussed the services by the Advisor and concluded that the
advisory services performed were efficient and satisfactory and that the fee
charged was reasonable and not excessive. The Board concluded that the Advisor's
fees and profits derived from its relationship with the Fund in light of its
expenses, were reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services
provided, taking into account the fees charged by other advisors for managing
comparable funds with similar strategies. The Directors also concluded that the
overall expense ratio of the Fund was reasonable, taking into account the size
of the Fund, the quality of services provided by the Advisor, and the investment
performance of the Fund.

The Board also considered the extent to which economies of scale would be
realized relative to fee levels as the Fund grows, and whether the advisory fee
levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of shareholders. The
Board recognized that because of the closed-end structure of the Fund, and the
fact that there is no influx of capital, this particular factor is less relevant
to the Fund than it would be to an open-end fund. The Board concluded that only
marginal economies of scale could be achieved through the growth of assets since
the Fund is closed-ended.

The Board also considered its deliberations regarding the Advisor's services and
performance from the regular Board meetings held throughout the year, including
the Board's discussion of the Fund's investment objective, long-term
performance, investment style and process. The Board noted the high level of
diligence with which it reviews and evaluates the Advisor throughout the year
and the extensive information provided with respect to Advisor's performance and
the Fund's expenses on a quarterly basis. The Board also considered whether
there have occurred any events that would constitute a reason not to renew the
Agreement and concluded there were not.

After deliberation and further consideration of the factors discussed above and
information presented at the August 12, 2008 meeting and at previous meetings of
the Board, the Board and the Independent Directors determined to continue the
Agreement for an additional oneyear period. In arriving at this decision, the
Board and the Independent Directors did not identify any single matter, factor
or consideration as controlling, but made their determination in light of all
the circumstances. The Board based its decision to approve the Agreement on all
the relevant factors in light of its reasonable business judgment, and with a
view to future long-term considerations.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the stockholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors, where those
changes were implemented after the registrant last provided disclosure in
response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K
(17CFR229.407)(as required by Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR

internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.
