MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

General Market Performance
   The year 2003 was truly remarkable in many respects. The U.S. military
overturned Iraq's government in record-setting fashion; the U.S. economy staged
a surprising and robust rebound; the equity market surged, reasserting its
dominance over the bond market after three years of underperformance; credit
spreads experienced an unparalleled contraction after 5 years of widening; and
despite all the good news, the Federal Reserve lowered and held short-term
interest rates to a mere 1% even as Treasury yields drifted higher. On a
disturbing note, however, the dollar plunged, gold and commodity prices soared,
breakeven spreads on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) reached new
highs, and the Fed insisted repeatedly that these harbingers of rising
inflation were trumped by the economy's so-called excess capacity, thus, in our
view, officially sanctioning higher inflation for the first time in over 20
years. Non-government bonds thrived in this environment, as a stronger economy
boosted confidence in the overall outlook for earnings, and easy money gave
pricing power back to an increasing number of industries. Plus, the low level
of yields on Treasuries dramatically enhanced the appeal of the higher yields
available on corporate and high-yield debt. Mortgage-backed investors struggled
to cope with by far the most rapid pace of prepayments in history, but
fortunately the system survived an unprecedented bout of volatility in late
summer. Easy money and improving economic conditions also helped high-yield and
emerging-market debt markets to flourish.

Fund Performance
   With a strong emphasis on the BBB sector of the corporate bond market and a
secondary emphasis on emerging market and high-yield debt securities, the Fund
was favorably exposed to a friendly climate throughout the year. The Fund was
able to pay monthly dividends at an annualized rate of 8.5%, and its total
return (price gains/losses plus interest income, net of expenses) was 21.6% for
the year. For reference, the Lehman Brothers BAA Credit Index had a total
return of 11.9% for the year, and the Lehman High-Yield Index had a total
return of 20.0%. The fund's share price rose from $14.45 to $15.85 over the
course of the year.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in Thousands)

1. Significant Accounting Policies:
   Western Asset Premier Bond Fund (the "Fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund commenced investment operations on March 28, 2002.

   The Fund's investment objective is to provide current income and capital
appreciation by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of investment
grade bonds. The Fund currently seeks to achieve its investment objective by
investing substantially all of its assets in bonds, including corporate bonds,
U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-related securities. The
ability of the issuers of the securities held by the Fund to meet their
obligations might be affected by economic developments in a specific state,
industry or region.

   Preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by
the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

Security Valuation
   Securities owned by the Fund for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at current market value. Securities for which market
quotations are not readily available are fair valued by the Board of Trustees
or the Fund's Valuation Committee pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board.
In determining fair value, the Board of Trustees or the Fund's Valuation
Committee consider all relevant qualitative and quantitative information
available. The factors are subject to change over time and are reviewed
periodically. The values assigned to fair value investments are based on
available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might
ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future developments
inherent in long-term investments. Further, because of the inherent uncertainty
of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and
the differences could be material.

   Where a security is traded on more than one market, which may include
foreign markets, the securities are generally valued on the market considered
by the Fund's adviser to be the primary market. The Fund will value its foreign
securities in U.S. dollars on the basis of the then-prevailing exchange rates.

Security Transactions
   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from security transactions are reported on an identified cost basis for
both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

   Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term
investments, U.S. government securities and U.S. government agencies)
aggregated $74,220 and $92,594, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2003. There were purchases of $12,592 and sales of $2,077 of U.S. government
and government agency obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Foreign Currency Transactions
   Assets and liabilities initially expressed in terms of non-U.S. currencies
are translated into U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange. Purchases and
sales of securities and income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at
the prevailing market rates on the dates of such transactions. The effects of
changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates on investment securities and other
assets and liabilities are included with the net realized and unrealized gain
or loss on investment securities.

Repurchase Agreements
   The Fund may engage in repurchase agreements. Under the terms of a typical
repurchase agreement, a fund takes possession of an underlying debt obligation
subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and a fund to resell, the
obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the yield
during a fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate of
return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times equal to at least the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of a
counterparty default, a fund has the right to use the collateral to satisfy the
terms of the repurchase agreement. However, there could be a potential loss to
the fund in

                                      19

Annual Report to Shareholders

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
(Amounts in Thousands)

the event the fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its right to dispose
of the collateral securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the
value of the collateral securities during the period in which the fund seeks to
assert its rights. The Fund's investment adviser reviews the value of the
collateral and the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the
Fund enters into repurchase agreements to evaluate potential risks.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements
   The Fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements. Under the terms of a
typical reverse repurchase agreement, a fund sells an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation to repurchase the security from the buyer
at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the yield to the buyer
during the buyer's holding period. A reverse repurchase agreement involves the
risk, among others, that the market value of the securities the Fund has sold
and is obligated to repurchase exceed the cash collateral retained by the Fund.
In the event the buyer of the securities under a repurchase agreement files for
bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the Fund's use of the proceeds of the
agreement may be restricted pending a determination by the party, or its
trustee or receiver, whether to enforce the Fund's obligation to repurchase the
securities. At the time the Fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it
will segregate, on it books, liquid assets having a value at least equal to the
repurchase price or take other actions permitted by law to cover its
obligations. The Fund had no reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at
December 31, 2003.

Options, Futures and Swap Agreements
   The current market value of a traded option is the last sale price or, in
the absence of a sale, the mean between the closing bid and asked price.
Futures contracts are valued daily at the settlement price established by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Futures contracts are
marked-to-market on a daily basis. As a contract's value fluctuates, payments
known as variation margin are made or received by the Fund each day, depending
on the daily fluctuation in the value of the contract. The daily changes in
contract value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses, and the Fund
recognizes a gain or loss when the contract is closed. Swap agreements are
priced daily based upon quotations from brokers and the change, if any, is
recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.

Investment Income and Distributions to Common Shareholders
   Dividend income and distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Dividends from net investment income are declared and paid monthly to common
shareholders. Net capital gain distributions are declared and paid after the
end of the tax year in which the gain is realized. Distributions are determined
in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those
determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America; accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made
within the Funds' capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under federal income tax regulations. Interest income and expenses
are recorded on the accrual basis. Bond discounts and premiums are amortized
and included in interest income for financial reporting purposes and federal
income tax purposes.

Short Sales
   The Fund may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline in
the market price of that security. The Fund must then borrow the security sold
short and deliver it to the dealer that brokered the short sale. A gain,
limited to the price at which the security was sold short, or a loss,
potentially unlimited in size, will be recognized upon the termination of the
short sale. With respect to each short sale, the Fund must segregate collateral
consisting of liquid assets with a value at least equal to the current market
value of the shorted securities, marked-to-market daily or take other actions
permitted by law to cover its obligations. Dividend expenses and fees paid to
brokers to borrow securities in connection with short sales are considered part
of the cost of short sale transactions. The Fund had no open short sales at
December 31, 2003.

Reclassification of Capital Accounts
   For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts and distributions to
shareholders are adjusted to reflect the tax character of permanent book/tax
differences. For the period ended December 31, 2003, the Fund increased
accumulated net realized losses on investments, options and futures by $404,
increased Under/(over) distributed net investment income by $410 and decreased
common shares by $6.

                                      20




2. Federal Income Taxes:
   No provision for federal income or excise taxes is required since the Fund
intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute
all of its taxable income and capital gains to its shareholders. Because
federal income tax regulations differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, income and capital gains distributions
determined in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment
income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes.
Accordingly, the character of the distributions and composition of net assets
for tax purposes differ from those reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.

3. Financial Instruments:

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
   As part of the investment program, the Fund may utilize forward currency
exchange contracts. Forward foreign exchange contracts are marked-to-market
daily using forward foreign currency exchange rates supplied by an independent
pricing service. The change in the contract's market value is recorded by the
Fund as an unrealized gain or loss. When a contract is closed or delivery is
taken, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the contact at the time it was opened and the value at the time it
was closed.

   The use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts does not eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's securities, but it does
establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future. These forward
foreign currency exchange contracts involve market risk in excess of amounts
reflected in the financial statements. Although forward foreign currency
exchange contracts used for hedging purposes limit the risk of loss due to the
decline in the value of the hedged currency, they also limit any potential gain
that might result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the
Fund could be exposed to risks if the counterparties to the contracts are
unable to meet the terms of their contracts. The Fund had no outstanding
forward foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2003.

Option and Futures
   As part of the investment program, the Fund may utilize options and futures.
Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the Fund. When a fund purchases a
put or call option, the premium paid is recorded as an investment and its value
is marked-to-market daily. When a fund writes a put or call option, an amount
equal to the premium received by the fund is recorded as a liability and its
value is marked-to-market daily.

 When options, whether written or purchased, expire, are exercised or are
closed (by entering into a closing purchase or sale transaction), the Fund
realizes a gain or loss as described in the chart below:

                                      Fund will realize a loss in this transaction if
                                      the cost of the closing purchase exceeds the
                                      premium received when the option was written.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A written call option is exercised by Realize a gain or loss from the sale of the
the option purchaser                  underlying security. The proceeds of that sale
                                      will be increased by the premium originally
                                      received when the option was written.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A written put option is exercised by  The amount of the premium originally received
the option purchaser                  will reduce the cost of the security that the
                                      Fund purchased when the option was exercised.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

   The risk associated with purchasing options is limited to the premium
originally paid. Options written by a Fund involve, to varying degrees, risk of
loss in excess of the option value reflected in the schedule of investments.
The risk in writing a covered call option is that a Fund may forgo the
opportunity of profit if the market price of the underlying security increases
and the option is exercised. The risk in writing a put option is that the Fund
may incur a loss if the market price of the underlying security decreases and
the option is exercised. In addition, there is a risk a Fund may not be able to
enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market, or,
for over-the-counter options, because of the counterparty's inability or
unwillingness to perform.

   Activity in written call and put options for the year ended December 31,
2003 was as follows:

</TABLE>

   Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit with
the broker cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the
contract amount. This is known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments
("variation margin") are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on
the daily fluctuation in the value of the contract. The daily changes in
contract value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and the Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed. Futures
contracts are valued daily at the settlement price established by the board of
trade or exchange on which they are traded.

   The Fund enters into futures contracts in connection with its interest rate
management strategy, or for other purposes. Futures contracts involve, to
varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the amounts reflected in the
financial statements. The change in the value of the futures contract primarily
corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not
correlate with changes in interest rates (if applicable). In addition, there is
a risk that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market.

   The open short futures positions and related appreciation or depreciation at
December 31, 2003, are listed at the end of the Fund's schedule of investments.

Swap Agreements
   The use of swaps involves risks that are different from those associated
with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Swap agreements may be
considered to be illiquid. Although the Fund will not enter into any swap
agreements unless the adviser

                                      22



believes that the other party to the transaction is creditworthy, the Fund does
bear the risk of loss of the amount expected to be received under a swap
agreement in the event of default or bankruptcy of the agreement counterparty.
The Fund may invest in different types of swap agreements. The Fund had no open
swap agreements at December 31, 2003.

4. Distributions to Shareholders:
   The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 was as follows:

*At December 31, 2003, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of $7,204,
 of which $5,139 expires in the year 2010 and $2,065 expires in the year 2011.
 This amount will be available to offset like amounts of any future taxable
 gains.
**The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized gains/(losses) is
  primarily attributable to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
  difference between book and tax amortization methods of premium and discount
  and the mark to market rules for options and futures contracts and other
  book/tax temporary differences.

   At December 31, 2003, the cost of securities for federal income tax purposes
was $222,950. Accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation of investment was
$17,843 and gross unrealized depreciation of investments was $1,269, resulting
in net unrealized appreciation of $16,574.

5. Common Shares:
   Of the common shares of stock outstanding at December 31, 2003, Western
Asset Management Company owned 8,191 shares (share amounts are not in
thousands).

6. Preferred Shares (amounts are not in thousands):
   There are 2,880 shares of Auction Market Preferred Shares ("Preferred
Shares") authorized. The Preferred Shares have rights as set forth in the
Fund's Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended to date, and its Bylaws,
as amended to date (the "Bylaws"), or as otherwise determined by the Trustees.
The 2,880 Preferred Shares outstanding consist of two series, 1,440 shares of
Series M and 1,440 shares of Series W. The Preferred Shares have a liquidation
value of $25,000 per share, plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends whether
or not earned or declared.

   Dividends on the Series M and Series W Preferred Shares are cumulative and
are paid at a rate typically reset every seven and twenty-eight days,
respectively, based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates ranged from
1.04% to 1.65% from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. Under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund may not declare dividends or make
other distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the
time of the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect
to the outstanding Preferred Shares would be less than 200%.

Annual Report to Shareholders

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
(Amounts in Thousands)


   The Preferred Shares are redeemable at the option of the Fund, in whole or
in part, on the second business day preceding any dividend payment date at
$25,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends. The Preferred
Shares are also subject to mandatory redemption at $25,000 per share plus any
accumulated but unpaid dividends, whether or not earned or declared, if certain
requirements relating to the composition of the assets and liabilities of the
Fund as set forth in the Bylaws are not satisfied.

   Preferred shareholders, who are entitled to one vote per Preferred Share,
generally vote as a single class with the common shareholders, but will vote
separately as a class (and, in certain circumstances, vote separately by
series) with respect to certain matters set forth in the Bylaws. The preferred
shareholders are entitled to elect two Trustees of the Fund.

7. Securities Loaned:
   The Fund may lend its securities to approved brokers to earn additional
income and will receive cash and U.S. government securities as collateral
against the loans. Cash collateral received is invested in a money market
pooled account by the Fund's lending agent. Collateral is maintained over the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


To the Shareholders and Trustees of Western Asset Premier Bond Fund:

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Western Asset Premier Bond
Fund (hereafter referred to as the "Fund") at December 31, 2003, and the
results of its operations, the changes in its net assets, and the financial
highlights for each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
   Western Asset Premier Bond Fund ("WEA") and EquiServe Trust Company N.A.
("Agent"), as the Transfer Agent and Registrar of WEA, offer a convenient way
to add shares of WEA to your account. WEA offers to all common shareholders a
Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"). Under the Plan, cash distributions (e.g.,
dividends and capital gains) on the common shares are automatically invested in
shares of WEA unless the shareholder elects otherwise.

   As a participant in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, you will automatically
receive your dividend or net capital gains distribution in newly issued shares
of WEA, if the market price of the shares on the date of the distribution is at
or above the net asset value ("NAV") of the shares, minus estimated brokerage
commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of common shares on the
open market. The number of shares to be issued to you will be determined by
dividing the amount of the cash distribution to which you are entitled (net of
any applicable withholding taxes) by the greater of the NAV per share on such
date or 95% of the market price of a share on such date. If the market price of
a share on such distribution date is below the NAV, minus estimated brokerage
commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of common shares on the
open market, the Agent will, as agent for the participants, buy shares of WEA
through a broker on the open market. All common shares acquired on your behalf
through the Plan will be automatically credited to an account maintained on the
books of the Agent.

Additional Information Regarding the Plan
   WEA will pay all costs applicable to the Plan, with the exceptions noted
below. Brokerage commissions for open market purchases by the Agent under the
Plan will be charged to participants. All shares acquired through the Plan
receive voting rights and are eligible for any stock split, stock dividend, or
other rights accruing to shareholders that the Board of Trustees may declare.

   You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time by giving written
notice to the Agent. Such termination shall be effective prior to the record
date next succeeding the receipt of such instructions or by a later date of
termination specified in such instructions. Upon termination, a participant may
request a certificate for the full shares credited to his or her account or may
request the sale of all or part of such shares. Fractional shares credited to a
terminating account will be paid for in cash at the current market price at the
time of termination.

   Dividends and other distributions invested in additional shares under the
Plan are subject to income tax just as if they had been received in cash. After
year end, dividends paid on the accumulated shares will be included in the Form
1099-DIV information return to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and only one
Form 1099-DIV will be sent to participants each year.

   Inquiries regarding the Plan, as well as notices of termination, should be
directed to EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43011, Providence, Rhode
Island 02940-3011--Investor Relations telephone number (866) 290-4386.

CODE OF ETHICS CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 FOR
PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

                          November 4, 2003

I.       Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

This  Code  of  Ethics  (this  "Code")   contemplated  by  Section  406  of  the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 has been adopted by Pacific  American Income Shares,
Inc. ("PAIS"),  Western Asset Funds, Inc. ('WAF') and Western Asset Premier Bond
Fund ("WAPBF") (collectively,  the "Funds" and each individually,  a "Fund') and
applies to the Funds' Principal Executive Officers, Principal Financial Officers
and  Principal  Accounting  Officers (the  "Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is
identified in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

o honest and  ethical  conduct,  including  the  ethical  handling  of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;

o full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure in reports and
documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the  Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Fund;

o compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o the prompt  internal  reporting of  violations  of the Code to an  appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and

o accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high  standard of business  ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of interest.

II. Covered  Officers Should Handle  Ethically  Actual or Apparent  Conflicts of
Interest

Overview.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, a Fund. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
the Covered Officer's position with a Fund.

Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between  Covered
Officers  and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest  provisions
in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including the regulations thereunder, the
"1940 Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  (including the regulations
thereunder,  the "Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered Officers may
not engage in certain  transactions  (such as the  purchase or sale of portfolio
securities or other property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated
persons" of such Fund. The  compliance  programs and procedures of each Fund and
its investment  adviser(s)  (each an "Adviser") and other service  providers are
designed  to prevent,  or  identify  and  correct,  violations  of many of those
provisions,  although they are not designed to provide absolute  assurance as to
those  matters.  This Code does not, and is not  intended to,  repeat or replace
these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters
of this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit,
conflicts  may arise  from,  or as a result  of,  the  contractual  relationship
between a Fund and an Adviser,  or a Fund and any other service provider to such
Fund of which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees  (including,
without limitation,  Legg Wood Walker, Incorporated and Legg Mason Fund Adviser,
Inc.). As a result,  this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the
normal course of their duties (whether for a Fund, for an Adviser,  for any such
other service provider or any combination  thereof), be involved in establishing
policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will have  different  effects on an
Adviser or such other  service  provider,  on the one hand,  and a Fund,  on the
other hand.  The  participation  of the Covered  Officers in such  activities is
inherent  in the  contractual  relationships  between  a Fund  and  its  service
providers  and is consistent  with the  performance  by the Covered  Officers of
their duties as officers of the Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity with the
provisions of the 1940 Act, the Investment  Advisers Act,  other  applicable law
and the relevant Fund's constitutional documents, such activities will be deemed
to have been handled  ethically  for purposes of this Code.  In addition,  it is
recognized by the Funds' Boards of  Trustees/Directors  (collectively,  "Boards"
and each individually, a "Board") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment  companies covered by this or other
codes and that such  service,  by itself,  does not give rise to a  conflict  of
interest.

Other  conflicts of interest are covered by the Code,  even if such conflicts of
interest are not the subject of  provisions  of the 1940 Act and the  Investment
Advisers  Act. The  following  list  provides  examples of conflicts of interest
under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are
not  exhaustive.  The overarching  principle is that the personal  interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Fund,
unless  the  personal  interest  has been  disclosed  to and  approved  by other
officers of the Fund or the Fund's Board or a committee of the Fund's Board that
has no such personal interest.



Each Covered Officer must not:

use his or her personal  influence  or personal  relationships  improperly  to
influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting by a Fund whereby the
Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

cause  a Fund to take  action,  or  fail to take  action,  for the  individual
personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of the Fund; or

retaliate  against any other Covered  Officer or any employee of a Fund or its
service  providers  for reports of  potential  violations  that are made in good
faith.

There are some conflict of interest situations that, if material,  should always
be  approved by the Chief Legal  Officer of a Fund.  These  conflict of interest
situations are listed below:

service on the board of  directors  or  governing  board of a publicly  traded
entity;

the receipt of any non-nominal  gifts from persons or entities who have or are
seeking business relationships with a Fund;

the  receipt  of any  entertainment  from any  company  with  which a Fund has
current  or  prospective   business   dealings  unless  such   entertainment  is
business-related,  reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment  relationship with,
any entities doing business with a Fund (other than an Adviser or its affiliates
or, to the extent that such interest or  relationship is disclosed to the Fund's
Board  before such officer is elected,  any other Fund  service  provider or its
affiliates).  This  restriction  shall  not  apply  to or  otherwise  limit  the
ownership  of  publicly  traded  securities  so  long  as the  Covered  Person's
ownership  does not  exceed 2% of the  outstanding  securities  of the  relevant
class.

a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or
spreads paid by a Fund for effecting  portfolio  transactions  or for selling or
redeeming  shares  other than an interest  arising  from the  Covered  Officer's
employment  with an  Adviser or its  affiliates  (or,  to the  extent  that such
employment is disclosed to the Fund's Board before such officer is elected, with
any other Fund service provider or its affiliates).  This restriction  shall not
apply to or otherwise limit the ownership of publicly traded  securities so long
as the  Covered  Person's  ownership  does  not  exceed  2% of  the  outstanding
securities of the relevant class.

III.     Disclosure and Compliance

Each Covered  Officer  should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to
misrepresent,  facts about a Fund to others, whether within or outside the Fund,
including to the Fund's Board and auditors,  and to governmental  regulators and
self-regulatory organizations;

Each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate within his or her area
of  responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees of a Fund and its
Adviser(s) and, as applicable,  other Fund service  providers or with counsel to
the  Fund  with  the  goal  of  promoting  full,  fair,  accurate,   timely  and
understandable  disclosure  in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or
submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications made by the Fund (which,
for  sake  of  clarity,   does  not  include  any  sales  literature,   omitting
prospectuses,   or  "tombstone"  advertising  prepared  by  a  Fund's  principal
underwriter(s)); and

It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote  compliance with
the  standards  and   restrictions   imposed  by  applicable   laws,  rules  and
regulations.

IV.      Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

upon  adoption  of the Code (or  thereafter  as  applicable,  upon  becoming a
Covered  Officer),  affirm in writing to the Funds that he or she has  received,
read and understands the Code;

provide full and fair  responses to all questions  asked in a Fund's  periodic
Director/Trustee  and  Officer  Questionnaire  as well as  with  respect  to any
supplemental request for information; and

notify the Chief  Legal  Officer of a Fund  promptly if he or she knows of any
material violation of this Code.

The Chief  Legal  Officer of a Fund is  responsible  for  applying  this Code to
specific  situations  in  which  questions  are  presented  under it and has the
authority to  interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  However,  any
approvals  or  waivers  sought by the Chief  Legal  Officer,  other  than  those
expressly contemplated herein, will be considered by a Fund's audit committee.

Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code:

the Chief Legal Officer will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
potential material violations reported to him, which actions may include the use
of internal or external counsel, accountants or other personnel;

if,  after  such  investigation,  the Chief  Legal  Officer  believes  that no
material violation has occurred, the Chief Legal Officer is not required to take
any further action;

any matter that the Chief Legal Officer believes is a material  violation will
be reported to the Fund's audit committee;

if the audit committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it will
inform and make a  recommendation  to the  Fund's  Board,  which  will  consider
appropriate action,  which may include review of, and appropriate  modifications
to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of
an  Adviser  or  other   applicable   service   provider  or  its  board;  or  a
recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

the Fund's audit  committee will be authorized to grant  waivers,  as it deems
appropriate;

any  changes  to or waivers of this Code  will,  to the  extent  required,  be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. Other Policies and Procedures

This Code shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted by the Funds for purposes of
Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the rules and forms  applicable  to
registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar  as  other  policies  or
procedures of a Fund or its Adviser(s) or other Fund service providers govern or
purport to govern the  behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are
subject to this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict  with the  provisions  of this  Code.  A Fund's and its  Advisers'  and
service  providers'  codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Advisers' and other service  providers'  more detailed  compliance  policies and
procedures  are  separate  requirements  applying  to the Covered  Officers  and
others, and are not part of this Code.

VI. Amendments

Any  amendments  to this  Code,  other  than  amendments  to  Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of a Fund's Board.

VII. Confidentiality

All  reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code will be
considered  confidential  and shall be  maintained  and  protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed  to anyone other than to each Fund's Board or the board or counsel for
any other registered  investment  company for which a Covered Person serves in a
similar capacity or as otherwise authorized by a Fund's Board.

VIII. Internal Use

The Code is  intended  solely  for the  internal  use by the  Funds and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Funds,  as to  any  fact,
circumstance or legal conclusion.

Procedure: Proxy Voting

Departments Impacted:  Investment  Management,  Compliance,  Investment Support,
Client Services

References:  Western Asset Compliance  Manual Section R Proxy Voting Investment
Advisers  Act Rule  206(4)-6  and Rule  204-2  ERISA DOL  Bulletin  94-2  C.F.R.
2509.94-2

Effective: August 1, 2003


                                   Background

Western Asset Management  Company  ("Western Asset") has adopted and implemented
policies and procedures  that we believe are reasonably  designed to ensure that
proxies  are voted in the best  interest  of  clients,  in  accordance  with our
fiduciary duties and SEC Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
("Advisers  Act").  Our  authority  to  vote  the  proxies  of  our  clients  is
established through investment  management  agreements or comparable  documents,
and our proxy voting  guidelines  have been tailored to reflect  these  specific
contractual obligations. In addition to SEC requirements governing advisers, our
proxy  voting  policies  reflect  the  long-standing   fiduciary  standards  and
responsibilities  for ERISA accounts.  Unless a manager of ERISA assets has been
expressly precluded from voting proxies,  the Department of Labor has determined
that the responsibility for these votes lies with the Investment Manager.

In exercising its voting authority, Western Asset will not consult or enter into
agreements  with  officers,  directors or employees of Legg Mason Inc. or any of
its affiliates (other than Western Asset Management  Company Limited)  regarding
the voting of any securities owned by its clients.

                                     Policy

Western  Asset's proxy voting  procedures are designed and  implemented in a way
that is reasonably expected to ensure that proxy matters are handled in the best
interest of our clients.  While the  guidelines  included in the  procedures are
intended to provide a benchmark  for voting  standards,  each vote is ultimately
cast  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into  consideration  Western  Asset's
contractual  obligations  to our  clients  and  all  other  relevant  facts  and
circumstances  at the  time of the  vote  (such  that  these  guidelines  may be
overridden to the extent Western Asset deems appropriate).



                                   Procedures

Responsibility and Oversight

The Western Asset Compliance Department ("Compliance Department") is responsible
for  administering  and  overseeing the proxy voting  process.  The gathering of
proxies is coordinated  through the Corporate Actions area of Investment Support
("Corporate Actions").  Research analysts and portfolio managers are responsible
for  determining  appropriate  voting  positions  on each  proxy  utilizing  any
applicable guidelines contained in these procedures.

Client Authority

Prior to August 1, 2003, all existing client  investment  management  agreements
(IMAs)  will be reviewed to determine  whether  Western Asset has authority to
vote client  proxies.  At account  start-up,  or upon  amendment  of an IMA, the
applicable client IMA are similarly reviewed. If an agreement is silent on proxy
voting, but contains an overall delegation of discretionary  authority or if the
account   represents  assets  of  an  ERISA  plan,  Western  Asset  will  assume
responsibility  for proxy voting. The Client Account Transition Team maintains a
matrix of proxy voting authority.

Registered  owners of  record,  client  custodians,  client  banks and  trustees
(Proxy  Recipients)  that receive proxy  materials on behalf of clients should
forward them to Corporate Actions.  Prior to August 1, 2003, Proxy Recipients of
existing  clients  will be  reminded  of the  appropriate  routing to  Corporate
Actions for proxy  materials  received and reminded of their  responsibility  to
forward all proxy materials on a timely basis.  Proxy Recipients for new clients
(or, if Western Asset becomes aware that the applicable  Proxy  Recipient for an
existing client has changed,  the Proxy  Recipient for the existing  client) are
notified  at  start-up  of  appropriate  routing to  Corporate  Actions of proxy
materials  received  and reminded of their  responsibility  to forward all proxy
materials on a timely basis.  If Western Asset  personnel  other than  Corporate
Actions receive proxy  materials,  they should promptly forward the materials to
Corporate Actions.

Proxy Voting

Once proxy  materials are received by Corporate  Actions,  they are forwarded to
the Compliance Department for coordination and the following actions:

a. Proxies are reviewed to determine accounts impacted.

b. Impacted accounts are checked to confirm Western Asset voting authority.

c.  Compliance  Department  staff reviews proxy issues to determine any material
conflicts of interest.  (See conflicts of interest  section of these  procedures
for further information on determining material conflicts of interest.)

d. If a material  conflict  of  interest  exists,  (i) to the extent  reasonably
practicable  and permitted by applicable  law, the client is promptly  notified,
the conflict is disclosed and Western  Asset  obtains the client's  proxy voting
instructions,  and (ii) to the extent that it is not  reasonably  practicable or
permitted by  applicable  law to notify the client and obtain such  instructions
(e.g.,  the client is a mutual fund or other  commingled  vehicle or is an ERISA
plan client),  Western Asset seeks voting instructions from an independent third
party.

e.  Compliance  Department  staff  provides  proxy  material to the  appropriate
research analyst or portfolio manager to obtain their recommended vote. Research
analysts and portfolio  managers  determine votes on a case-by-case basis taking
into account the voting guidelines contained in these procedures.  For avoidance
of doubt,  depending on the best  interest of each  individual  client,  Western
Asset may vote the same proxy differently for different  clients.  The analyst's
or portfolio  manager's basis for their decision is documented and maintained by
the Compliance Department.

f.  Compliance  Department  staff votes the proxy  pursuant to the  instructions
received in (d) or (e) and returns  the voted  proxy as  indicated  in the proxy
materials.

Timing

Western  Asset  personnel  act in such a manner to ensure that,  absent  special
circumstances,  the proxy  gathering  and proxy  voting steps noted above can be
completed before the applicable deadline for returning proxy votes.

Recordkeeping

Western Asset  maintains  records of proxies voted  pursuant to Section 204-2 of
the Advisers Act and ERISA DOL Bulletin 94-2. These records include:

a. A copy of Western Asset's policies and procedures.

b. Copies of proxy statements received regarding client securities.

c. A copy of any document created by Western Asset that was material to making a
decision how to vote proxies.

d. Each  written  client  request for proxy voting  records and Western  Asset's
written response to both verbal and written client requests.

e. A proxy log  including:  1. Issuer name;  2.  Exchange  ticker  symbol of the
issuer's  shares to be voted;  3. Council on Uniform  Securities  Identification
Procedures   ("CUSIP")   number  for  the  shares  to  be  voted;   4.  A  brief
identification of the matter voted on; 5. Whether the matter was proposed by the
issuer or by a  shareholder  of the  issuer;  6.  Whether a vote was cast on the
matter;  7. A record of how the vote was cast;  and 8. Whether the vote was cast
for or against the recommendation of the issuer's management team.

Records are maintained in an easily  accessible  place for five years, the first
two in Western Asset's offices.

Disclosure

Western  Asset's proxy policies are described in the firm's Part II of Form ADV.
Prior to August 1, 2003,  Western Asset will deliver Part II of its revised Form
ADV to all existing clients, along with a letter identifying the new disclosure.
Clients will be provided a copy of these policies and  procedures  upon request.
In addition, upon request, clients may receive reports on how their proxies have
been voted.

Conflicts of Interest

All proxies are reviewed by the Compliance  Department for material conflicts of
interest. Issues to be reviewed include, but are not limited to:

1. Whether  Western (or, to the extent  required to be  considered by applicable
law, its affiliates)  manages assets for the company or an employee group of the
company or otherwise has an interest in the company;

2.  Whether  Western  or an  officer or  director  of Western or the  applicable
portfolio  manager  or  analyst  responsible  for  recommending  the proxy  vote
(together,  "Voting  Persons")  is a  close  relative  of or has a  personal  or
business  relationship with an executive,  director or person who is a candidate
for director of the company or is a participant in a proxy contest; and

3. Whether there is any other business or personal  relationship  where a Voting
Person has a personal interest in the outcome of the matter before shareholders.

                                   Voting Guidelines

Western Asset's  substantive  voting  decisions turn on the particular facts and
circumstances  of each proxy vote and are evaluated by the  designated  research
analyst  or  portfolio  manager.  The  examples  outlined  below  are  meant  as
guidelines to aid in the decision making process.

Guidelines are grouped according to the types of proposals  generally  presented
to  shareholders.  Part I deals with proposals  which have been approved and are
recommended  by a company's  board of  directors;  Part II deals with  proposals
submitted by shareholders for inclusion in proxy statements;  Part III addresses
issues relating to voting shares of investment companies;  and Part IV addresses
unique considerations pertaining to foreign issuers.

I. Board Approved Proposals

The vast  majority  of matters  presented  to  shareholders  for a vote  involve
proposals  made by a company  itself that have been approved and  recommended by
its board of directors.  In view of the enhanced corporate  governance practices
currently being implemented in public  companies,  Western Asset generally votes
in support  of  decisions  reached  by  independent  boards of  directors.  More
specific guidelines related to certain board-approved proposals are as follows:

1. Matters relating to the Board of Directors

Western  Asset votes  proxies for the  election of the  company's  nominees  for
directors  and for  board-approved  proposals on other  matters  relating to the
board of directors with the following exceptions:

a. Votes are  withheld  for the entire  board of directors if the board does not
have a majority of independent  directors or the board does not have nominating,
audit and compensation committees composed solely of independent directors.

b.  Votes are  withheld  for any  nominee  for  director  who is  considered  an
independent  director by the company and who has received  compensation from the
company other than for service as a director.

c. Votes are  withheld for any nominee for director who attends less than 75% of
board and committee meetings without valid reasons for absences.

d. Votes are cast on a case-by-case basis in contested elections of directors.


2. Matters relating to Executive Compensation

Western Asset  generally  favors  compensation  programs  that relate  executive
compensation  to  a  company's  long-term  performance.  Votes  are  cast  on  a
case-by-case   basis  on   board-approved   proposals   relating  to   executive
compensation, except as follows:

a. Except where the firm is otherwise  withholding votes for the entire board of
directors,  Western  Asset  votes for stock  option  plans that will result in a
minimal annual dilution.  . b. Western Asset votes against stock option plans or
proposals that permit replacing or repricing of underwater options.

c.  Western  Asset votes  against  stock  option  plans that permit  issuance of
options with an exercise price below the stock's current market price.

d. Except where the firm is otherwise  withholding votes for the entire board of
directors,  Western Asset votes for employee stock purchase plans that limit the
discount for shares purchased under the plan to no more than 15% of their market
value,  have an  offering  period of 27 months or less and result in dilution of
10% or less.

3. Matters relating to Capitalization

The management of a company's capital  structure  involves a number of important
issues,  including cash flows,  financing  needs and market  conditions that are
unique to the circumstances of each company. As a result, Western Asset votes on
a  case-by-case  basis  on  board-approved  proposals  involving  changes  to  a
company's  capitalization  except where Western  Asset is otherwise  withholding
votes for the entire board of directors.

a. Western Asset votes for proposals relating to the authorization of additional
common stock.

b. Western Asset votes for proposals to effect stock splits  (excluding  reverse
stock splits).

c. Western Asset votes for proposals authorizing share repurchase programs.

4.  Matters  relating  to  Acquisitions,   Mergers,  Reorganizations  and  Other
Transactions

Western  Asset  votes these  issues on a  case-by-case  basis on  board-approved
transactions.

5. Matters relating to Anti-Takeover Measures

Western  Asset votes  against  board-approved  proposals to adopt  anti-takeover
measures except as follows:

a. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify or approve
shareholder rights plans.

b. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on proposals to adopt fair price
provisions.

6. Other Business Matters

Western Asset votes for board-approved proposals approving such routine business
matters  such as changing the  company's  name,  ratifying  the  appointment  of
auditors and procedural matters relating to the shareholder meeting.

a. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to amend a company's
charter or bylaws.

b. Western Asset votes against  authorization  to transact  other  unidentified,
substantive business at the meeting.

II. Shareholder Proposals

SEC  regulations  permit  shareholders  to submit  proposals  for inclusion in a
company's proxy statement.  These proposals generally seek to change some aspect
of a company's  corporate  governance  structure or to change some aspect of its
business  operations.  Western Asset votes in accordance with the recommendation
of the  company's  board of directors on all  shareholder  proposals,  except as
follows:

1. Western Asset votes for shareholder proposals to require shareholder approval
of shareholder rights plans.

2.  Western  Asset votes for  shareholder  proposals  that are  consistent  with
Western Asset's proxy voting guidelines for board-approved proposals.

3. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on other  shareholder  proposals
where the firm is otherwise withholding votes for the entire board of directors.

III. Voting Shares of Investment Companies

Western Asset may utilize shares of open or closed-end  investment  companies to
implement its investment strategies.  Shareholder votes for investment companies
that  fall  within  the  categories  listed in Parts I and II above are voted in
accordance with those guidelines.

1. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on proposals relating to changes
in the  investment  objectives of an investment  company taking into account the
original  intent  of the  fund and the  role  the  fund  plays  in the  clients'
portfolios.

2. Western Asset votes on a  case-by-case  basis all proposals that would result
in increases in expenses (e.g., proposals to adopt 12b-1 plans, alter investment
advisory  arrangements or approve fund mergers)  taking into account  comparable
expenses for similar funds and the services to be provided.

IV. Voting Shares of Foreign Issuers

In the event  Western  Asset is required to vote on  securities  held in foreign
issuers  - i.e.  issuers  that are  incorporated  under  the  laws of a  foreign
jurisdiction and that are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange or the NASDAQ
stock  market,  the  following  guidelines  are used,  which are premised on the
existence  of a sound  corporate  governance  and  disclosure  framework.  These
guidelines, however, may not be appropriate under some circumstances for foreign
issuers and therefore apply only where applicable.

1. Western Asset votes for shareholder  proposals  calling for a majority of the
directors to be independent of management.

2.  Western  Asset  votes for  shareholder  proposals  seeking to  increase  the
independence of board nominating, audit and compensation committees.

3.  Western  Asset votes for  shareholder  proposals  that  implement  corporate
governance standards similar to those established under U.S. federal law and the
listing requirements of U.S. stock exchanges,  and that do not otherwise violate
the laws of the jurisdiction under which the company is incorporated.

4. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on proposals relating to (1) the
issuance  of common  stock in excess of 20% of a  company's  outstanding  common
stock where  shareholders do not have preemptive  rights, or (2) the issuance of
common  stock in excess of 100% of a company's  outstanding  common  stock where
shareholders have preemptive rights.
