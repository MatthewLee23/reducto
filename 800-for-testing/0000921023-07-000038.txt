Dear Shareowner,
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Staying diversified and keeping your portfolio invested in the markets are two
general investment principles that have served investors well over time. Those
were particularly useful guides during the past year, as U.S. and global stock
and bond markets grew strongly during the period.

In the 12 months ending May 31, 2007, global stock markets were supported by
relatively low short-term interest rates and generally strong economies. The
U.S. stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, gained
approximately 23% over the 12 month period. International developed and
emerging markets equities performed even better, with MSCI's indexes of those
regions rising approximately 27% and 39%, respectively. The general U.S. bond
market, as measured by the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, returned
roughly 7%. The high yield market, as measured by the Merrill Lynch High Yield
Bond Master II Index, returned approximately 13% during the same period.

While still strong, the rate of U.S. economic growth has slowed over the past
year. That was due in large part to a slowdown in new home construction and in
part to the lagging effects of rising energy and commodity prices as well as
rising short-term interest rates. But slowing economic activity is also due in
part to the natural maturation of the cyclical expansion as U.S. factories
approach full utilization and the labor markets approach full employment.

We have enjoyed a cyclical recovery with strong economic growth, and while U.S.
economic growth has slowed, we believe that continuing growth at a slower rate
appears more likely than a recession. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated a
reduced likelihood of future rate hikes, but continues to highlight its
commitment to keeping inflationary pressures contained. This is in keeping with
"best practices" among the world's central banks: low and stable inflation is
believed to be the best backdrop for stable economic growth and low average
unemployment.

In Europe, healthy labor markets are supporting growing consumption and solid
GDP growth, helped by productivity gains and a positive operating environment
for European companies that are finding strong export markets for their goods
and services around the globe. European inflationary pressures appear to be
largely under control, with

the European Central bank remaining strongly vigilant. Japanese economic growth
continues to make progress, and the country has become a more attractive market
as deflationary problems recede. Economic growth in emerging market countries
remains faster than in the developed world as they continue to "catch up."
Leading the way is China, which continues its rise as a world economic power.

Looking forward, we believe that the overall climate for investors generally
will continue to be positive, although valuations are less attractive than they
were a year ago and a correction after a period of strong performance is
possible. Sudden swings in the markets are always to be expected. Just as
staying diversified and invested are important investment principles, it is
also important to pay attention to asset allocation. As always, we encourage
shareholders to work closely with their financial advisor to find the mix of
stocks, bonds and money market assets that is aligned to their particular risk
tolerance and investment objective.

Respectfully,


/s/Daniel K. Kingsbury

   Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
   month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher
   than the performance data quoted.

   Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
   guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will
   fluctuate, and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to
   such factors as interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of
   borrowers.

   Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or
   commissions. All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

   Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
   There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end
   funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
   trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV is total assets less total
   liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of
   common shares outstanding.

   When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested
   at the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher,
   dividends are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's
   dividend reinvestment plan.

   The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and
   taxes that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption
   of Trust shares.

   Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is a
   representative index of tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated
   leveraged loans. The index began in January 1992. Index returns are
   calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust
   returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. You cannot
   invest directly in an Index.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 5/31/07
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This semiannual report for Pioneer Floating Rate Trust covers the six-month
period from December 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007. In the report, portfolio
managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of Highland Capital Management, the
Trust's subadviser, discuss the Trust's investment process, strategy and
outlook.

Q:  How did the Trust perform over the six months?

A:  For the six-month period ended May 31, 2007, Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
    returned 6.54% at net asset value, including reinvestment of dividends.
    The market price return over that same period was 12.98%, and the Trust
    was selling at a premium of market price to net asset value of 2.21%,
    compared to a discount of market price to net asset value of 5.14% a year
    ago on May 31, 2006. The Trust's benchmark, the Credit Suisse Leveraged
    Loan Index, returned 4.07% for the same period. Unlike open-ended funds, a
    closed-end fund's price goes up and down based on market supply and
    demand, independent of the fund's net asset value per share.

    During the six months, the Federal funds target rate remained unchanged at
    5.25%, and the yield on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR)
    was stable at 5.36%. LIBOR is the rate of interest at which banks borrow
    funds from other banks.

    Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
    month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher
    than the performance data quoted.

    The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no
    guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will
    fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their
    original cost.

Q:  What was the investment environment like over the six-month period ended May
    31, 2007?

A:  The investment environment was favorable for floating-rate securities, with
    new issue bank loan volume reaching new highs. Bank loan volume totaled
    $305 billion through the first five months of 2007, up from $209 billion -
    or 46% -- during the comparable time period in 2006, according to Standard
    and Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data (S&PLCD). Default rates were low,
    and April

    marked the fifth consecutive month without a single default. The April
    lagging 12-month default rate hit a new all-time low of 0.44% of
    outstanding loans, down from 1.53% a year ago, as tracked by S&PLCD. On
    May 31, 2007, the spread (difference in the average yield) of the Credit
    Suisse Leveraged Loan Index and the average yield of LIBOR was 244 basis
    points. (One basis point equals 0.01%.) However, the weighted average
    coupon - or stated rate of interest - during the first half of the fiscal
    period was strong, with the spread on the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan
    Index ranging from 7.79% to 7.92% over LIBOR.

Q:  What were the principal investment strategies used in managing the Trust?

A:  Our strategies were driven by our belief that the economy was healthy and
    that the leveraged loan markets would perform well in 2007. We continued
    to keep the portfolio fully invested by using available cash to add newly
    issued loans that we felt would trade higher in the secondary markets. As
    of May 31, 2007 the Trust was well diversified with positions in 194
    issuers across 25 industries. As a percentage of total investment
    portfolio, approximately 88.3% was in loans, 1.3% in equities, 3.7% was in
    bonds and 6.7% in temporary cash investments. Approximately 7.10% of the
    Trust was in second lien loans. The largest sector positions in the
    portfolio were media and telecommunications, healthcare and information
    technology. Some of our core positions included HCA, a corporate operator
    of hospitals, and media concerns The Tribune Co., Univision Communications
    and Seven Media Group.

    On May 31, 2007, 29.7% of the Trust was leveraged, which means that we
    borrowed funds at low rates and invested those funds in high-yielding
    securities. This leveraging strategy has aided returns. Over the first
    half of the fiscal year, short-term rates showed little volatility.
    However, should rates decline, the cost of borrowing would also go down,
    providing the Trust with a modest amount of additional income. A rise in
    short-term interest rates in the future would add to the Trust's borrowing
    costs, and the ability to sustain present distribution levels could be
    affected.

Q:  The monthly income distribution to shareholders was steady at $0.145 per
    share each month. What accounted for this consistent income stream?

A:  During 2006 the monthly distribution was raised three times, but this year
    we have kept the amount relatively stable at approximately $0.145
    primarily because of the relatively stable short-term interest-rate
    environment.

Q:  What is your outlook?

A:  The surge of merger and acquisition activity, fueled by a shift in ownership
    from public to private markets, should continue to enhance our market's
    record new issuance. This should provide a strong backdrop for us - one in
    which we will be able to be very selective in purchasing securities for
    the Trust. While we do not anticipate a material increase in default
    rates, we believe that the current level of 0.44% is statistically
    unsustainable. Even a modest rise in defaults should provide some
    higher-yielding investment opportunities for the Trust, because the
    increase in perceived risk would be rewarded with higher yields.

    Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained
    in the Trust's original offering prospectus. Please refer to this document
    when considering the Trust's risks.

    Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
    greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
    that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

    When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the
    Trust will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices
    of fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The floating
    rate feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not experience capital
    appreciation in a declining interest-rate environment. Investments in the
    Trust are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers
    of underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt
    obligations.


                                                                               9

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 5/31/07                            (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
    and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.


    The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
    invested in floating rate senior loans and securities deemed to be
    illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair
    price at the times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and
    their market price is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
    securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value, and
    investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the
    Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.


    The Trust may use leverage through the issuance of preferred shares with
    an aggregate liquidation preference of up to 331/3% of the Trust's total
    assets after such issuance. Leverage creates significant risks, including
    the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be
    sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
    return for the holders of common shares.


    The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher
    percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund. Being
    non-diversified may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events
    affecting a particular issuer.


    Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic
    trends or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future
    performance are statements of the opinion of the Trust's sub-advisors as
    of the date of this report. These statements should not be relied upon for
    any other purposes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results,
    and there is no guarantee that market forecasts discussed will be
    realized.

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The investment objective
of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary goal of high current income.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The
Trust may invest in Senior Loans and other securities of any credit quality,
including Senior Loans and other investments that are rated below investment
grade, or are unrated but are determined by the investment subadviser to be of
equivalent credit quality. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Trust
believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more
difficult to value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.


                                                                              33

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/07 (unaudited)                  (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus, with additional information included in the
Trust's shareowner reports. Please refer to those documents when considering
the Trust's risks. At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries
or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more
susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other
risks affecting those industries and sectors.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:


A.  Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior Loans are
    valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of Trustees
    at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or
    more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the
    limited number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes are
    available, such Senior Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
    through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations.

    Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent
    pricing services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
    maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by values obtained
    from dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued
    at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded.
    Securities or loans for which quotations are not readily available are
    valued at their fair values as determined by, or under the direction of,
    the Board of Trustees. Trading in foreign securities is substantially
    completed


34
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of
    such securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's
    shares are determined as of such times. The Trust may also use the fair
    value of a security, including a non-U.S. security, when the closing
    market price on the primary exchange where the security is traded no
    longer accurately reflects the value of the security as of the close of
    the exchange. At May 31, 2007, the Trust held no fair valued securities.
    Temporary cash investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates
    market value.

    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
    dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
    passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
    data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Discount and premium on debt
    securities are accreted or amortized, respectively, daily, on an effective
    yield to maturity basis and are included in interest income. Interest
    income, including income on interest bearing cash accounts, is recorded on
    an accrual basis.

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.  Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
    among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
    contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between
    the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in market price of those securities but are included
    with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.


                                                                              35

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


C. Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
    distribute all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if
    any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
    required.

    The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
    financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
    income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may
    be shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in
    excess of net investment income or net realized gain on investment
    transactions, or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax
    differences that may exist.

    The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and
    preferred shareowners will be determined at the end of the current fiscal
    year. Distributions during the year ended November 30, 2006 were as
    follows:

   Total                          $17,269,669
                                  ===========
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>


    The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation is
    primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
    methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities.

D.  Repurchase Agreements

    With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
    of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
    received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
    excess of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase. The collateral
    for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
    account of the Trust's custodian, or subcustodians. Pioneer Investment
    Management, Inc., the Trust's investment adviser is responsible for
    determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the
    repurchase price.


E.  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

    All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
    Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
    dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
    full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash.
    Shareowners may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not
    participating in the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain
    distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary
    and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by notifying
    American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in
    administering the Plan (the "Plan Agent"), in writing prior to any
    dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
    effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
    distribution.

    Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
    participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
    acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional
    unissued but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase
    of outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
    If, on the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common
    share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
    brokerage trading fees ("market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the
    dividend amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued
    common shares to be credited to each account will be determined by
    dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per
    common share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum
    discount from the then current


                                                                              37

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/07 (unaudited)                  (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    market price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on
    the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
    greater than the market value ("market discount"), the Plan Agent will
    invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market
    purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued
    common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
    brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
    open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
    shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
    dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
    brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to another broker
    and continue to participate in the Plan.


2. Management Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM"), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary
of UniCredito Italiano S.p.A. ("UniCredito Italiano") manages the Trust's
portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory Agreement with
PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily value of the
Trust's total assets minus the sum of the Trust's liabilities, which
liabilities exclude debt related to leverage, short-term debt and the aggregate
liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred shares. For the six months
ended May 31, 2007, the net management fee was equivalent to 0.70 % of the
Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.04% of the
Trust's average daily net assets attributable to the common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. For the
six months ended May 31, 2007, $471,828 was payable to PIM related to
management costs, administrative costs and certain other services and is
included in "Due to affiliate" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

PIM has appointed Princeton Administrators, LLC ("Princeton") to provide
certain administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. PIM
pays Princeton a monthly fee equal to 0.07% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in
excess of $500 million. Princeton receives no compensation directly from the
Trust.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PIM has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments. PIM
pays the Sub-adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.35% of the average
daily value of the Trust managed assets. The fee is paid monthly in arrears.
The Trust does not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

Also, PIM has agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations to limit the Trust's total annual expenses excluding offering costs
for common and preferred shares, interest expense, the cost of defending or
prosecuting any claim or litigation to which the Trust is a party (together
with any amount in judgment or settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes
incurred due to the failure of the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company under the Code or any other non-recurring or non-operating expenses; to
0.95% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. The dividend on any
preferred shares is not an expense for this purpose. For the six months ended
May 31, 2007, the Trust's expenses were not reduced under such arrangements.

3. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver
currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust
must make delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the
settlement date of a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by
entering into an offsetting hedge contract. At May 31, 2007, the Trust had no
outstanding portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

4. Unfunded Loan Commitments

As of May 31, 2007, the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of approximately
$10,494,000 which could be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to
the following loan agreements:

                                                                              39

owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredito Italiano, through a sub-transfer agency
agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially
all transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares
at negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank") is
the transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and redemption agent with

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As
of May 31, 2007, there were 9,380 AMPS as follows: Series M7-3,130, Series
W7-3,125 and Series TH7-3,125.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates
ranged from 4.95% to 5.35% during the six months ended May 31, 2007.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding
preferred shares would be less than 200%.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Agreement and
Declaration of Trust are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required
to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the
preferred shares and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders,
including, among other things, changes in the Trust's

7. New Pronouncements

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing the Trust's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions have a "more-likely-than-not" probability of being sustained by the
applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to not meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in
the reporting period in which they are realized. Adoption of FIN 48 is required
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all
open tax years as of no later than November 30, 2007. At this time, management
is evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and any impact in the financial
statements has not been determined.

In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
157 Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157") was issued and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. At this time, management is currently evaluating the
implications of SFAS 157 and its impact on the Trust's financial statement
disclosures, if any, has not yet been determined.


8. Subsequent Event

Subsequent to May 31, 2007, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.145 per common share
payable June 29, 2007, to common shareowners of record on June 15, 2007.

Subsequent to May 31, 2007, dividends declared and paid on preferred stock
totaled $929,369 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share series
through July 6, 2007.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive officer or

similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer

performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.
