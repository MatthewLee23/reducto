TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

We are happy to present to you our report for the year ended October 31, 2005,
which we believe contains complete and pertinent financial information.

During the past fiscal year, BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") has had strong
performance, which reinforces the Board's long-term strategy to remain well
diversified across asset categories. For the latest fiscal year, earnings
including unrealized gains were $16,606,626.

Over the past year, cheap foreign money and accommodative fiscal and monetary
policy continued to place America as the engine of growth for the world economy.
Americans, aided by borrowed funds from foreigners, continued to drive the world
economy by pouring money into consumption and the housing market. This
environment coupled with remarkable productivity growth resulted in good
corporate earnings growth and healthy stock markets. During this period,
interest rates rose, dampening returns in the bond market. For the year ended
September 30, 2005, the Fund's combined portfolio provided a total return of
16.48%, compared to 12.25% for the S&P 500 and 2.81% for the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Index.

Despite rising energy prices and higher short-term interest rates over the
summer, stocks in the third quarter advanced in the wake of favorable economic
news and relatively strong corporate earnings. Bonds did not do as well in light
of the difficult interest rate environment. For the three-month period ended
September 30, 2005 the combined Fund portfolio provided a positive return of
6.18%. This compared to 3.60% for the S&P 500 and .65% for the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Index.

The BMC Fund managers outperformed the equity benchmarks for both the above
periods largely by overweighting the portfolio in investments related to REITS,
energy, utilities and emerging markets. Over the past few months, we have sold
the REIT portfolio and continue to trim our positions in energy and utilities.

Bond investment returns lagged the benchmark since much of the returns in Lehman
Brothers Aggregate Index came from the long end of the market as well as lower
quality issues which we are not comfortable owning. Last year the Fund's
managers shortened the portfolios duration expecting the bonds with longer
maturities to suffer as short-term rates rose. Long-term rates did drift higher
but not as much as expected and long-term bonds outperformed short-term bonds.
Apparently the market believes that the current trend in labor costs will keep
inflation in check. In short, investors recognize that about 70 percent of all
costs are labor costs and that those costs are rising at only 2 percent year. So
even with higher energy prices, investors currently believe that inflation
should not be problematic.

The housing market has already shown signs of weakening and will likely have a
negative impact on consumer spending. The good news is that inflation will
probably remain low for the time being as the economy slows. Even so, growth in
this country will probably outpace Europe's. Currently, equity valuations are
reasonable relative to earnings and interest rate levels. However, a slower
economy will mean lower earnings, which will place a ceiling on stock prices.


                                       2

It is important to note that although the benchmark comparisons shown above are
helpful, they do not take into account the diversified nature of the Fund. The
long-term goal is not to beat the market but to produce an income for
shareholders of 4.5 percent, while at the same time growing the asset base to
maintain "real value," or after inflation value of the Fund. To accomplish this,
the Fund is well diversified among stocks, bonds and real estate.

Low yields make the bond market unattractive. As a result, the Fund's managers
have allowed the equity allocation to grow by approximately 11 percent by not
rebalancing into bonds. At our fiscal year end, the Fund was invested 63.61% in
equities and 6.70% in bonds, compared to 52.75% and 9.59% last year,
respectively.

In light of expectations for slowing growth, we are now looking to reduce some
of the equity exposure and are evaluating other non US bond investment to
provide the Fund with further diversification benefits.

New equity investments will be, as in the past, a reflection of the investment
teams focus on research and seeking out opportunities on a company-by-company
basis. Currently, the best values can be found among transnational companies
that are less economically sensitive and that should benefit from the high
growth Asian economies.

During the year ended October 31, 2005, the Fund paid the following dividends
per share:

      December 10, 2004 to shareholders of record November 25, 2004   $ .71
      March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record February 25, 2005        .25
      June 10, 2005 to shareholders of record May 25, 2005              .25
      September 10, 2005 to shareholders of record August 25, 2005      .25
                                                                      -----

      Total                                                           $1.46
                                                                      =====

The Fund paid a dividend of $2.03 per share on December 10, 2005 to shareholders
of record November 25, 2005.

Schedule I is a listing of the entire Fund's diversified securities at October
31, 2005, with a total market value of $137,765,296.

audits. The financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended
March 31, 2000 were audited by other auditors whose report dated May 19, 2000
expressed an unqualified opinion on the financial highlights for those five
years.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and the financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of BMC Fund, Inc. as of October
31, 2005, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in
its net assets for the years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, and the financial
highlights for the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the seven months
ended October 31, 2002 and the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

BMC FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year Ended October 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company") is a closed-end, diversified investment
      company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
      Prior to becoming a regulated investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
      Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary
      of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the
      preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity
      with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies.

      A.    Investment Valuations - The investment securities are stated at
            market value as determined by closing prices on national securities
            exchanges. Investment securities include corporate bonds, mutual
            funds, and common and preferred stocks.

            The investments in limited partnerships, other investments and
            venture capital are stated at estimated fair value as determined by
            the management of these investments and are approved by the
            Company's Valuation Committee after giving consideration to
            historical and projected financial results, economic conditions,
            financial condition of investee and other factors and events subject
            to change. Because of the inherent uncertainty of those valuations,
            the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that
            would have been used had a ready market value for the investments
            existed, and these differences could be material.

            The carrying value of the investments in wholly owned subsidiaries
            is based on an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the
            subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of the wholly owned subsidiaries in
            the statement of operations represents the current year earnings of
            the subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method.

            The carrying value of the investment in real estate is based on an
            independent appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate.

      B.    Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for
            on the date the order to buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
            losses on investments are determined on the basis of specific
            identification of issues sold or matured. The aggregate dollar
            amount of purchases and sales of investment securities, other than
            government securities and short-term debt securities having
            maturities of one year or less, for the year ended October 31, 2005,
            was $160,342,752.

      C.    Income Taxes - No federal tax provision is required as it is the
            Company's policy to comply with the provisions of Subchapter M of
            the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the
            distribution to its shareholders of substantially all of its income
            and any capital gains not offset by capital losses. Also, no state
            income tax provision has been provided because the states in which
            the Company has income recognize the tax exempt status of a
            regulated investment company.

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

      D.    Dividend Policy - It is the Company's policy to pay dividends during
            the year in sufficient amounts to meet the requirements to maintain
            its status as a regulated investment company.

      E.    Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of financial
            reporting, the Company considers all investments at financial
            institutions with original maturities of three months or less to be
            equivalent to cash. Short-term money market investments managed by
            third party investors are included in investment securities.

      F.    Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States of America requires management to make estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
            liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
            revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
            could differ from those estimates.

2.    LINE OF CREDIT

      On September 25, 2000 (modified on October 20, 2000 and renewed July 21,
      2005), the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for an unsecured
      line of credit in the amount of $10,000,000 to provide the Company more
      flexibility in its payment of dividends and management of its investments.
      The interest rate on any borrowings will be at the LIBOR market index rate
      plus 125 basis points. No commitment fee is charged on any unused balance.
      As of October 31, 2005, the Company had no borrowings from this line of
      credit, which expires on July 31, 2006.

3.    ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS

      The Company does not have an advisory board. The independent directors are

Item 4(e)(1) Exhibit

BMC FUND, INC.
AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY

To preserve the independence of the auditing firm engaged to provide audit
services to BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company"), the Audit Committee has established
the following policy:

1.    It is the policy of the Audit Committee that any engagement of an
      independent auditing firm to provide audit or non-audit services must be
      specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee in accordance with
      this Policy, except as specifically provided in paragraph 3 below.

2.    Consistent with this Policy, the Audit Committee must specifically approve
      in advance the terms and conditions of and fees for each audit engagement,
      as well as any changes in such terms, conditions and fees resulting from
      changes in audit scope, Company structure or other matters. The audit
      engagement letter may include the provision of audit services,
      audit-related services and non-audit services (such as review of the
      Company's tax returns), provided such non-audit services are not
      prohibited by Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (the "SEC").

3.    Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the independent auditors may provide, without
      further pre-approval by the Audit Committee, (i) subject to the last
      sentence of this paragraph, federal, state and local tax planning and
      advice, including but not limited to advice regarding the calculation of
      the amount of dividends and other distributions the Company is required to
      make in order to preserve its status as a regulated investment company
      under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, and (ii) services
      relating to the preparation, printing, mailing and filing of the Company's
      semi-annual report to shareholders as filed with the SEC, provided the
      total fees for services rendered in accordance with this paragraph 3 does
      not exceed $15,000 during any fiscal year. In no event may the independent
      auditors be retained (A) in connection with a transaction initially
      recommended by the independent auditors, the purpose of which may be tax
      avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported by the
      Internal Revenue Code, or (B) unless the separate pre-approval of the
      Audit Committee has first been obtained, to provide tax advice concerning
      mergers or acquisitions, restructurings, spin-offs or split-offs and other
      transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business.

4.    Management and the independent auditors will account for any service
      provided by the independent auditors by the following categories in order
      to enable the Company to satisfy its annual proxy statement disclosure
      obligations: Audit Services, Audit-Related Services, Tax Services and
      Other Services.

5.    Under no circumstances may the independent auditors perform any of the
      following non-audit services:
<PAGE>

*     Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
      financial statements of the audit client*

*     Financial information systems design and implementation*

*     Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind
      reports*

*     Actuarial services*

*     Internal audit outsourcing services*

*     Management functions

*     Human resources

*     Broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services

*     Legal services

*     Expert services unrelated to the audit

The Audit Committee, the independent auditors and management should consult the
SEC's rules and relevant guidance to determine the precise definitions of these
services and the applicability to the Company of exceptions to certain of the
prohibitions. The list of prohibited services set forth above is not exclusive.
Prohibited services also include any service that would cause the auditors to
(i) function in the role of management, (ii) audit their own work or (iii) serve
in an advocacy role for the Company.

6.    The independent auditors and the Chief Financial Officer or his or her
      designee will (i) submit to the Audit Committee written requests or
      applications for the independent auditors to provide services that require
      specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee, including a joint statement
      as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent
      with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, and (ii) inform the Audit
      Committee in writing, at least annually, of each service performed by the
      independent auditors pursuant to the general pre-approval by the Audit
      Committee in paragraph 3 of this Policy.

Adopted:  July 26, 2003
Revised:  January 31, 2004

*     Unless it is reasonable to conclude that the results of these services
      will not be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the audit
      client's financial statements.

Item 7 Exhibit

                                 BMC FUND, INC.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

      BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") invests in voting securities of a variety of
portfolio companies in order to achieve the Fund's investment objective of
providing a maximum level of income for shareholders consistent with maintaining
the Fund's long-term purchasing power. The Fund's Board of Directors, acting on
behalf of the Fund, has the right, and the obligation, to vote proxies relating
to the Fund's portfolio securities. The Board has delegated to the Investment
Committee and to the Treasurer and his or her designated representatives
(collectively referred to herein as the "Treasurer") proxy voting authority,
subject to the Board's continuing oversight. In discharging this authority, the
Investment Committee and the Treasurer must act in a manner that is consistent
with the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.

      The following policies will govern the Investment Committee's and the
Treasurer's voting of proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio securities:

General Policies

      1. Delegation of Proxy Voting Decisions: The Fund will not delegate proxy
voting decisions to any third party, including its external investment advisers.
Proxy voting decisions will be made on behalf of the Fund by the Investment
Committee or the responsible internal portfolio manager of the Fund, or by the
Treasurer of the Fund in accordance with these Policies or the direction of the
Investment Committee or the internal portfolio manager. The Investment Committee
or Treasurer may consider, to the extent deemed appropriate, recommendations of
nationally recognized institutional shareholder representative groups, such as
Institutional Shareholder Services, in determining how to vote proxies or how to
instruct the Treasurer to vote proxies.

      The Investment Committee will instruct the Treasurer how to vote proxies
with respect to securities acquired on behalf of the Fund by an external
investment adviser without consultation with such adviser. The responsible
internal portfolio manager or the Investment Committee (after consultation with
the responsible internal portfolio manager) will instruct the Treasurer how to
vote proxies with respect to securities acquired on behalf of the Fund.
Notwithstanding the above, the Treasurer may vote proxies in favor of the
recommendation of the board of directors of a portfolio company with respect to
the election of directors and the appointment or ratification of auditors
without specific instruction from the Investment Committee.

      2. Matters Affecting Shareholder Rights. If a portfolio company submits to
its shareholders a matter that, in the view of the Investment Committee or the
responsible internal portfolio manager, adversely affects the rights of the
portfolio company's shareholders as a whole, the Investment Committee or the
internal portfolio manager will cause the proxy to be voted against the
proposal. If the Fund's ownership of the portfolio securities represents more
than five percent of the portfolio company's outstanding voting securities, the
Investment Committee or responsible internal portfolio manager will notify the
portfolio company's management of the Fund's opposition to the proposal and
encourage the portfolio company to withdraw the proposal.


                                       1
<PAGE>

      3. Consideration of Views of Management of Portfolio Company. Except as
otherwise provided in these Policies, in considering how to vote a proxy
relating to a portfolio security, the Investment Committee or the responsible
internal portfolio manager will generally defer to the views of management of
the portfolio company if the portfolio security has performed in accordance with
the Fund's expectations (taking into account not only the performance of the
portfolio company but also industry and economic factors over which the
portfolio company has no control).

      4. Conflicts with Affiliated Persons. If a matter submitted to a vote of
the shareholders of a portfolio company presents a conflict between the
interests of the Fund's shareholders and the interests of any affiliated person
or investment adviser of the Fund, the Investment Committee or the responsible
internal portfolio manager will cause the proxy relating to the portfolio
security to be voted in accordance with the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders as a whole, without consideration of the interests of the
affiliated person or investment adviser. If the affiliated person of the Fund
whose interests conflict with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders is
a member of the Investment Committee or is an internal portfolio manager, such
person will recuse himself or herself from consideration of the matter.

      5. General Principle: The most important factor to be considered by the
Investment Committee and internal portfolio managers in evaluating how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities is the financial impact of the matter
on the Fund's investment. The Investment Committee and the internal portfolio
managers may also take into account non-financial considerations, including
those described in the Global Sullivan Principles of Corporate Social
Responsibility, but such factors are secondary to financial considerations.

Specific Policies

      The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will cause a proxy to be voted
against, or cause the Fund's authority to vote in favor to be withheld, for the
following issues when submitted to a shareholder vote:

      1. Classified Boards. The Fund believes that it is in the best interests
of the Fund and its shareholders for portfolio companies to be able to elect a
full slate of directors at each annual meeting.

      2. Dual Class Capitalization. The Fund believes that it is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders for portfolio companies to oppose
capital structures that diminish the rights of the Fund's voting shares.


                                       2
<PAGE>

      3. Golden Parachutes. The Fund believes that it is in the best interests
of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose proposals that would
grant excessive awards to employees in the event of termination of employment
following a change in control.

      4. Blank Check Preferred Stock. The Fund believes that it is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose blank check
preferred stock proposals, because this type of preferred stock gives the
company's board of directors discretionary authority over voting, conversion,
dividend and other rights at the time the stock is issued and is susceptible to
abuse. The Fund might vote in favor of this provision if the company's board
provides assurances that this provision would not be used without advance
shareholder approval in a change in control situation or that the voting rights
of a series of preferred stock are limited to one vote per share.

      5. Re-pricing of Outstanding Options. The Fund believes that it is in the
best interests of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose excessive
re-pricing of outstanding options for officers and directors, because doing so
usually would be inconsistent with the incentive nature of the stock option plan
as originally adopted and could result in unfair dilution of the Fund's
investment in the company.

      6. Supermajority Voting. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote
against supermajority voting provisions because the Fund believes that a simple
majority provides shareholders with a better means to effect change.

      The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote for the following issues
when submitted to a shareholder vote:

      1. Adoption or Extension of Shareholder Rights Plans. The Treasurer, on
behalf of the Fund, will vote for shareholder rights plans if shareholders are
given the opportunity to vote on the plan and the plan is subject to a limited
term and is tied to an overall corporate strategy.

      2. Stock-based Compensation Plans. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund,
will vote for stock-based compensation plans because the Fund believes in
providing appropriate equity incentives to corporate employees for increasing
shareholder value. The Treasurer will analyze each plan approval or plan
amendment to be sure that the stock-related compensation plan aligns the
interests of corporate management with those of the shareholders.

      3. Increases in Authorized Common Stock. The Treasurer, on behalf of the
Fund, will vote for increases in authorized common stock as long as the increase
is reasonable under the circumstances.

      4. Confidential Voting. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote
for confidential voting proposals because the Fund believes that shareholders
should have the right to vote in private, thus enabling them to maintain their
independence and, in the case of employee shareholders, to vote without fear of
retribution.

                                       3

Disclosure of Voting Policies

These Policies are available to shareholders of the Fund without charge, upon
request, by calling the Secretary of the Fund (collect at 828-758-6100,
extension 22). The Fund will mail a copy of these Policies by first class mail
to any shareholder requesting a copy within three business days after the
request is made. The Policies will also be available on the Securities and
Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov).

Exhibit 12(a)(1)

CODE OF ETHICS FOR
SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
OF BMC FUND, INC.

This Code of Ethics applies to the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, and principal accounting officer or controller (individually, a "Senior
Financial Officer" and collectively, the "Senior Financial Officers") of BMC
Fund, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the "Company"). Its purpose is to
promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with the law, particularly as
related to the maintenance of the Company's financial records and the
preparation of financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The obligations of this Code of Ethics supplement, but do not
replace, the Company's Code of Ethics applicable to all Access Persons.

1.    Senior Financial Officers are expected to carry out their responsibilities
      honestly and with integrity, exercising at all times their best
      independent judgment.

2.    Senior Financial Officers must avoid situations in which their own
      interests conflict, or may appear to conflict, with the interests of the
      Company. A conflict situation can arise when a Senior Financial Officer
      takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his
      or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
      when a Senior Financial Officer, or a member of his or her family,
      receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in
      the Company. In any case in which a Senior Financial Officer finds himself
      or herself with an actual or apparent material conflict of interest, he or
      she must promptly disclose it to the Chairman of the Audit Committee so
      that the Audit Committee may review the transaction or relationship. The
      Audit Committee will have final authority to determine how the situation
      should be resolved. In furtherance of the above, no Senior Financial
      Officer may:

      (a)   Work for, or receive payments for services or accept gifts of more
            than a nominal value from, any investment adviser or other provider
            of services to the Company or from any of the Company's portfolio
            companies.

      (b)   Serve on the board of directors or a similar body for an outside
            company or government agency, other than a non-profit or community
            organization, without the approval of the Audit Committee.

      (c)   Provide a gift to any person or entity that would violate any law.

3.    Senior Financial Officers are responsible for assuring full, fair,
      accurate, timely and understandable disclosure of relevant financial
      information to shareholders and investors. In particular they are
      responsible for assuring that the Company complies with SEC rules
      governing disclosure of financial information. Among other things, Senior
      Financial Officers shall:

      (a)   Establish and maintain internal controls and procedures and
            disclosure controls and procedures designed to assure that financial
            information is recorded, processed and transmitted to those
            responsible for preparing periodic reports and other public
            communications containing financial information so that they are
            complete, accurate, and timely.

      (b)   Oversee the appropriate personnel to help ensure that the internal
            controls and procedures and disclosure controls and procedures are
            being followed.

      (c)   Carefully review each periodic report for accuracy and completeness
            before it is filed with the SEC and carefully review each public
            communication containing financial information before it is
            released.
<PAGE>

      (d)   Promptly disclose to the Audit Committee and the Company's
            independent auditors any material weaknesses in, or concerns
            regarding, the Company's disclosure controls or internal controls.

      (e)   Never create or maintain secret or unrecorded funds, assets, or
            accounts, or intentionally make a payment or approve an invoice,
            expense report or other document that is incorrect, misleading or
            inaccurate.

      (f)   Comply at all times with applicable governmental laws, rules and
            regulations.

4.    Senior Financial Officers are responsible for promptly bringing to the
      attention of the Audit Committee or the full Board of Directors:

      (a)   Any matters that could compromise the integrity of the Company's
            financial reports;

      (b)   Any disagreement with respect to any material accounting matter; and

      (c)   Any violation of this Code of Ethics or of any law or regulation
            related to the Company's accounting or financial affairs.

5.    No Senior Financial Officer may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,
      harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the
      terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the
      employee (1) to provide information, cause information to be provided or
      otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the
      employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of law, including any
      rule or regulation of the SEC, or any provision of federal law relating to
      fraud against shareholders; (2) to file, cause to be filed, testify,
      participate in, or otherwise assist in a proceeding filed or about to be
      filed (with any knowledge of the employer) relating to an alleged
      violation of law, including any rule or regulation of the SEC, or any
      provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders; or (3) to
      make any report pursuant to the Company's Procedures for Reporting
      Complaints About Accounting and Auditing Matters.

6.    The Audit Committee shall approve any waiver or amendment of this Code of
      Ethics, and any such waiver or amendment shall be disclosed promptly, as
      required by law or SEC regulation.

7.    A failure by any Senior Financial Officer to comply with the laws or
      regulations governing the Company's business, this Code of Ethics or any
      other Company policy or requirement may result in disciplinary action,
      including termination, and, if warranted, legal proceedings. The Audit
      Committee will investigate violations and appropriate action will be taken
      in the event of any violations of this Code of Ethics.
