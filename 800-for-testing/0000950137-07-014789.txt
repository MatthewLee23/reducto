PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return with sales charges includes payment of the
maximum sales charge of 3.25 percent for Class A shares, an early withdrawal
charge of 3.00 percent for Class B shares (in year one and declining to zero
after year five), an early withdrawal charge of 1.00 percent for Class C shares
in year one, and combined distribution fees and service fees of up to 0.25
percent for Class A shares and up to 1.00 percent for Class B and C shares and a
service fee of up to 0.15 percent for Class IC shares. Effective 2/18/05,
contingent deferred sales charges for Class IB and Class IC shares have been
terminated. New investments are not available in Class IB and IC shares. Figures
shown above assume reinvestment of all distributions. The fund's adviser has
waived or reimbursed fees and expenses from time to time; absent such
waivers/reimbursements, the fund's returns would have been lower.

Fund Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2007

MARKET CONDITIONS

The senior loan market benefited from strong fundamental and technical factors
throughout most of the 12-month reporting period. Economic growth was generally
solid, slowing somewhat in the first quarter of this year, but accelerating
again in the second quarter. Inflation remained contained and the Federal Open
Market Committee (the "Fed"), while still concerned about potential inflation
risks, held the target federal funds rate steady at 5.25 percent, where it has
stood since June 2006.

In terms of the credit markets, corporate productivity increased, cash flows
continued to be strong, and borrowing costs remained low. In addition, the
overall credit quality in the market improved and default rates remained low.
Together, these factors turned out to be quite supportive of the senior loan
market. New-issue senior loan volume climbed throughout the period, setting new
records in each consecutive calendar quarter to reach an unprecedented $204
billion in the second quarter of 2007. As a result, supply for the first half of
2007 totaled $390 billion, a 55 percent increase over the first half of 2006.
Helping to fuel this heavy supply was a high amount of merger and acquisition
and private equity activity during the period, as well as record-setting second-
lien loan volume. The record supply was met by robust demand, as institutional
investors and traditional high-yield investors continued to be increasingly
active in the market. In fact, demand for senior loans surpassed the available
supply for much of the period, causing yield spreads to narrow from December
2006 through the end of June 2007. At that time, however, volatility in the
market rose and the demand/supply dynamics changed.

In our view, the increased volatility in the last month of the period was
primarily driven by technical factors in the market, as opposed to credit
fundamentals. The first of these factors is the size of the forward calendar
(transactions announced but not yet syndicated in the market). As of the end of
the reporting period, the forward calendar was rather large, which likely left
some buyers waiting on the sidelines until this supply comes to market. The
second and larger factor contributing to the recent volatility, in our opinion,
is an overall tightening of lending standards and an increasing demand for both
protection and higher compensation by investors. The well-publicized news of
stress in other segments of the credit markets--most notably the subprime
mortgage market--prompted investors to re-price risk across all credit markets.
While the senior loan market is completely separate from the subprime mortgage
market, the negative news in the subprime mortgage arena has caused lenders in
the senior loan market to tighten their credit standards and to demand higher
spreads over LIBOR as compensation for assuming any lending risk.

While the recent volatility has not been pleasant, we are pleased to see lenders
tighten their underwriting standards, and believe this is a healthy event for
the market as it may ultimately serve to improve credit quality and the
risk/reward relationship for loans. We have seen signs of greater stability in
the senior loan market in the weeks immediately following the end of the
reporting period, but all money markets remain relatively nervous. Overall, the
fundamentals of the loan market remain strong, credit quality continues to be
robust, and default rates continue to be at historic low levels.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund returned 4.06 percent for the 12 months ended July 31, 2007 (Class A
shares, unadjusted for sales charges).

The performance for the five share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The Fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results. See Performance Summary for standardized performance information.

We continued to adhere to our research-intensive investment process, employing a
bottom-up asset selection process driven by thorough analysis of individual
company fundamentals. We do, however, analyze overall sector and industry trends
as well and generally avoid those which we believe are vulnerable to cyclical
economic downturns. For example, we have taken a cautious approach to the auto
and airline industries during the period because of their susceptibility to high
fuel prices. Given the fall off in the residential housing market, we have also
generally avoided investments in the building and real estate sectors.

We have been very selective regarding investments in the healthcare industry,
particularly those assets with inherent reimbursement and regulatory risks.
Certain healthcare providers, however, are not exposed to these risks. One such
provider is a large hospital which, in our view, has a strong management team
and is well secured. We added this company to the portfolio during the period,
which resulted in an increase in the portfolio's exposure to the healthcare
sector. Otherwise, our bottom-up security selection process led to few changes
in the Fund's healthcare weightings. As of the end of the period, the printing
and publishing, beverage, food and tobacco, healthcare, and entertainment and
leisure sectors continued to be represented in the Fund's top holdings.

The Fund benefited from our use of leverage during the period. Leverage involves
borrowing at a floating short-term rate and reinvesting the proceeds at a higher
rate. We used this strategy on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance
                                                                               3

the Fund's dividend. Unlike other fixed-income asset classes, using leverage in
conjunction with senior loans does not involve the same degree of risk from
rising short-term interest rates since the income from senior loans adjusts to
changes in interest rates, as do the rates which determine the Fund's borrowing
costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall, borrowing costs would also
decline. The use of leverage may increase the Fund's volatility.) We might
reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality conditions to prevent
magnifying erosion of the Fund's net asset value. Over the course of the
reporting period, our use of leverage served to improve the Fund's current
yield.

In closing, it is important to note that the portfolio's overall credit quality
remains strong and its default rate is well below the market average, which is
at an all-time low. Going forward, we will continue to focus on seeking to
maintain a high quality, portfolio of issuers with stable cash flows, strong
management teams, and collateral value sufficient to help provide a solid second
way out in a default scenario.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Fund in
the future.

Expense Example

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments of Class A Shares
and contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions of Class B and Class C
Shares; and redemption fees; (2) ongoing costs, including management fees;
distribution and service fees; and other Fund expenses. This example is intended
to help you understand your ongoing cost (in dollars) of investing in the Fund
and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual
funds.

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period 2/1/07 - 7/31/07.

ACTUAL EXPENSE

The first line of the table below provides information about actual account
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES

The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense
ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not
the Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for
the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports
of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales
charges (loads) or contingent deferred sales charges or redemption fees.
Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs
only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning
different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your
costs would have been higher.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

At meetings held on April 17, 2007 and May 30, 2007, the Board of Trustees, and
the independent trustees voting separately, considered and ultimately determined
that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and
approved the continuance of the investment advisory agreement as being in the
best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In making its determination,
the Board of Trustees considered materials that were specifically prepared by
the investment adviser at the request of the Board and Fund counsel, and by an
independent provider of investment company data contracted to assist the Board,
relating to the investment advisory agreement review process. The Board also
considered information received periodically about the portfolio, performance,
the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and expenses of the
Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the investment advisory agreement over a
period of several months and the trustees held sessions both with the investment
adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and considering
the investment advisory agreement.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
existing and alternative breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee
schedule. The Board of Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund
and other investment companies and/or other products at different asset levels,
and considered the trends in the industry versus historical and projected assets
of the Fund. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the investment
adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the Fund. The
Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees,

 10
<PAGE>

evaluated all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group
of factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund and changes made
in the Fund's portfolio management team over time. The Fund discloses
information about its portfolio management team members and their experience in
its prospectus. The trustees also discuss certain other services which are
provided on a cost-reimbursement basis by the investment adviser or its
affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including certain accounting, administrative
and legal services. The Board has determined that the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the investment adviser support its decision to
approve the investment advisory agreement.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report and in
the Fund's prospectus. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser the
level of advisory fees for this Fund relative to comparable funds and other
products advised by the adviser and others in the marketplace. The trustees
review not only the advisory fees but other fees and expenses (whether paid to
the adviser, its affiliates or others) and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The
Fund discloses more information about its fees and expenses in its prospectus.
The Board has determined that the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund
support its decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the

                                                                              11
<PAGE>

profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are put
together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The trustees
discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses, including among
other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio management-related
expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated expenses both on an
aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that the analysis of the
investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory agreement.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
and growth prospects of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense
ratio and particularly the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its
review of the investment adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the
investment adviser how more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or
effectiveness of managing the Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee
level is appropriate relative to current and projected asset levels and/or
whether the advisory fee structure reflects economies of scale as asset levels
change. The Board has determined that its review of the actual and potential
economies of scale of the Fund support its decision to approve the investment
advisory agreement.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2007.

(i) 144A-Private Placement security which is exempt from registration under Rule
    144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(j) Non-income producing security as the stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(k) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents less
    than 0.1% of the net assets of the Fund.

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. Bank
    Loan ratings are unaudited.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

(b) Assumes reinvestment of all distributions for the period and does not
    include payment of the maximum sales charge of 3.25% or early withdrawal
    charge. On purchases of $1 million or more, an early withdrawal charge of 1%
    may be imposed on certain repurchases by the Fund made within eighteen
    months of purchase. If the sales charges were included, total returns would
    be lower. These returns include combined distribution and service fees of up
    to .25% and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would
    pay on Fund distributions or the repurchases by the Fund of Fund shares.

(c) Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
    variable rate senior loan interests.

(d) Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
    Borrowings) from the Fund's total assets and dividing by the total number of
    senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
    indebtedness.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2007

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. The Fund continuously offers Class A
Shares, Class B Shares and Class C Shares. Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares
are not continuously offered. Each class of shares differs by its initial sales
load, contingent deferred sales charges, the allocation of class-specific
expenses and voting rights on matters affecting a single class.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Fund
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Fund's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and notes
for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of
such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available,
Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent market
indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing sources
approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the
Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until the next interest rate
redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loans. Consideration of
comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of
deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have adjustment periods
comparable to the Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior
Loans are reviewed and approved by the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of
Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees. Credit default swaps are valued using market
quotations from brokers.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

                                                                              55

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2007 continued

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

    The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed
delivery" basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The
Fund will segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least
equal to the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments
until after payment is made. At July 31, 2007, the Fund had no when-issued or
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Fund acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Fund.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for
distribution and service fees, which are unique to each class of shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2007, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $1,072,209,351, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

    Due to a merger with another regulated investment company, a portion of the

    At July 31, 2007, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Fund declares daily and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, are
distributed at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains for book
purposes may include short-term capital gains, which are included in ordinary
income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended July 31, 2007
and 2006 was as follows:

</Table>

    Permanent differences, primarily due a portion of capital loss carryforward
expiring in the current year, resulted in the following reclassifications among
the Fund's components of net assets at July 31, 2007.

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $692,799
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses related to wash sale
transactions and gains or losses recognized on securities for tax purposes but
not for book purposes.

F. CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES During the year ended July 31, 2007, the
Fund's custody fee was reduced by $146,212 as a result of credits earned on cash
balances.

                                                                              57

repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $2,952,140,736 and
$1,846,257,938, respectively.

5. REPURCHASE OF SHARES

The Fund has a policy of making monthly repurchase offers ("Repurchase Offers")
for the Fund's common shares pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) of the 1940 Act, as
amended; until October 2006 Repurchase Offers had been made at quarterly
intervals.

    On June 23, 2006, the shareholders of the Fund approved an amendment to the
Fund's fundamental policy regarding the Fund's offer to repurchase its shares to
allow the Fund to repurchase its shares on a monthly basis. In addition, on June
7, 2006, the Fund obtained exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange
Commission to enable the Fund to conduct monthly Repurchase Offers, subject to
certain conditions. The Fund began conducting monthly offers to repurchase its
outstanding shares commencing in October 2006.

    The Repurchase Offers will continue to be for between 5% and 25% of the
Fund's outstanding shares; however, whereas the Fund's present intent for
quarterly offers was up to

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2007 continued

15% during any one quarter, the Fund's present intent for monthly offers is up
to 5% (although the initial two monthly Repurchase Offers were up to 10%,
provided, however, the aggregate percentage of common shares subject to
repurchase in any 3-month period will not exceed 25%). The repurchase request
deadline will be the third Friday of each calendar month (or the preceding
business day if such third Friday is not a business day). To accommodate monthly
Repurchase Offers, the Fund has shorter notice periods before each offer,
shorter repurchase periods and shorter payment periods after each offer. During
the year ended July 31, 2007, the Fund made one quarterly Repurchase Offer and
nine monthly Repurchase Offers as follows:

6. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Fund had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $122,180,300 as of July 31, 2007. The
Fund intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities, and liquid senior loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $4,909,286 as of July 31, 2007 is reported
as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

7. BORROWINGS

The Fund has entered into a $700 million Amended and Restated Revolving Credit
and Security Agreement to finance the repurchases of shares or to purchase
additional securities for investment purposes. This revolving credit agreement
is secured by the assets of the Fund.

    Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of the
credit line. For the year ended July 31, 2007, the Fund recognized commitment
fee expenses of approximately $1,801,500. For the year ended July 31, 2007, the
average daily balance of borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving
Credit and Security Agreement was $420,947,802 with a weighted average interest
rate of 5.34%.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters

                                                                              61

into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third party selling the
participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the
credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other persons
interpositioned between the Fund and the borrower.

    At July 31, 2007, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation

</Table>

9. DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN

Shares of the Fund are distributed by Van Kampen Funds, Inc. ("the
Distributor"), an affiliate of the Adviser. The Fund has adopted a distribution
plan (the "Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class
B Shares and Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, as amended, as if the Fund were an open-end investment
company. The Fund also has adopted a service plan (the "Service Plan") with
respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class
IC Shares. There is no Distribution Plan or Service Plan for Class IB Shares and
no Distribution Plan for Class IC Shares. All service fees under the Service
Plan applicable to Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class IC
Shares are currently being waived. For the year ended July 31, 2007, the
Distributor waived service fees of $1,762,769. This waiver is voluntary in
nature and can be discontinued at any time. Under the Distribution Plan and
Service Plan, the Fund pays distribution fees in connection with the sale and
distribution of its Shares and service fees in connection with the provision of
ongoing services to shareholders of each such class and the maintenance of
shareholder accounts.

    Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund may spend up to a
total of 0.25%, 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.15% (0.25% maximum) per year of the average
daily net assets of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC
Shares, respectively. Due to voluntary fee waivers by the Distributor, the
aggregate distribution and service fees are currently 0.00%, 0.75%, 0.75%, and
0.00% per year of the average daily net assets for Class A Shares, Class B
Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC Shares, respectively. Annual fees under the
Distribution Plan and Service Plan are accrued daily. The net annual fees for
Class B Shares and Class C Shares are paid monthly to the Distributor.

    The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet
reimbursed ("unreimbursed receivable") was approximately $565,700 and $2,889,500
for Class B Shares and Class C Shares, respectively. These amounts may be
recovered from future payments under the Distribution Plan. To the extent the
unreimbursed receivable has been fully recovered, any excess fees will be
refunded to the Fund on a quarterly basis.

10. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Fund may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as to
attempt to protect the Fund against possible changes in the market value of its
portfolio or to generate

 62
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2007 continued

potential gain. All of the Fund's portfolio holdings, including derivative
instruments, are marked to market each day with the change in value reflected in
unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Risks may arise as a result of the
potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

    The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes
or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit risk of
an issuer. A buyer of a credit default swap is said to buy protection by paying
periodic fees in return for a contingent payment from the seller if the issuer
has a credit event such as bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding obligations
or deteriorating credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a credit
default swap is said to sell protection and thus collects the periodic fees and
profits if the credit of the issuer remains stable or improves while the swap is
outstanding but the seller in a credit default swap contract would be required
to pay an agreed-upon amount, which approximates the notional amount of the swap
as disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of Investments, to the buyer
in the event of an adverse credit event of the issuer. The Fund accrues for the
periodic fees on credit default swaps on a daily basis with the net amount
accrued recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts.
Upon cash settlement of the periodic fees, the net amount is recorded as
realized gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statement of Operations. Net
unrealized gains are recorded as an asset or net unrealized losses are reported
as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value
of the swap contracts is reported as unrealized gains or losses on the Statement
of Operations.

    Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested
in the issuer directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general market risk,
counterparty risk and credit risk. If there is a default by the counterparty,
the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to
the transaction. In addition, all counterparties are required to pledge
collateral daily (based on the valuation of each swap) on behalf of the Fund
with a value approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain.
Reciprocally, when the Fund has an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Fund
has instructed the custodian to pledge cash or liquid securities as collateral
with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss.
Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap
valuations fluctuate. Restricted cash, if any, for segregating purposes is shown
on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

11. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

12. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position
must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is
effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance
allows

                                                                              63
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2007 continued

implementing FIN 48 in the fund's NAV calculations as late as the fund's last
NAV calculation in the first required financial statement period. As a result,
the Fund will incorporate FIN 48 in its semi annual report on January 31, 2008.
The impact to the Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently being
assessed.

    In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of investments, as
of July 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of July 31, 2007, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund as of July 31, 2007, the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Fund's Board of Trustees has determined that it has three "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Trustees: Rod Dammeyer, Jerry D. Choate and R. Craig Kennedy.

Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or identified as an audit committee
financial expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not impose on such person any duties,
obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations, and

of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)

1.   STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

     The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

     The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

     For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

     The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

     The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

- ----------
(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.

(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

     The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

     The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.

2.   DELEGATION

     As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.   AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

     In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4.   AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix
B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5.   TAX SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

     Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6.   ALL OTHER SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7.   PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided
by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8.   PROCEDURES

     All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer
will determine whether such services are included within the list of services
that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by
the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to provide services that
require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the
request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.  COVERED ENTITIES

     Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Asset Management

     -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

<PAGE>

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f) Not applicable.

(g) See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

(a) The Fund has a separately-designated standing audit committee established in
accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are: David
C. Arch, Rod Dammeyer, Howard J Kerr, Hugo F. Sonnenschein.

(b) Not applicable.

Item 6. Schedule of Investments.

Please refer to Item #1.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Fund's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are
as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.   POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. This Policy is reviewed and updated as necessary to address new and
evolving proxy voting issues and standards.

The MSIM entities covered by this Policy currently include the following: Morgan
Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Company, Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust
Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Private Limited,
Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM
Affiliate" and collectively referred to as the "MSIM Affiliates" or as "we"
below).

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds--collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies under this Policy pursuant to authority granted
under its applicable investment advisory agreement or, in the absence of such
authority, as authorized by the Board of Directors/Trustees of the MSIM Funds.
An MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA
account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the case of an account not
governed by ERISA, the investment management or investment advisory agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will vote
proxies in a prudent and diligent manner and in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which the MSIM Affiliates manage assets, consistent with

<PAGE>

the objective of maximizing long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy
Standard"). In certain situations, a client or its fiduciary may provide an MSIM
Affiliate with a proxy voting policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate
will comply with the client's policy.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as we may retain from time
to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers that specialize in
providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional
investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth research, global
issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While we may review and utilize the
recommendations of the Research Providers in making proxy voting decisions, we
are in no way obligated to follow such recommendations. In addition to research,
ISS provides vote execution, reporting, and recordkeeping.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - Voting proxies of companies
located in some jurisdictions, particularly emerging markets, may involve
several problems that can restrict or prevent the ability to vote such proxies
or entail significant costs. These problems include, but are not limited to: (i)
proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other than English;
(ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings; (iii)
restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction of
organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person; (v)
the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate our voting instructions. As a
result, we vote clients' non-U.S. proxies on a best efforts basis only, after
weighing the costs and benefits of voting such proxies, consistent with the
Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance in connection
with voting non-U.S. proxies.

II.  GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To promote consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, we follow
this Policy (subject to any exception set forth herein), including the
guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range of issues,
and provide general voting parameters on proposals that arise most frequently.
However, details of specific proposals vary, and those details affect particular
voting decisions, as do factors specific to a given company. Pursuant to the
procedures set forth herein, we may vote in a manner that is not in accordance
with the following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved by the
Proxy Review Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP will follow the procedures as described in Appendix A.

We endeavor to integrate governance and proxy voting policy with investment
goals and to follow the Client Proxy Standard for each client. At times, this
may result in split votes, for example when different clients have varying
economic interests in the outcome of a particular voting matter (such as a case
in which varied ownership interests in two companies involved in a merger result
in different stakes in the outcome). We also may split votes at times based on
differing views of portfolio managers, but such a split vote must be approved by
the Proxy Review Committee.

A. ROUTINE MATTERS. We generally support routine management proposals. The
following are examples of routine management proposals:

     -    Approval of financial statements and auditor reports.

     -    General updating/corrective amendments to the charter.

     -    Most proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, with the
          following exceptions. We may oppose proposals that relate to "the
          transaction of such other business which may come before the meeting,"
          and open-ended requests for adjournment. However, where management
          specifically states the reason for requesting an adjournment and the
          requested adjournment is necessary to permit a proposal that would
          otherwise be supported under this Policy to be carried out (i.e. an
          uncontested corporate transaction), the adjournment request will be
          supported. Finally, we generally support shareholder proposals
          advocating confidential voting procedures and independent tabulation
          of voting results.

<PAGE>

B. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     1.   Election of directors: In the absence of a proxy contest, we generally
          support the board's nominees for director except as follows:

          a.   We withhold or vote against interested directors if the company's
               board does not meet market standards for director independence,
               or if otherwise we believe board independence is insufficient. We
               refer to prevalent market standards, generally as promulgated by
               a stock exchange or other authority within a given market (e.g.,
               New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq rules for most U.S. companies,
               and The Combined Code on Corporate Governance in the United
               Kingdom). Thus, for a NYSE company with dispersed ownership, we
               would expect that at a minimum a majority of directors should be
               independent as defined by NYSE. Non-independent directors under
               NYSE standards include an employee or an individual with an
               immediate family member who is an executive (or in either case
               was in such position within the previous three years). A
               director's consulting arrangements with the company, or material
               business relationships between the director's employer and the
               company, also impair independence. Market standards
               notwithstanding, we generally do not view long board tenure alone
               as a basis to classify a director as non-independent. Where we
               view market standards as inadequate, we may withhold votes based
               on stronger independence standards.

          b.   Depending on market standards, we consider withholding support
               from or voting against a nominee who is interested and who is
               standing for election as a member of the company's compensation,
               nominating or audit committees.

          c.   We consider withholding support or voting against a nominee if we
               believe a direct conflict exists between the interests of the
               nominee and the public shareholders. This includes consideration
               for withholding support or voting against individual board
               members or an entire slate if we believe the board is entrenched
               and dealing inadequately with performance problems, and/or with
               insufficient independence between the board and management.

          d.   We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee
               standing for election if the board has not taken action to
               implement generally accepted governance practices for which there
               is a "bright line" test. In the context of the U.S. market, these
               would include elimination of dead hand or slow hand poison pills,
               requiring audit, compensation or nominating committees to be
               composed of independent directors and requiring a majority
               independent board.

          e.   We generally withhold support from or vote against a nominee who
               has failed to attend at least 75% of board meetings within a
               given year without a reasonable excuse.

          f.   We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee
               who serves on the board of directors of more than six companies
               (excluding investment companies). We also consider voting against
               a director who otherwise appears to have too many commitments to
               serve adequately on the board of the company.

     2.   Board independence: We generally support proposals requiring that a
          certain percentage (up to 66 2/3%) of the company's board members be
          independent directors, and promoting all-independent audit,
          compensation and nominating/governance committees.

     3.   Board diversity: We consider on a case-by-case basis proposals urging
          diversity of board membership with respect to social, religious or
          ethnic group.

<PAGE>

     4.   Majority voting: We generally support proposals requesting or
          requiring majority voting policies in election of directors, so long
          as there is a carve-out for plurality voting in the case of contested
          elections.

     5.   Proposals to elect all directors annually: We generally support
          proposals to elect all directors annually at public companies (to
          "declassify" the Board of Directors) where such action is supported by
          the board, and otherwise consider the issue on a case-by-case basis.

     6.   Cumulative voting: We generally support proposals to eliminate
          cumulative voting (which provides that shareholders may concentrate
          their votes for one or a handful of candidates, a system that can
          enable a minority bloc to place representation on a board). Proposals
          to establish cumulative voting in the election of directors generally
          will not be supported.

     7.   Separation of Chairman and CEO positions: We vote on shareholder
          proposals to separate the Chairman and CEO positions and/or to appoint
          a non-executive Chairman based in part on prevailing practice in
          particular markets, since the context for such a practice varies. In
          many non-U.S. markets, we view separation of the roles as a market
          standard practice, and support division of the roles in that context.

     8.   Director retirement age: Proposals recommending set director
          retirement ages are voted on a case-by-case basis.

     9.   Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden indemnification
          of directors. Generally, we will support such proposals provided that
          the officers and directors are eligible for indemnification and
          liability protection if they have acted in good faith on company
          business and were found innocent of any civil or criminal charges for
          duties performed on behalf of the company.

C. CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS AND PROXY FIGHTS. We examine proposals relating to
mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers,
spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations, restructurings and
recapitalizations) on a case-by-case basis. However, proposals for mergers or
other significant transactions that are friendly and approved by the Research
Providers generally will be supported and in those instances will not need to be
reviewed by the Proxy Review Committee, where there is no portfolio manager
objection and where there is no material conflict of interest. We also analyze
proxy contests on a case-by-case basis.

D. CHANGES IN LEGAL AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE. We generally vote in favor of
management proposals for technical and administrative changes to a company's
charter, articles of association or bylaws. We review non-routine proposals,
including reincorporation to a different jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.

     1.   We generally support the following:

          -    Proposals that eliminate other classes of stock and/or eliminate
               unequal voting rights.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of
               common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if:
               (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii) the
               number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to the
               purpose for which authorization is requested; and (iii) the
               authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently authorized
               and at least 30% of the new authorization will be outstanding.

          -    Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for
               issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital.

          -    Proposals to authorize share repurchase plans.

<PAGE>

          -    Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of common or
               preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred stock.

          -    Proposals to effect stock splits.

          -    Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
               proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in
               the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
               proportionately to the authorized share amount generally will be
               approved if the resulting increase in authorized shares coincides
               with the proxy guidelines set forth above for common stock
               increases.

          -    Proposals for higher dividend payouts.

     2.   We generally oppose the following (notwithstanding management
          support):

          -    Proposals that add classes of stock that would substantially
               dilute the voting interests of existing shareholders.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of existing
               classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or supervoting
               rights.

          -    Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

          -    Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

E. TAKEOVER DEFENSES AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

     1.   Shareholder rights plans: We support proposals to require shareholder
          approval or ratification of shareholder rights plans (poison pills).

     2.   Supermajority voting requirements: We generally oppose requirements
          for supermajority votes to amend the charter or bylaws, unless the
          provisions protect minority shareholders where there is a large
          shareholder. In line with this view, in the absence of a large
          shareholder we support reasonable shareholder proposals to limit such
          supermajority voting requirements.

     3.   Shareholder rights to call meetings: We consider proposals to enhance
          shareholder rights to call meetings on a case-by-case basis.

     4.   Anti-greenmail provisions: Proposals relating to the adoption of
          anti-greenmail provisions will be supported, provided that the
          proposal: (i) defines greenmail; (ii) prohibits buyback offers to
          large block holders (holders of at least 1% of the outstanding shares
          and in certain cases, a greater amount, as determined by the Proxy
          Review Committee) not made to all shareholders or not approved by
          disinterested shareholders; and (iii) contains no anti-takeover
          measures or other provisions restricting the rights of shareholders.

F. AUDITORS. We generally support management proposals for selection or
ratification of independent auditors. However, we may consider opposing such
proposals with reference to incumbent audit firms if the company has suffered
from serious accounting irregularities, or if fees paid to the auditor for
non-audit-related services are excessive. Generally, to determine if non-audit
fees are excessive, a 50% test will be applied (i.e., non-audit-related fees
should be less than 50% of the total fees paid to the auditor). Proposals
requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of shareholders will be
supported. We generally vote against proposals to indemnify auditors.

G. EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR REMUNERATION.

<PAGE>

     1.   We generally support the following proposals:

          -    Proposals relating to director fees, provided the amounts are not
               excessive relative to other companies in the country or industry.

          -    Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts
               up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a broad-based
               employee plan, including all non-executive employees.

          -    Proposals for employee equity compensation plans and other
               employee ownership plans, provided that our research does not
               indicate that approval of the plan would be against shareholder
               interest. Such approval may be against shareholder interest if it
               authorizes excessive dilution and shareholder cost, particularly
               in the context of high usage ("run rate") of equity compensation
               in the recent past; or if there are objectionable plan design and
               provisions.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
               severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate
               that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.

     2.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
          agreements will not be supported, but proposals that require
          shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the
          annual compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported.

     3.   Proposals advocating stronger and/or particular pay-for-performance
          models will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with consideration
          of the merits of the individual proposal within the context of the
          particular company and its current and past practices.

     4.   Proposals to U.S. companies that request disclosure of executive
          compensation in addition to the disclosure required by the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations generally will not be
          supported.

     5.   We generally support proposals advocating reasonable senior executive
          and director stock ownership guidelines and holding requirements for
          shares gained in option exercises.

     6.   Management proposals effectively to re-price stock options are
          considered on a case-by-case basis. Considerations include the
          company's reasons and justifications for a re-pricing, the company's
          competitive position, whether senior executives and outside directors
          are excluded, potential cost to shareholders, whether the re-pricing
          or share exchange is on a value-for-value basis, and whether vesting
          requirements are extended.

H. SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. We consider proposals relating to
social, political and environmental issues on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether they will have a financial impact on shareholder value. However, we
generally vote against proposals requesting reports that are duplicative,
related to matters not material to the business, or that would impose
unnecessary or excessive costs. We may abstain from voting on proposals that do
not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value. We
generally oppose proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are
not required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals relate.

<PAGE>

I. FUND OF FUNDS. Certain Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in
other MSIM Funds. If an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to
avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the
same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund,
unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

III. ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

The MSIM Proxy Review Committee (the "Committee") has overall responsibility for
creating and implementing the Policy, working with an MSIM staff group (the
"Corporate Governance Team"). The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief
Investment Officer of Global Equities ("CIO"), consists of senior investment
professionals who represent the different investment disciplines and geographic
locations of the firm. Because proxy voting is an investment responsibility and
impacts shareholder value, and because of their knowledge of companies and
markets, portfolio managers and other members of investment staff play a key
role in proxy voting, although the Committee has final authority over proxy
votes.

The Committee Chairperson is the head of the Corporate Governance Team, and is
responsible for identifying issues that require Committee deliberation or
ratification. The Corporate Governance Team, working with advice of investment
teams and the Committee, is responsible for voting on routine items and on
matters that can be addressed in line with these Policy guidelines. The
Corporate Governance Team has responsibility for voting case-by-case where
guidelines and precedent provide adequate guidance, and to refer other
case-by-case decisions to the Proxy Review Committee.

The Committee will periodically review and have the authority to amend, as
necessary, the Policy and establish and direct voting positions consistent with
the Client Proxy Standard.

A. COMMITTEE PROCEDURES

The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other matters) address any
outstanding issues relating to the Policy or its implementation. The Corporate
Governance Team will timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments
and/or any additional guidelines or procedures the Committee may adopt).

The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other matters): (1)
authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain shares of the same issuer that
are the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held by one or more MSIM
portfolios to be voted differently than other shares) and/or "override voting"
(i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the Policy); (2)
review and approve upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters for which
specific direction has been provided in this Policy; and (3) determine how to
vote matters for which specific direction has not been provided in this Policy.

Members of the Committee may take into account Research Providers'
recommendations and research as well as any other relevant information they may
request or receive, including portfolio manager and/or analyst research, as
applicable. Generally, proxies related to securities held in accounts that are
managed pursuant to quantitative, index or index-like strategies ("Index
Strategies") will be voted in the same manner as those held in actively managed
accounts, unless economic interests of the accounts differ. Because accounts
managed using Index Strategies are passively managed accounts, research from
portfolio managers and/or analysts related to securities held in these accounts
may not be available. If the affected securities are held only in accounts that
are managed pursuant to Index Strategies, and the proxy relates to a matter that
is not described in this Policy, the Committee will consider all available
information from the Research Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
significant, from the portfolio managers and/or analysts.

B. MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

<PAGE>

In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the Committee determines that
an issue raises a material conflict of interest, the Committee will request a
special committee to review, and recommend a course of action with respect to,
the conflict(s) in question ("Special Committee").

The Special Committee shall be comprised of the Chairperson of the Proxy Review
Committee, the Chief Compliance Officer or his/her designee, a senior portfolio
manager (if practicable, one who is a member of the Proxy Review Committee)
designated by the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's relevant Chief Investment
Officer or his/her designee, and any other persons deemed necessary by the
Chairperson. The Special Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's General
Counsel or his/her designee who will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In
addition to the research provided by Research Providers, the Special Committee
may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate investment professionals and outside
sources to the extent it deems appropriate.

C. IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

A potential material conflict of interest could exist in the following
situations, among others:

     1.   The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an affiliate of
          MSIM and the vote is on a material matter affecting the issuer.

     2.   The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any other security
          issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates except if echo voting is
          used, as with MSIM Funds, as described herein.

     3.   Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the matter
          submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial advisor to a party
          to a merger or acquisition for which Morgan Stanley will be paid a
          success fee if completed).

If the Chairperson of the Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
material conflict of interest, depending on the facts and circumstances, the
Chairperson will address the issue as follows:

     1.   If the matter relates to a topic that is discussed in this Policy, the
          proposal will be voted as per the Policy.

     2.   If the matter is not discussed in this Policy or the Policy indicates
          that the issue is to be decided case-by-case, the proposal will be
          voted in a manner consistent with the Research Providers, provided
          that all the Research Providers have the same recommendation, no
          portfolio manager objects to that vote, and the vote is consistent
          with MSIM's Client Proxy Standard.

     3.   If the Research Providers' recommendations differ, the Chairperson
          will refer the matter to the Committee to vote on the proposal. If the
          Committee determines that an issue raises a material conflict of
          interest, the Committee will request a Special Committee to review and
          recommend a course of action, as described above. Notwithstanding the
          above, the Chairperson of the Committee may request a Special
          Committee to review a matter at any time as he/she deems necessary to
          resolve a conflict.

D. PROXY VOTING REPORTING

The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s), will document in
writing all of their decisions and actions, which documentation will be
maintained by the Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s), for
a period of at least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate to a security
held by a MSIM Fund, the Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
will report their decisions to each applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of
those Funds at each Board's next regularly scheduled Board meeting. The report
will contain information concerning decisions made by the Committee and Special
Committee during the most recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding
the Board meeting.

<PAGE>

The Corporate Governance Team will timely communicate to applicable portfolio
managers and to ISS, decisions of the Committee and Special Committee so that,
among other things, ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any client requesting it.
MSIM will also, upon client request, promptly provide a report indicating how
each proxy was voted with respect to securities held in that client's account.

MSIM's Legal Department is responsible for filing an annual Form N-PX on behalf
of each MSIM Fund for which such filing is required, indicating how all proxies
were voted with respect to such Fund's holdings.

APPENDIX A

The following procedures apply to accounts managed by Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP
("AIP").

Generally, AIP will follow the guidelines set forth in Section II of MSIM's
Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures. To the extent that such guidelines do not
provide specific direction, or AIP determines that consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard, the guidelines should not be followed, the Proxy Review
Committee has delegated the voting authority to vote securities held by accounts
managed by AIP to the Liquid Markets investment team and the Private Markets
investment team of AIP. A summary of decisions made by the investment teams will
be made available to the Proxy Review Committee for its information at the next
scheduled meeting of the Proxy Review Committee.

In certain cases, AIP may determine to abstain from determining (or
recommending) how a proxy should be voted (and therefore abstain from voting
such proxy or recommending how such proxy should be voted), such as where the
expected cost of giving due consideration to the proxy does not justify the
potential benefits to the affected account(s) that might result from adopting or
rejecting (as the case may be) the measure in question.

Waiver of Voting Rights

For regulatory reasons, AIP may either 1) invest in a class of securities of an
underlying fund (the "Fund") that does not provide for voting rights; or 2)
waive 100% of its voting rights with respect to the following:

     1.   Any rights with respect to the removal or replacement of a director,
          general partner, managing member or other person acting in a similar
          capacity for or on behalf of the Fund (each individually a "Designated
          Person," and collectively, the "Designated Persons"), which may
          include, but are not limited to, voting on the election or removal of
          a Designated Person in the event of such Designated Person's death,
          disability, insolvency, bankruptcy, incapacity, or other event
          requiring a vote of interest holders of the Fund to remove or replace
          a Designated Person; and

     2.   Any rights in connection with a determination to renew, dissolve,
          liquidate, or otherwise terminate or continue the Fund, which may
          include, but are not limited to, voting on the renewal, dissolution,
          liquidation, termination or continuance of the Fund upon the
          occurrence of an event described in the Fund's organizational
          documents; provided, however, that, if the Fund's organizational
          documents require the consent of the Fund's general partner or
          manager, as the case may be, for any such termination or continuation
          of the Fund to be effective, then AIP may exercise its voting rights
          with respect to such matter.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                                 FUND MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Fund is managed by
members of the Taxable Fixed Income team. The team consists of portfolio
managers and analysts. Current members of the team jointly and primarily
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio and the
overall execution of the strategy of the Fund are Howard T. Tiffen, a Managing
Director of the Adviser and Christina Jamieson, an Executive Director of the
Adviser.

Mr. Tiffen has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since December 1999 and began managing the Fund in December 1999. Ms.
Jamieson has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since March 2000 and began managing the Fund in June 2005.

The composition of the team may change from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

As of July 31, 2007, Mr. Tiffen managed six registered investment companies with
a total of approximately $7.8 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles
other than registered investment companies; and one other account with a total
of approximately $586.7 million in assets.

As of July 31, 2007, Ms. Jamieson managed three registered investment companies
with a total of approximately $6.0 billion in assets; no pooled investment
vehicles other than registered investment companies; and no other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio managers may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Fund. The portfolio managers of the Fund do not currently manage accounts for
other investment companies, pooled investment vehicles or other accounts that
charge a performance-based fee. In addition, a conflict of interest could exist
to the extent the Adviser has proprietary investments in certain accounts, where
portfolio managers have personal investments in certain accounts or when certain
accounts are investment options in the Adviser's employee benefits and/or
deferred compensation plans. The portfolio manager may have an incentive to
favor these accounts over others. If the Adviser manages accounts that engage in
short sales of securities of the type in which the Fund invests, the Adviser
could be seen as harming the performance of the Fund for the benefit of the
accounts engaged in short sales if the short sales cause the market value of the
securities to fall. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies
and procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and
other conflicts of interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

BASE SALARY COMPENSATION. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

<PAGE>

- -    Cash Bonus;

- -    Morgan Stanley's Long-Term Incentive Compensation Program awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation into restricted stock units or other awards or other
     investments based on Morgan Stanley common stock that are subject to
     vesting and other conditions;

- -    Investment Management Alignment Plan (IMAP) awards -- a mandatory program
     that defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation and notionally
     invests it in designated funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates.
     The award is subject to vesting and other conditions. Portfolio managers
     must notionally invest a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 100% of the IMAP
     deferral into a combination of the designated open-end funds they manage
     that are included in the IMAP Fund menu;

- -    Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
     certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary
     year-end compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred
     amount: (1) across a range of designated investment funds, including funds
     advised by the Adviser or its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley
     stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- -    Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
     pre-tax investment performance of the funds/accounts managed by the
     portfolio manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three-
     and five-year periods measured against an appropriate securities market
     index (or indices) for the funds/accounts managed by the portfolio manager.
     The assets managed by the portfolio managers in funds, pooled investment
     vehicles and other accounts are described in "Other Accounts Managed by the
     Portfolio Managers" above. Generally, the greatest weight is placed on the
     three- and five-year periods.

- -    Revenues generated by the investment companies, pooled investment vehicles
     and other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Contribution to the business objectives of the Adviser.

- -    The dollar amount of assets managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Market compensation survey research by independent third parties.

- -    Other qualitative factors, such as contributions to client objectives.

- -    Performance of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley Investment Management
     Inc., and the overall performance of the investment team(s) of which the
     portfolio is a member.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

      AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005, SEPTEMBER 22, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2006

I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
     Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and each,
     a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, President,
     Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
     functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for
     the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly);

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; or

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

     -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
          board of any public or private company;

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events
          or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

          provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
          time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
          disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
          Funds;

     -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
          to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Directors/Trustees and
          auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting full,
          fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
          and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Funds; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or any
          employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
          violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
          reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
          "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
          "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
          relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
          recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other appropriate
          disciplinary actions;

     -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
          relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
          as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

- ----------
(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,

I, Ronald E. Robison, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
