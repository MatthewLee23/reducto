A Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder

It has been a tumultuous year for investors, marked by almost daily headlines
related to the beleaguered housing market, rising food and energy prices, and
the escalating credit crisis. The news took an extraordinarily heavy tone
shortly after the close of this reporting period as the credit crisis boiled
over and triggered unprecedented failures and consolidation in the financial
sector, stoking fears of a market and economic collapse and prompting the
largest government rescue plan since the Great Depression.

Through it all, the Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") has been aggressive in its
attempts to restore order in financial markets. Key moves included slashing the
target federal funds rate 325 basis points (3.25%) between September 2007 and
April 2008 and providing numerous cash injections and lending programs. As the
credit crisis took an extreme turn for the worse in September, the Fed, in
concert with five other global central banks, cut interest rates by 50 basis
points in a rare move intended to stave off worldwide economic damage from the
intensifying financial market turmoil. The U.S. economy managed to grow at a
slow-but-positive pace through the second quarter of the year, though the recent
events almost certainly portend a global economic recession.

Against this backdrop, U.S. stocks experienced intense volatility (steep
declines and quick recoveries), generally posting losses for the current
reporting period. Small-cap stocks fared significantly better than their larger
counterparts. Non-U.S. markets followed the U.S. on the way down and, notably,
decelerated at a faster pace than domestic equities -- a stark reversal of
recent years' trends, when international stocks generally outpaced U.S. stocks.

Treasury securities also traded in a volatile fashion, but rallied overall
(yields fell and prices correspondingly rose), as the broader flight-to-quality
theme persisted. The yield on 10-year Treasury issues, which fell to 3.34% in
March, climbed to the 4.20% range in mid-June as investors temporarily shifted
out of Treasury issues in favor of riskier assets (such as stocks and other
high-quality fixed income sectors), then declined again to 3.83% by period-end
when credit fears resurfaced. Tax-exempt issues posted positive returns, but
problems among municipal bond insurers and the collapse in the market for
auction rate securities pressured the group throughout the course of the past
year. Economic and financial market distress also dampened the performance of
high yield issues, which were very volatile due to the macro factors noted
above.

Overall, severe market instability resulted in mixed results for the major
benchmark indexes:

Fund Summary as of August 31, 2008
                                  BlackRock MuniHoldings Insured Investment Fund

Investment Objective

BlackRock MuniHoldings Insured Investment Fund (MFL) (the "Fund") (formerly
BlackRock MuniHoldings Florida Insured Fund) seeks to provide shareholders with
current income exempt from federal income tax. The Fund also seeks to offer
shareholders the opportunity to own shares, the value of which is exempt from
Florida intangible personal property tax. The Fund seeks to achieve its
investment objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of long-term,
investment grade municipal obligations, the interest on which, in the opinion of
bond counsel to the issuer, is exempt from federal income taxes and which
enables shares of the Fund to be exempt from Florida intangible personal
property tax. Due to the repeal of the Florida intangible personal property tax,
the Fund may satisfy its investment objective by investing in municipal
obligations issued by or on behalf of any state or its political subdivisions,
agencies and instrumentalities regardless of geographical location.

Performance

For the 12 months ended August 31, 2008, the Fund returned (4.68)% based on
market price and 1.16% based on net asset value ("NAV"). For the same period,
the closed-end Lipper Single-State Insured Municipal Debt Funds category posted
an average return of 1.32% on a NAV basis. All returns reflect reinvestment of
dividends. Several key factors influenced performance during the year. A
positive contributor was the Fund's significant overweight in pre-refunded bonds
in the one- to five-year maturity range, as the yield curve steepened and short-
and intermediate-maturity issues outperformed the rest of the market.
Conversely, problems within the monoline insurance industry had a negative
impact on the entire insured municipal market and thus, hampered the results of
the Fund and its peers. Health care, tax increment, housing and corporate-backed
bonds were among the sectors that underperformed the tax-exempt market over the
annual period. The Fund's discount to NAV, which widened during the period,
accounts for the difference between performance based on price and performance
based on NAV.

      this report and are subject to change based on changes in market, economic
      or other conditions. These views are not intended to be a forecast of

Fund Summary as of August 31, 2008
                              BlackRock MuniHoldings New York Insured Fund, Inc.

Investment Objective

BlackRock MuniHoldings New York Insured Fund, Inc. (MHN) (the "Fund") seeks to
provide shareholders with current income exempt from federal income taxes and
New York State and New York City personal income taxes by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which, in the opinion of bond counsel to the issuer, is exempt from federal
income taxes and New York State and New York City personal income taxes.

Performance

For the 12 months ended August 31, 2008, the Fund returned (5.72)% based on
market price and 1.74% based on NAV. For the same period, the closed-end Lipper
Single-State Insured Municipal Debt Funds category posted an average return of
1.32% on a NAV basis. All returns reflect reinvestment of dividends. Exposure to
longer-dated bonds detracted from results over the annual period, as these
securities proved more volatile when risk spreads increased and the municipal
yield curve steepened. Performance also was hampered by an above-average
exposure to select long insured bonds, which underperformed due to the monoline
insurers' credit woes and subsequent ratings downgrades. Conversely, the Fund's
above-average distribution rate benefited performance. Looking ahead, we believe
the Fund is well positioned to benefit amid a recovery in market liquidity, a
reversion to historical valuations versus Treasury issues and a continued
slowing economy. The Fund's discount to NAV, which widened during the period,
accounts for the difference between performance based on price and performance
based on NAV.

Fund Summary as of August 31, 2008                 BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc.

Investment Objective

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. (MVF) (the "Fund") seeks to provide shareholders
with as high a level of current income exempt from federal income taxes as is
consistent with its investment policies and prudent investment management by
investing primarily in a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal
obligations, the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxes in the
opinion of bond counsel to the issuer.

Performance

For the 12 months ended August 31, 2008, the Fund returned (5.63)% based on
market price and 0.51% based on NAV. For the same period, the closed-end Lipper
General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category posted an average return of
(0.98)% on a NAV basis. All returns reflect reinvestment of dividends. The
Fund's comparative performance reflects a relatively neutral duration position
versus its Lipper peers during a period of generally rising municipal bond
yields. The Fund's underweight in insured bonds positively impacted relative
performance as values on issues backed by monoline insurers declined
dramatically during the year. Additionally, the Fund's holdings of lower-rated
issues generated significant incremental income, which allowed the Fund to
maintain its above-average income distribution to shareholders. The Fund's
discount to NAV, which widened during the period, accounts for the difference
between performance based on price and performance based on NAV.

Fund Summary as of August 31, 2008
                           The Massachusetts Health & Education Tax-Exempt Trust

Investment Objective

The Massachusetts Health & Education Tax-Exempt Trust (MHE) (the "Fund") seeks
to provide shareholders with as high a level of current income exempt from both
regular federal income taxes and Massachusetts personal income taxes as is
consistent with the preservation of shareholders' capital. The Fund seeks to
achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in Massachusetts
tax-exempt obligations issued on behalf of participating not-for-profit
institutions. The Fund will continue to invest primarily in investment-grade
obligations. The Fund is intended to be a long-term investment and not a
short-term trading vehicle.

Performance

For the 12 months ended August 31, 2008, the Fund returned (2.38)% based on
market price and 0.84% based on NAV. For the same period, the closed-end Lipper
Other States Municipal Debt Funds category posted an average return of 1.93% on
a NAV basis. All returns reflect reinvestment of dividends. Detracting from the
Fund's performance over the year was exposure to the health care sector, which
underperformed the rest of the municipal bond market. On the positive side, the
Fund's significant overweight in pre-refunded bonds in the one- to five-year
maturity range benefited performance, as the yield curve steepened and short-
and intermediate-maturity issues outperformed. Additionally, exposure to the
education sector aided results as it was one of the stronger areas of the
market. The Fund's discount to NAV, which widened during the period, accounts
for the difference between performance based on price and performance based on
NAV.

      The views expressed reflect the opinions of BlackRock as of the date of
      this report and are subject to change based on changes in market, economic

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

The Funds may utilize leverage to seek to enhance the yield and NAV of their
Common Shares. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all interest rate
environments.

To leverage, each Fund issues Preferred Shares, which pay dividends at
prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments is paid to Common
Shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings
is reflected in the per share NAV of each Fund's Common Shares. However, in
order to benefit Common Shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped;
that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At the same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common Shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks of
leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits. If the yield curve becomes
negatively sloped, meaning short-term interest rates exceed long-term interest
rates, returns to Common Shareholders will be lower than if the Fund had not
used leverage.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Shares capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Shares for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Shares based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the
fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns income based on long-term interest
rates.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Shareholders are significantly
lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments, and therefore
the Common Shareholders are the beneficiaries of the incremental yield. However,
if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the differential between short-term
and long-term interest rates, the incremental yield pickup on the Common Shares
will be reduced or eliminated completely. At the same time, the market value of
the fund's Common Shares (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock
Exchange or the American Stock Exchange), may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Shares' NAV will
reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments, since the
value of the fund's Preferred Shares does not fluctuate. In addition to the
decline in NAV, the market value of the fund's Common Shares may also decline.

In addition, the Funds may leverage their assets through the use of tender
option bond ("TOB") programs. In a typical TOB program, the Fund transfers one
or more municipal bonds to a TOB trust, which issues short-term variable rate
securities to third-party investors and a residual interest to the Fund. The
cash received by the TOB trust from the issuance of the short-term securities
(less transaction expenses) is paid to the Fund, which invests the cash in
additional portfolio securities. The distribution rate on the short-term
securities is reset periodically (typically every seven days) through a
remarketing of the short-term securities. Any income earned on the bonds in the
TOB trust, net of expenses incurred by the TOB trust, that is not paid to the
holders of the short-term securities is paid to the Fund. In connection with
managing the Funds' assets, the Funds' investment advisor may at any time
retrieve the bonds out of the TOB trust typically within seven days. TOB
investments generally will provide the Funds with economic benefits in periods
of declining short-term interest rates, but expose the Funds to risks during
periods of rising short-term interest rates similar to those associated with
Preferred Shares issued by the Funds, as described above. Additionally,
fluctuations in the market value of municipal securities deposited into the TOB
trust may adversely affect the Funds' NAVs per share. (See Note 1 of the Notes
to Financial Statements for details of municipal bonds transferred to TOB
trusts.)

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Funds are permitted to issue
Preferred Shares in an amount up to 50% of their total managed assets at the
time of issuance. Under normal circumstances, each Fund anticipates that the
total economic leverage incurred from Preferred Shares and TOBs will not exceed
50% of its total managed assets. As of August 31, 2008, the Funds had leverage
from Preferred Shares and TOBs as a percentage of their total managed assets as
follows:

Swap Agreements

The Funds may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking physical custody
of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party with whom each
Fund has entered into a swap will default on its obligation to pay the Fund and
the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other
party to the agreement.

                           The Massachusetts Health & Education Tax-Exempt Trust

o     Effective January 1, 2008, the Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards
      Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value
      Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 clarifies the definition of fair value,
      establishes a framework for measuring fair values and requires additional
      disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. Various inputs are
      used in determining the fair value of investments, which are as follows:

      o     Level 1 -- price quotations in active markets/exchanges for
            identical securities

      o     Level 2 -- other observable inputs (including, but not limited to:
            quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
            not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
            the assets or liabilities (such as interest rates, yield curves,
            volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and
            default rates) or other market-corroborated inputs)

      o     Level 3 -- unobservable inputs based on the best information
            available in the circumstance, to the extent observable inputs are
            not available (including the Fund's own assumption used in
            determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. For
information about the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other
significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Financial Statements.

The following table summarizes the inputs used as of August 31, 2008 in
determining the fair valuation of the Fund's investments:

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

BlackRock MuniHoldings Insured Investment Fund ("MuniHoldings Insured")
(formerly BlackRock MuniHoldings Florida Insured Fund), BlackRock MuniHoldings
New York Insured Fund, Inc. ("MuniHoldings New York"), BlackRock MuniVest Fund,
Inc. ("MuniVest") and The Massachusetts Health & Education Tax-Exempt Trust ("MA
HEFA") (the "Funds" or individually the "Fund") are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as non-diversified,
closed-end management investment companies. The Funds' financial statements are
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which may require the use of management accruals and
estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Funds determine
and make available for publication the net asset value of their Common Shares on
a daily basis.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds:

Valuation of Investments: Municipal investments (including commitments to
purchase such investments on a "when-issued" basis) are valued on the basis of
prices provided by dealers or pricing services selected under the supervision of
each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees (the "Board"). In determining the value
of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with
respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from bond dealers,
pricing matrixes, market transactions in comparable investments and various
relationships between investments. Financial futures contracts traded on
exchanges are valued at their last sale price. Swaps are valued by quoted fair
values received daily by the Funds' pricing service or through brokers.
Short-term securities are valued at amortized cost. Investments in open-end
investment companies are valued at net asset value each business day.

In the event that application of these methods of valuation results in a price
for an investment which is deemed not to be representative of the market value
of such investment, the investment will be valued by a method approved by the
Board as reflecting fair value ("Fair Value Assets"). When determining the price
for Fair Value Assets, the investment advisor and/or sub-advisor seeks to
determine the price that each Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the
current sale of that asset in an arm's-length transaction. Fair value
determinations shall be based upon all available factors that the investment
advisor and/or sub-advisor deems relevant. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets
is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The Funds may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Funds and to hedge, or
protect, their exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the
securities markets. Losses may arise if the value of the contract decreases due
to an unfavorable change in the price of the underlying security or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- Each Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, a Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from, or pay to, the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as margin variation and are recognized by
      the Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the
      Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the
      value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time
      it was closed.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- Each Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, a Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. Changes in the value of the forward interest rate swap are
      recognized as unrealized gains and losses. When the agreement is closed,
      the Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount equal to the value
      of the agreement. The Fund generally intends to close each forward
      interest rate swap before the effective date specified in the agreement
      and therefore avoid entering into the interest rate swap underlying each
      forward interest rate swap.

Municipal Bonds Transferred to Tender Option Bond Trusts: The Funds leverage
their assets through the use of tender option bond trusts ("TOBs"). A TOB is
established by a third party sponsor forming a special purpose entity, into
which one or more funds, or an agent on behalf of the funds, transfers municipal
securities. Other funds managed by the investment advisor may also contribute
municipal securities to a TOB into which a Fund has contributed securities. A
TOB typically issues two classes of beneficial interests: short-term floating
rate certificates, which are sold to third party investors, and residual
certificates ("TOB Residuals"), which are generally issued to the participating
fund that made the transfer. The TOB Residuals held by the Funds include the
right of the Funds (1) to cause the holders of a proportional share of the
floating rate certificates to tender their certificates at par, and (2) to
transfer, within seven days, a corresponding share of the municipal securities
from the TOB to the Funds. The cash received by the TOB from the sale of the
short-term floating rate certificates, less transaction expenses, is paid to the
Funds, which typically invest the cash in additional municipal securities. The
Funds' transfer of the municipal securities to a TOB is accounted for as a
secured borrowing, therefore the municipal securities deposited into a TOB are
presented in the Fund's Schedules of Investments and the proceeds from the
transaction are reported as a liability of the Funds.

Interest income from the underlying securities is recorded by the Funds on an
accrual basis. Interest expense incurred on the secured borrowing and other
expenses related to remarketing, administration and trustee

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

services to a TOB are reported as expenses of the Funds. The floating rate
certificates have interest rates that generally reset weekly and their holders
have the option to tender certificates to the TOB for redemption at par at each
reset date. At August 31, 2008, the aggregate value of the underlying municipal
securities transferred to TOBs, the related liability for trust certificates and
the range of interest rates were as follows:

                                 Underlying
                                  Municipal      Liability
                                 Securities         for
                                 Transferred        Trust           Range of
                                   to TOBs      Certificates    Interest Rates
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MuniHoldings Insured .......    $126,629,644    $ 81,981,022     1.781% - 2.69%
MuniHoldings New York ......    $140,195,263    $ 87,056,319     1.739% - 2.84%
MuniVest ...................    $244,380,733    $133,548,787     1.681% - 2.766%
MA HEFA ....................    $  2,035,816    $  1,499,396              1.804%
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial transactions executed through TOBs generally will underperform the
market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment, but
tend to outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates decline
or remain relatively stable. Should short-term interest rates rise, the Funds'
investments in TOBs likely will adversely affect the Funds' investment income
and dividends to Common Shareholders. Fluctuations in the market value of
municipal securities deposited into the TOB may adversely affect the Funds' net
asset value per share.

Zero-Coupon Bonds: The Funds may invest in zero-coupon bonds, which are normally
issued at a significant discount from face value and do not provide periodic
interest payments. Zero-coupon bonds may experience greater volatility in market
value than similar maturity debt obligations which provide for regular interest
payments.

Segregation: In cases in which the 1940 Act and the interpretive positions of
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") require that the Funds segregate
assets in connection with certain investments (e.g., futures and swaps) or
certain borrowings, each Fund will, consistent with certain interpretive letters
issued by the SEC, designate on its books and records cash or other liquid debt
securities having a market value at least equal to the amount that would
otherwise be required to be physically segregated.

Investment Transactions and Investment Income: Investment transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual method. Each Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

Dividends and Distributions: Dividends from net investment income are declared
and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the ex-dividend
dates. Dividends and distributions to Preferred Shareholders are accrued and
determined as described in Note 4.

Income Taxes: It is each Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

Effective February 29, 2008, MuniHoldings Insured, MuniHoldings New York and
MuniVest implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). Effective June 30, 2008,
MA HEFA implemented FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold
a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for uncertainties in
income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity, including
investment companies, before being measured and recognized in the financial
statements. The investment advisor has evaluated the application of FIN 48 to
each Fund, and has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have a
material impact on each Fund's financial statements. Each Fund files U.S.
federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax returns are
currently under examination. The statute of limitations on the Funds' U.S.
federal tax returns remains open as follows: years ended August 31, 2005 through
August 31, 2007 for MuniHoldings Insured, MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest;
years ended December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2007 for MA HEFA. The
statutes of limitations on each Fund's state and local tax returns may remain
open for an additional year depending upon the jurisdiction.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2006, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Effective
January 1, 2008, MA HEFA adopted FAS 157. FAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. The impact on the financial statement disclosures for
MuniHoldings Insured, MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest, if any, is currently
being assessed.

In March 2008, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, "Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133" ("FAS 161"), was issued. FAS 161 is intended to improve
financial reporting for derivative instruments

by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors to understand how and
why an entity uses derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how
derivative instruments affect an entity's results of operations and financial
position. In September 2008, FASB Staff Position No. 133-1 and FASB
Interpretation No. 45-4 (the "FSP"), "Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and
Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB
Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement
No. 161," was issued and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
ending after November 15, 2008. The FSP amends FASB Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," to require
disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives
embedded in hybrid instruments. The FSP also clarifies the effective date of FAS
161, whereby disclosures required by FAS 161 are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November
15, 2008. The impact on the Funds' financial statement disclosures, if any, is
currently being assessed.

Deferred Compensation and BlackRock Closed-End Share Equivalent Investment Plan:
Under the deferred compensation plan approved by the Funds' Board,
non-interested Directors/Trustees ("Independent Directors/Trustees") may defer a
portion of their annual complex-wide compensation. Deferred amounts earn an
approximate return as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in
common shares of other certain BlackRock Closed-End Funds selected by the
Independent Directors/Trustees. This has approximately the same economic effect
for the Independent Directors/Trustees as if the Independent Directors/ Trustees
had invested the deferred amounts directly in other certain BlackRock Closed-End
Funds.

The deferred compensation plan is not funded and obligations thereunder
represent general unsecured claims against the general assets of each Fund. Each
Fund may, however, elect to invest in common shares of other certain BlackRock
Closed-End Funds selected by the Independent Directors/ Trustees in order to
match its deferred compensation obligations. Investments to cover the Fund's
deferred compensation liability are included in other assets on the Statements
of Assets and Liabilities. Dividends and distributions from the BlackRock
Closed-End Fund investments under the plan are included in income from
affiliates on the Statements of Operations.

Other: Expenses directly related to each Fund are charged to that Fund. Other
operating expenses shared by several funds are pro-rated among those funds on
the basis of relative net assets or other appropriate methods.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Other Transactions with Affiliates:

Each Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with BlackRock
Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc., to provide investment advisory services. Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. are principal
owners of BlackRock, Inc.

The Advisor is responsible for the management of each Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of each Fund. For such services, each Fund
pays the Advisor a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.50% for MA HEFA, 0.55% for
MuniHoldings Insured and MuniHoldings New York and 0.50% for MuniVest of each
Fund's average daily net assets. Average daily net assets is the average daily
value of the Funds' total assets minus the sum of its accrued liabilities.

The Advisor has voluntarily agreed to waive its investment advisory fee on the
proceeds of Preferred Shares and TOBs that exceeds 35% of the average daily net
assets of MuniHoldings Insured and MuniHoldings New York. These amounts are
included in fees waived by advisor on the Statements of Operations. For the year
ended August 31, 2008, the amounts were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MuniHoldings Insured ...............................................    $468,459
MuniHoldings New York ..............................................    $502,407
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Advisor has agreed to waive its advisory fee by the amount of investment
advisory fees each Fund pays to the Advisor indirectly through its investment in
affiliated money market funds. These amounts are included in fees waived by
advisor on the Statements of Operations. For the year ended August 31, 2008, the
amounts were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MuniHoldings Insured ...............................................    $112,428
MuniHoldings New York ..............................................    $ 66,107
MuniVest ...........................................................    $ 36,116
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Advisor has entered into a separate sub-advisory agreement with BlackRock
Investment Management, LLC ("BIM"), an affiliate of the Advisor, with respect to
MuniHoldings Insured, MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest, under which the
Advisor pays BIM for services it provides, a monthly fee at an annual rate that
is a percentage of the investment advisory fee paid by each Fund to the Advisor.

For the year ended August 31, 2008 and August 31, 2007 for MuniHoldings Insured,
MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest and for the period January 1, 2008 to August
31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007 for MA HEFA, the Funds reimbursed
the Advisor for certain accounting services. The reimbursements, which are
included in accounting services on the Statements of Operations, were as
follows:

Pursuant to the terms of the custody agreement for MA HEFA, custodian fees may
be reduced by amounts calculated on uninvested cash balances ("custody
credits"), which are on the Statements of Operations as fees paid indirectly.

Shares, voting as a separate class, are also entitled to elect two
Directors/Trustees for each Fund. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along
with approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of
the holders of a majority of any outstanding Preferred Shares voting separately
as a class, would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the Preferred Shares (b) change the Funds' subclassification as
a closed-end investment company or change its fundamental investment
restrictions or (c) change its business so as to cease to be an investment
company.

The Funds financed the Preferred Share redemptions with cash received from TOB
transactions.

Shares issued and outstanding during the years ended August 31, 2007 for
MuniHoldings Insured, MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest and December 31, 2007
and December 31, 2006 for MA HEFA remained constant.

Dividends on seven-day Preferred Shares are cumulative at a rate which is reset
every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividends on 28-day
Preferred Shares are cumulative at a rate that is reset every 28 days based on
the results of an auction. If the Preferred Shares fail to clear the auction on
an auction date, the Funds are required to pay the maximum applicable rate on
the Preferred Shares to holders of such shares for each successive dividend
period until such time as the shares are successfully auctioned. The maximum
applicable rate on all series of Preferred Shares, except MuniVest Series F, is
the higher of 110% of the AA commercial paper rate or 110% of 90% of the Kenny
S&P 30-day High Grade Index rate divided by 1.00 minus the marginal tax rate.
The maximum applicable rate on MuniVest Series F is the higher of 110% plus or
times (i) the Telerate/BBA LIBOR or (ii) 90% of the Kenney S&P 30-day High Grade
Index rate, divided by 1.00 minus the marginal tax rate. During the year ended
August 31, 2008 for each of the other Funds and the period January 1, 2008 to
August 31, 2008 for MA HEFA, the Preferred Shares of the Funds were successfully

Since February 13, 2008, the Preferred Shares of the Funds failed to clear any
of its auctions. As a result, the Preferred Shares dividend rates were reset to
the maximum applicable rate, which ranged from 2.458% to 5.060%. A failed
auction is not an event of default for the Funds but it has a negative impact on
the liquidity of Preferred Shares. A failed auction occurs when there are more
sellers of a fund's auction rate preferred shares than buyers. It is impossible
to predict how long this imbalance will last. A successful auction for the
Funds' Preferred Shares may not occur for some time, if ever, and even if
liquidity does resume, holders of the Preferred Shares may not have the ability
to sell the Preferred Shares at its liquidation preference.

5. Income Tax Information:

Reclassifications: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America require that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect
permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. These
reclassifications have no effect on net assets or on net asset values per share.
The following permanent differences as of August 31, 2008 attributable to the
expiration of capital loss carryforwards, amortization methods on fixed income
securities, the reclassification of distributions and the classification of
income were reclassified to the following accounts:

*     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized losses is

      tax deferral of losses on straddles, the difference between book and tax
      amortization methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income
      securities, the deferral of post-October capital losses for tax purposes,
      the deferral of compensation to trustees, the difference between book and
      tax treatment of residual interests in tender option bond trusts and other
      book/tax temporary differences.

As of August 31, 2008, the Funds had capital loss carryforwards available to
offset future realized capital gains through the indicated expiration dates:

6. Concentration Risk:

Each Fund's investments are concentrated in certain states which may be affected
by adverse financial, social, environmental, economic, regulatory and political
factors.

Many municipalities insure repayment of their bonds, which reduces the risk of
loss due to issuer default. The market value of these bonds may fluctuate for
other reasons, including market perception of the value of

On September 12, 2008, the Board of MuniHoldings Insured and MuniHoldings New
York voted unanimously to change certain investment guidelines of the Funds.
Under normal circumstances, the Funds are required to invest at least 80% of
their assets in municipal bonds either (i) insured under an insurance policy
purchased by the Funds or (ii) insured under an insurance policy obtained by the
issuer of the municipal bond or any other party. Historically, the Funds have
had an additional non-fundamental investment policy limiting its purchase of
insured municipal bonds to those bonds insured by insurance providers with
claims-paying abilities rated AAA at the time of investment.

Following the onset of the credit and liquidity crises currently troubling the
financial markets, the applicable rating agencies lowered the claims-paying
ability rating of most of the municipal bond insurance providers below the
highest rating category. As a result, the Advisor recommended, and the Board
approved, an amended policy with respect to the purchase of insured municipal
bonds that such bonds must be insured by insurance providers or other entities
with claims-paying abilities rated at least investment grade. This investment
grade restriction is measured at the time of investment, and the Funds will not
be required to dispose of municipal bonds they hold in the event of subsequent
downgrades. These approved changes do not alter the Funds' investment
objectives. Due to the recent downgrades, some of the insurers insuring a
portion of the Funds' current holdings are already rated below the highest
rating category.

In addition, on September 12, 2008, the Board of MuniHoldings Insured (formerly
BlackRock MuniHoldings Florida Insured Fund) voted unanimously to change a
non-fundamental investment policy of the Fund, and to rename the Fund "BlackRock
MuniHoldings Insured Investment Fund." The Fund's previous policy required the
Fund, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of its assets in
Florida municipal bonds insured by insurers with claims-paying abilities rated
AAA at the time of investment. Due to the repeal of the Florida Intangible
Personal Property Tax as of January 2007, the Board has approved an amended
policy allowing the Fund flexibility to invest in municipal obligations
regardless of geographic location, as well as revising the policy with respect
to the claims-paying ability rating adopted by the Fund. This approved change
does not alter the Fund's investment objective. Under current market conditions,
the Advisor anticipates that it will gradually reposition the Fund's portfolio
over time and that during such period, the Fund may continue to hold a
substantial portion of its assets in Florida municipal bonds. At this time, it
is uncertain how long the repositioning may take, and the Fund will continue to
be subject to risks associated with investing a significant portion of its
assets in Florida municipal bonds until the repositioning is complete.

The Advisor and the Board believe the amended policies will allow the Advisor to
better manage the Funds' portfolios in the best interests of the Funds'
shareholders and meet the Funds' investment objectives.

On September 15, 2008, Bank of America Corporation announced that it has agreed
to acquire Merrill Lynch, one of the principal owners of BlackRock, Inc. The
purchase has been approved by the directors of both companies. Subject to
shareholder and regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2009.

As of August 31, 2008, MuniVest held bonds guaranteed by Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") valued at $4,021,063. On September 15, 2008, Lehman
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which adversely impacted the value of the
bonds. Collectability of principal and interest on these bonds is not
guaranteed.

used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures include confirmation of
the securities owned as of August 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of

highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, and for
BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. the statement of cash flows for the year then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Additionally, in our opinion, the financial statements and
financial highlights referred to above, present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of The Massachusetts Health & Education
Tax-Exempt Trust as of August 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the
period January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2008 and for the year ended December 31,
2007, the changes in its net assets for the period January 1, 2008 to August 31,
2008 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and
the financial highlights for the period January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2008 and
for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory Agreement

The Board of Trustees or the Board of Directors, as the case may be
(collectively, the "Board," the members of which are referred to as "Directors")
of The Massachusetts Health & Education Tax-Exempt Trust ("MHE"), BlackRock
MuniHoldings Insured Investment Fund (formerly, BlackRock MuniHoldings Florida
Insured Fund) ("MFL"), BlackRock MuniHoldings New York Insured Fund, Inc.
("MHN") and BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. ("MVF," and together with MHE, MFL and
MHN, the "Funds") met in April and May 2008 to consider approving the
continuation of each Fund's investment advisory agreement (each, an "Advisory
Agreement") with BlackRock Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor"), each Fund's investment
advisor. The Board also considered the approval of each Fund's subadvisory
agreement (each, a "Subadvisory Agreement" and, together with the "Advisory
Agreement," the "Agreements") between the Advisor and BlackRock Investment
Management, LLC (the "Subadvisor"). The Advisor and the Subadvisor are
collectively referred to herein as the "Advisors" and, together with BlackRock,
Inc., "BlackRock."

Disclosure regarding MHE's Investment Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory
Agreement can be found in its most recent semi-annual report dated June 30, 2008
and is incorporated herein by reference.

Activities and Composition of the Board

The Board of each Fund consists of thirteen individuals, eleven of whom are not
"interested persons" of the Funds as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act") (the "Independent Directors"). The Directors are
responsible for the oversight of the operations of the Funds and perform the
various duties imposed on the directors of investment companies by the 1940 Act.
The Independent Directors have retained independent legal counsel to assist them
in connection with their duties. The Chairman of the Board is an Independent
Director. The Board has established four standing committees: an Audit
Committee, a Governance and Nominating Committee, a Compliance Committee and a
Performance Oversight Committee.

Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory Agreement

Upon the consummation of the combination of BlackRock, Inc.'s investment
management business with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.'s investment management
business, including Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, L.P., and certain
affiliates, each Fund entered into an Advisory Agreement and a Subadvisory
Agreement, each with an initial two-year term. Consistent with the 1940 Act,
after the Advisory Agreement's and Subadvisory Agreement's respective initial
two-year term, the Board is required to consider the continuation of each Fund's
Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory Agreement on an annual basis. In connection
with this process, the Board assessed, among other things, the nature, scope and
quality of the services provided to each Fund by the personnel of BlackRock and
its affiliates, including investment advisory services, administrative services,
secondary market support services, oversight of fund accounting and custody, and
assistance in meeting legal and regulatory requirements. The Board also received
and assessed information regarding the services provided to each Fund by certain
unaffiliated service providers.

Throughout the year, the Board also considered a range of information in
connection with its oversight of the services provided by BlackRock and its
affiliates. Among the matters the Board considered were: (a) investment
performance for one-, three- and five-year periods, as applicable, against peer
funds, as well as senior management and portfolio managers' analysis of the
reasons for underperformance, if applicable; (b) fees, including advisory,
administration and other fees paid to BlackRock and its affiliates by each Fund,
as applicable; (c) Fund operating expenses paid to third parties; (d) the
resources devoted to and compliance reports relating to each Fund's investment
objective, policies and restrictions; (e) each Fund's compliance with its Code
of Ethics and compliance policies and procedures; (f) the nature, cost and
character of non-investment management services provided by BlackRock and its
affiliates; (g) BlackRock's and other service providers' internal controls; (h)
BlackRock's implementation of the proxy voting guidelines approved by the Board;
(i) execution quality; (j) valuation and liquidity procedures; and (k) reviews
of BlackRock's business, including BlackRock's response to the increasing scale
of its business.

Board Considerations in Approving the Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory
Agreement

To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreements, the Directors received
information from BlackRock in advance of the April 22, 2008 meeting which
detailed, among other things, the organization, business lines and capabilities
of the Advisors, including: (a) the responsibilities of various departments and
key personnel and biographical information relating to key personnel; (b)
financial statements for BlackRock; (c) the advisory and/or administrative fees
paid by each Fund to the Advisors, including comparisons, compiled by Lipper
Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent third party, with the management fees, which
include advisory and administration fees, of funds with similar investment
objectives ("Peers"); (d) the profitability of BlackRock and certain industry
profitability analyses for advisors to registered investment companies; (e) the
expenses of BlackRock in providing various services; (f) non-investment advisory
reimbursements, if applicable, and "fallout" benefits to BlackRock; (g)
economies of scale, if any, generated through the Advisors' management of all of
the BlackRock closed-end funds (the "Fund Complex"); (h) the expenses of each
Fund, including comparisons of each such Fund's expense ratios (both before and
after any fee waivers) with the expense ratios of its Peers; (i) an internal
comparison of management fees classified by Lipper, if applicable; and (j) each
Fund's performance for the past one-, three- and five-year periods, as
applicable, as well as each Fund's performance compared to its Peers.

The Board also considered other matters it deemed important to the approval
process, where applicable, such as payments made to BlackRock or its affiliates
relating to the distribution of Fund shares, services related to the valuation
and pricing of Fund portfolio holdings, and direct and indirect benefits to
BlackRock and its affiliates from their relationship with the Funds.

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory Agreement
(continued)

In addition to the foregoing materials, independent legal counsel to the
Independent Directors provided a legal memorandum outlining, among other things,
the duties of the Board under the 1940 Act, as well as the general principles of
relevant law in reviewing and approving advisory contracts, the requirements of
the 1940 Act in such matters, an advisor's fiduciary duty with respect to
advisory agreements and compensation, and the standards used by courts in
determining whether investment company boards of directors have fulfilled their
duties and the factors to be considered by boards in voting on advisory
agreements.

The Independent Directors reviewed this information and discussed it with
independent legal counsel prior to the meeting on April 22, 2008. At the Board
meeting on April 22, 2008, BlackRock made a presentation to and responded to
questions from the Board. Following the meeting on April 22, 2008, the Board
presented BlackRock with questions and requests for additional information.
BlackRock responded to these requests with additional written materials provided
to the Directors prior to the meetings on May 29 and 30, 2008. At the Board
meetings on May 29 and 30, 2008, BlackRock responded to further questions from
the Board. In connection with BlackRock's presentations, the Board considered
each Agreement and, in consultation with independent legal counsel, reviewed the
factors set out in judicial decisions and Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") statements relating to the renewal of the Agreements.

Matters Considered by the Board

In connection with its deliberations with respect to the Agreements, the Board
considered all factors it believed relevant with respect to each Fund, including
the following: the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the
Advisors; the investment performance of each Fund; the costs of the services to
be provided and profits to be realized by the Advisors and their affiliates from
their relationship with the Funds; the extent to which economies of scale would
be realized as the Fund Complex grows; and whether BlackRock realizes other
benefits from its relationship with the Funds.

A. Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services: In evaluating the nature, extent
and quality of the Advisors' services, the Board reviewed information concerning
the types of services that the Advisors provide and are expected to provide to
each Fund, narrative and statistical information concerning each Fund's
performance record and how such performance compares to each Fund's Peers,
information describing BlackRock's organization and its various departments, the
experience and responsibilities of key personnel and available resources. The
Board noted the willingness of the personnel of BlackRock to engage in open,
candid discussions with the Board. The Board further considered the quality of
the Advisors' investment process in making portfolio management decisions.

In addition to advisory services, the Directors considered the quality of the
administrative and non-investment advisory services provided to the Funds. The
Advisors and their affiliates provided each Fund with such administrative and
other services, as applicable (in addition to any such services provided by
others for the Funds), and officers and other personnel as are necessary for the
operations of the respective Fund. In addition to investment management
services, the Advisors and their affiliates provided each Fund with services
such as: preparing shareholder reports and communications, including annual and
semi-annual financial statements and the Funds' websites; communications with
analysts to support secondary market trading; assisting with daily accounting
and pricing; preparing periodic filings with regulators and stock exchanges;
overseeing and coordinating the activities of other service providers;
administering and organizing Board meetings and preparing the Board materials
for such meetings; providing legal and compliance support (such as helping to
prepare proxy statements and responding to regulatory inquiries); and performing
other Fund administrative tasks necessary for the operation of the respective
Fund (such as tax reporting and fulfilling regulatory filing requirements). The
Board considered the Advisors' policies and procedures for assuring compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.

B. The Investment Performance of the Funds and BlackRock: As previously noted,
the Board received performance information regarding each Fund and its Peers.
Among other things, the Board received materials reflecting each Fund's historic
performance and each Fund's one-, three- and five-year total returns (as
applicable) relative to its Peers (including the Peers' median performance). The
Board was provided with a description of the methodology used by Lipper to
select each Fund's Peers. The Board noted that it regularly reviews the
performance of each Fund throughout the year. The Board reviewed a narrative and
statistical analysis of the Lipper data that was prepared by BlackRock, which
analyzed various factors that affect Lipper rankings.

The Board noted that although MFL, MHN, and MVF underperformed their respective
Peers in at least two of the one-, three- and five-year periods reported, the
Funds outperformed their respective Peers in a subset of the Lipper universe in
at least two of such periods based on a customized performance comparison
provided by BlackRock which gives a greater significance to current
distributions, providing a more accurate comparison.

C. Consideration of the Advisory Fees and the Cost of the Services and Profits
to be Realized by BlackRock and its Affiliates from their Relationship with the
Funds: In evaluating the management fees and expenses that each Fund is expected
to bear, the Board considered each Fund's current management fee structure and
each Fund's expense ratios in absolute terms as well as relative to the fees and
expense ratios of its applicable Peers. The Board, among other things, reviewed
comparisons of each Fund's gross management fees before and after any applicable
reimbursements and fee waivers and total expense ratios before and after any
applicable waivers with those of applicable Peers. The Board also reviewed a
narrative analysis of the Peer rankings prepared by Lipper and summarized by
BlackRock at the request of the Board. This summary

<PAGE>

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory Agreement
(concluded)

placed the Peer rankings into context by analyzing various factors that affect
these comparisons.

The Board noted that each of MFL, MHN, and MVF paid contractual management fees
lower than or equal to the median contractual fees paid by each Fund's
respective Peers. This comparison was made without giving effect to any expense
reimbursements or fee waivers.

The Board also compared the management fees charged and services provided by the
Advisors to closed-end funds in general versus other types of clients (such as
open-end investment companies and separately managed institutional accounts) in
similar investment categories. The Board noted certain differences in services
provided and costs incurred by the Advisor with respect to closed-end funds
compared to these other types of clients and the reasons for such differences.

In connection with the Board's consideration of the fees and expense
information, the Board reviewed the considerable investment management
experience of the Advisors and considered the high level of investment
management, administrative and other services provided by the Advisors.

D. Profitability of BlackRock: The Board also considered BlackRock's
profitability in conjunction with its review of fees. The Board reviewed
BlackRock's profitability with respect to the Fund Complex and other fund
complexes managed by the Advisors. In reviewing profitability, the Board
recognized that one of the most difficult issues in determining profitability is
establishing a method of allocating expenses. The Board also reviewed
BlackRock's assumptions and methodology of allocating expenses, noting the
inherent limitations in allocating costs among various advisory products. The
Board also recognized that individual fund or product line profitability of
other advisors is generally not publicly available.

The Board recognized that profitability may be affected by numerous factors
including, among other things, the types of funds managed, expense allocations
and business mix, and therefore comparability of profitability is somewhat
limited. Nevertheless, to the extent available, the Board considered BlackRock's
operating margin compared to the operating margin estimated by BlackRock for a
leading investment management firm whose operations consist primarily of
advising closed-end funds. The comparison indicated that BlackRock's operating
margin was approximately the same as the operating margin of such firm.

In evaluating the reasonableness of the Advisors' compensation, the Board also
considered any other revenues paid to the Advisors, including partial
reimbursements paid to the Advisors for certain non-investment advisory
services, if applicable. The Board noted that these payments were less than the
Advisors' costs for providing these services. The Board also considered indirect
benefits (such as soft dollar arrangements) that the Advisors and their
affiliates are expected to receive, which are attributable to their management
of the Fund.

E. Economies of Scale: In reviewing each Fund's fees and expenses, the Board
examined the potential benefits of economies of scale, and whether any economies
of scale should be reflected in the Fund's fee structure, for example through
the use of breakpoints for the Fund or the Fund Complex. In this regard, the
Board reviewed information provided by BlackRock, noting that most closed-end
fund complexes do not have fund-level breakpoints because closed-end funds
generally do not experience substantial growth after their initial public
offering and each fund is managed independently consistent with its own
investment objectives. The Board noted that only three closed-end funds in the
Fund Complex have breakpoints in their fee structures. Information provided by
Lipper also revealed that only one closed-end fund complex used a complex-level
breakpoint structure. The Board found, based on its review of comparable funds,
that each Fund's management fee is appropriate in light of the scale of the
respective Fund.

F. Other Factors: In evaluating fees, the Board also considered indirect
benefits or profits the Advisors or their affiliates may receive as a result
of their relationships with the Funds ("fall-out benefits"). The Directors,
including the Independent Directors, considered the intangible benefits that
accrue to the Advisors and their affiliates by virtue of their relationships
with the Funds, including potential benefits accruing to the Advisors and their
affiliates as a result of participating in offerings of the Funds' shares,
potentially stronger relationships with members of the broker-dealer community,
increased name recognition of the Advisors and their affiliates, enhanced sales
of other investment funds and products sponsored by the Advisors and their
affiliates and increased assets under management which may increase the benefits
realized by the Advisors from soft dollar arrangements with broker-dealers. The
Board also considered the unquantifiable nature of these potential benefits.

Conclusion with Respect to the Agreements

In reviewing and approving the continuation of the Agreements, the Directors did
not identify any single factor discussed above as all-important or controlling,
but considered all factors together, and different Directors may have attributed
different weights to the various factors considered. The Independent Directors
were also assisted by the advice of independent legal counsel in making this
determination. The Directors, including the Independent Directors, unanimously
determined that each of the factors described above, in light of all the other
factors and all of the facts and circumstances applicable to each respective
Fund, was acceptable for each Fund and supported the Directors' conclusion that
the terms of each Agreement were fair and reasonable, that each Fund's fees are
reasonable in light of the services provided to the respective Fund and that
each Agreement should be approved.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

For MuniHoldings Insured, MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest

How the Plan Works -- The Funds offer a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by MuniHoldings Insured,
MuniHoldings New York and MuniVest are automatically reinvested in additional
Common Shares of the Fund. The Plan is administered on behalf of the
shareholders by BNY Mellon Shareowner Services (the "Plan Agent"). Under the
Plan, whenever a Fund declares a dividend, participants in the Plan will receive
the equivalent in Common Shares of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the
shares for the participant's account either (i) through receipt of additional
unissued but authorized shares of the Funds ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by
purchase of outstanding Common Shares on the open market on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset
value per share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus
estimated brokerage commissions (a condition often referred to as a "market
premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
shares. If the Fund's net asset value per share is greater than the market price
per share (a condition often referred to as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent
will invest the dividend amount by purchasing on the open market additional
shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount in open
market purchases, or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during
the purchase period, the Plan Agent will invest any uninvested portion in newly
issued shares. The shares acquired are credited to each shareholder's account.
The amount credited is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend
by either (i) when the shares are newly issued, the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued or (ii) when shares are purchased in the open
market, the average purchase price per share.

Participation in the Plan -- Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
Common Shares of the Funds unless the shareholder specifically elects not to
participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will receive
all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to participate
in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address set forth
below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation in the Plan
is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan -- The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of a Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants
in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they could otherwise
purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received. However, there may not be enough shares
available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Funds do not redeem shares, the price on resale may
be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees -- There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Funds. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Funds purchase shares on the open market and shareholders will
pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications -- The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore, income and
capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not receive
cash. Participation in the Plan generally will not affect the tax-exempt status
of exempt interest dividends paid by the Funds. If, when the Funds' shares are
trading at a market premium, the Funds issue shares pursuant to the Plan that
have a greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is
possible that all or a portion of the discount from the market value (which may
not exceed 5% of the fair market value of the Funds' shares) could be viewed as
a taxable distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it
is also possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable
to all the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the
Plan. Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information -- All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The BNY Mellon

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (concluded)

For MA HEFA

The Fund offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in Common Shares of the Fund. The Fund declares dividends out of net
investment income, and will distribute annually net realized capital gains, if
any. Common Shareholders may join or withdraw from the Plan at any time.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, as
your Plan Agent, will automatically invest your dividends and capital gains
distributions in Common Shares of the Fund in your account.

Under the Plan, participants in the Plan will have their dividends reinvested in
Common Shares of the Fund on valuation date. If the market price per Common
Share on valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per Common Share on
that date, the Trust will issue new Common Shares to participants at the higher
of net asset value or 95% of the market price. If net asset value per Common
Share on valuation date exceeds the market price per Common Share on that date,
or if the Board should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable
to the Common Shareholders only in cash, the agent will buy Common Shares in the
open market on the American Stock Exchange, or elsewhere. If, before the Plan
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value
per Common Share, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent
may exceed the net asset value of the Trust's Common Shares, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer Common Shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in Common Shares by the Fund.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Common Shares in the account of each
Plan participant will be held by the Plan Agent in noncertificated form in the
name of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
received pursuant to the Plan. Holders of Common Shares who do not elect to
participate in the Plan will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check
mailed directly to the record shareholder by The Bank of New York, as dividend
paying agent.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.

The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Fund. Each participant will pay a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open
market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends or capital
gains distributions.

Plan participants will receive tax information annually for personal records and
to help prepare federal income tax returns. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve plan participants of
any income tax which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted below. If you withdraw, you will receive a share
certificate in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your account
under the Plan and a cash payment for any fraction of a share credited to your
account. If you desire, the Plan Agent will sell your shares in the Plan and
send you the proceeds of the sale, less brokerage commissions.

If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you should contact your nominee to see if it will participate in the Plan on
your behalf. If you wish to participate in the Plan, but your brokerage firm,
bank or nominee is unable to participate on your behalf, you should request that
your shares be re-registered in your own name, which will enable your
participation in the Plan.

Any correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8035,
Telephone: (866) 216-0242.

Additional Information

Dividend Policy

The Funds dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of their net
investment income to their shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Funds may
at times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in
any particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Funds for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Funds during such month. The Funds' current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities, which comprises part of the financial information included in this
report.

Fund Certification

BlackRock MuniHoldings Insured Investment Fund and BlackRock MuniHoldings New
York Insured Fund, Inc. are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") have filed with the NYSE their annual chief executive officer
certification regarding compliance with the NYSE's listing standards. Each Fund
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") the certification of
their chief executive officer and chief financial officer required by section
302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Availability of Quarterly Schedule of Investments

Each Fund files its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the
first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Funds' Forms N-Q
are available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and may also be
reviewed and copied at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC.
Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by
calling (800) SEC-0330. Each Fund's Forms N-Q may also be obtained upon request
and without charge by calling (800) 441-7762.

Electronic Delivery

Electronic copies of most financial reports are available on the Funds' websites
or shareholders can sign up for e-mail notifications of quarterly statements,
annual and semi-annual reports by enrolling in the Funds' electronic delivery
program.

Shareholders Who Hold Accounts with Investment Advisors, Banks or Brokerages:

Please contact your financial advisor to enroll. Please note that not all
investment advisors, banks or brokerages may offer this service.

General Information

The Funds do not make available copies of their Statements of Additional
Information because the Funds' shares are not continuously offered, which means
that the Statement of Additional Information of the Funds has not been updated
after completion of the Funds' offerings and the information contained in the
Funds' Statement of Additional Information may have become outdated.

During the period, there were no material changes in the Funds' investment
objectives or policies other than as disclosed in Note 7 of the Notes to
Financial Statements or to the Funds' charters or by-laws that were not approved
by the shareholders or in the principal risk factors associated with investment
in the Funds. There have been no changes in the persons who are primarily
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Funds' portfolio.

The Funds will mail only one copy of shareholder documents, including annual and
semi-annual reports and proxy statements, to shareholders with multiple accounts
at the same address. This practice is commonly called "householding" and it is
intended to reduce expenses and eliminate duplicate mailings of shareholder
documents. Mailings of your shareholder documents may be householded
indefinitely unless you instruct us otherwise. If you do not want the mailing of
these documents to be combined with those for other members of your household,
please contact the Funds at (800) 441-7762.

Quarterly performance, semi-annual and annual reports and other information
regarding the Funds may be found on BlackRock's website, which can be accessed
at http://www.blackrock.com. This reference to BlackRock's website is intended
to allow investors public access to information regarding the Funds and does
not, and is not intended to, incorporate BlackRock's website into this report.

Additional Information (concluded)

Certificate of Designation/Articles Supplementary/Certificate of Vote of
Trustees

Effective May 30, 2008, following approval by the Funds' Boards and the
applicable ratings agencies, the definition of "Deposit Securities" in each
Fund's Certificate of Designation/Articles Supplementary/Certificate of Vote of
Trustees was amended in order to facilitate the redemption of the Funds'
Preferred Shares. The following phrase was added to the definition of "Deposit
Securities" found in each Fund's Certificate of Designation/ Articles
Supplementary/Certificate of Vote of Trustees:

      ; provided, however, that solely in connection with any redemption of
      Preferred Shares, the term Deposit Securities shall include (i) any
      committed financing pursuant to a credit agreement, reverse repurchase
      agreement facility or similar credit arrangement, in each case which makes
      available to the Fund, no later than the day preceding the applicable
      redemption date, cash in an amount not less than the aggregate amount due
      to holders by reason of the redemption of their Preferred Shares on such
      redemption date; and (ii) cash amounts due and payable to the Fund out of
      a sale of its securities if such cash amount is not less than the
      aggregate amount due to holders by reason of the redemption of their
      shares of Preferred Shares on such redemption date and such sale will be
      settled not later than the day preceding the applicable redemption date.

Effective September 13, 2008, following approval by the Funds' Board and the
applicable rating agencies, the Board amended the terms of the Funds' Preferred
Shares in order to allow the Funds to enter into TOB transactions, the proceeds
of which were used to redeem a portion of the Funds' Preferred Shares.
Accordingly, the definition of Inverse Floaters was amended to incorporate the
Funds' permissible ratio of floating rate instruments into inverse floating rate
instruments. Additionally, conforming changes and certain formula modifications
concerning inverse floaters were made to the definitions of Moody's Discount
Factor and S&P Discount Factor, as applicable, to integrate the Fund's
investments in TOBs into applicable calculations.

performance results shown in this report should not be considered a

may affect the yield to Common Shareholders. Statements and other information

Item 2 -    Code of Ethics - The registrant (or the "Fund") has adopted a code
            of ethics, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
            applicable to the registrant's principal executive officer,
            principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, or
            persons performing similar functions. During the period covered by
            this report, there have been no amendments to or waivers granted
            under the code of ethics. A copy of the code of ethics is available
            without charge at www.blackrock.com.

Item 3 -    Audit Committee Financial Expert - The registrant's board of
            directors or trustees, as applicable (the "board of directors") has
            determined that (i) the registrant has the following audit committee
            financial experts serving on its audit committee and (ii) each audit
            committee financial expert is independent:
            Kent Dixon (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Frank J. Fabozzi (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            James T. Flynn (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Ronald W. Forbes (term ended effective November 1, 2007)
            W. Carl Kester (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Karen P. Robards (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Robert S. Salomon, Jr. (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Richard R. West (term ended effective November 1, 2007)

            The registrant's board of directors has determined that W. Carl
            Kester and Karen P. Robards qualify as financial experts pursuant to
            Item 3(c)(4) of Form N-CSR.

            Prof. Kester has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
            accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
            over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions. Prof.
            Kester has been involved in providing valuation and other financial
            consulting services to corporate clients since 1978. Prof. Kester's
            financial consulting services present a breadth and level of
            complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the
            breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to
            be raised by the registrant's financial statements.

            Ms. Robards has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
            accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
            over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions. Ms.
            Robards has been President of Robards & Company, a financial
            advisory firm, since 1987. Ms. Robards was formerly an investment
            banker for more than 10 years where she was responsible for
            evaluating and assessing the performance of companies based on their
            financial results. Ms. Robards has over 30 years of experience
            analyzing financial statements. She also is a member of the audit
            committee of one publicly held company and a non-profit
            organization.

            Under applicable securities laws, a person determined to be an audit
            committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any
            purpose, including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11
            of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or
            identified as an audit committee financial expert. The designation
            or identification as an audit committee financial expert does not
            impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liabilities
            greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on
            such person as a member of the audit committee and board of
            directors in the absence of such designation or identification.

      not included in Audit Fees.
2     The nature of the services include tax compliance, tax advice and tax
      planning.
3     The nature of the services include a review of compliance procedures and
      attestation thereto.

            (e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures:

                  The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
            policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
            Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
            registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
            Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
            provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to
            the registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly
            to the operations and the financial reporting of the registrant.
            Certain of these non-audit services that the Committee believes are
            a) consistent with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b)
            routine and recurring services that will not impair the independence
            of the independent accountants may be approved by the Committee
            without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis ("general
            pre-approval"). The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months
            from the date of the pre-approval, unless the Committee provides for
            a different period. Tax or other non-audit services provided to the
            registrant which have a direct impact on the operation or financial
            reporting of the registrant will only be deemed pre-approved
            provided that any individual project does not exceed $10,000
            attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for all of the registrants
            the Committee oversees. For this purpose, multiple projects will be
            aggregated to determine if they exceed the previously mentioned cost
            levels.

                  Any proposed services exceeding the pre-approved cost levels
            will require specific pre-approval by the Committee, as will any
            other services not subject to general pre-approval (e.g.,
            unanticipated but permissible services). The Committee is informed
            of each service approved subject to general pre-approval at the next
            regularly scheduled in-person board meeting. At this meeting, an
            analysis of such services is presented to the Committee for
            ratification. The Committee may delegate to one or more of its
            members the authority to approve the provision of and fees for any
            specific engagement of permitted non-audit services, including
            services exceeding pre-approved cost levels.

            (e)(2) None of the services described in each of Items 4(b) through
            (d) were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraph
            (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

            (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered and determined
            that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
            registrant's investment advisor (not including any non-affiliated
            sub-advisor whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
            subcontracted with or overseen by the registrant's investment
            advisor), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
            control with the investment advisor that provides ongoing services
            to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph
            (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
            maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

Item 6 -    Investments
            (a) The registrant's Schedule of Investments is included as part of
            the Report to Stockholders filed under Item 1 of this form.
            (b) Not Applicable due to no such divestments during the semi-annual
            period covered since the previous Form N-CSR filing.

Item 7 -    Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
            Management Investment Companies - The board of directors has
            delegated the voting of proxies for the Fund securities to the
            Fund's investment advisor ("Investment Advisor") pursuant to the
            Investment Advisor's proxy voting guidelines. Under these
            guidelines, the Investment Advisor will vote proxies related to Fund
            securities in the best interests of the Fund and its stockholders.
            From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the
            interests of the Fund's stockholders, on the one hand, and those of
            the Investment Advisor, or any affiliated person of the Fund or the
            Investment Advisor, on the other. In such event, provided that the
            Investment Advisor's Equity Investment Policy Oversight Committee,
            or a sub-committee thereof (the "Oversight Committee") is aware of
            the real or potential conflict or material non-routine matter and if
            the Oversight Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to
            follow its general voting guidelines (or if the particular proxy
            matter is not addressed in the guidelines) and vote impartially, the
            Oversight Committee may retain an independent fiduciary to advise
            the Oversight Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of
            the Investment Advisor's clients. If the Investment Advisor
            determines not to retain an independent fiduciary, or does not
            desire to follow the advice of such independent fiduciary, the
            Oversight Committee shall determine how to vote the proxy after
            consulting with the Investment Advisor's Portfolio Management Group
            and/or the Investment Advisor's Legal and Compliance Department and
            concluding that the vote cast is in its client's best interest
            notwithstanding the conflict. A copy of the Fund's Proxy Voting
            Policy and Procedures are attached as Exhibit 99.PROXYPOL.
            Information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio
            securities during the most recent 12-month period ended June 30 is

            (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest

<PAGE>

            BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, herein
            "BlackRock") has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
            compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
            protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
            another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address
            the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
            transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
            conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
            accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
            furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
            clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
            applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
            accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have
            performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio
            managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees),
            which may be the same as or different from those made for the Fund.
            In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and any officer, director,
            stockholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the
            securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Fund.
            BlackRock, or any of its affiliates, or any officer, director,
            stockholder, employee or any member of their families may take
            different actions than those recommended to the Fund by BlackRock
            with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain
            from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of
            companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
            directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
            which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors
            or employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest or
            possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager
            also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be
            opposed to the strategy utilized for a fund. In this regard, it
            should be noted that a portfolio manager may currently manage
            certain accounts that are subject to performance fees. In addition,
            a portfolio manager may assist in managing certain hedge funds and
            may be entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees earned on
            such funds and a portion of such incentive fees may be voluntarily
            or involuntarily deferred. Additional portfolio managers may in the
            future manage other such accounts or funds and may be entitled to
            receive incentive fees.

            As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
            must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
            securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated
            in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts
            to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
            accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
            end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
            investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
            client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve
            reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock
            with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that
            is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client
            base.

            (a)(3) As of August 31, 2008:

            Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview

            BlackRock's financial arrangements with its portfolio managers, its
            competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels
            reflect the value senior management places on key resources.
            Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from
            year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components
            of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based
            discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and
            one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by
            BlackRock such as its Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan.

<PAGE>

            Base compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base
            compensation based on their seniority and/or their position with the
            firm. Senior portfolio managers who perform additional management
            functions within the portfolio management group or within BlackRock
            may receive additional compensation for serving in these other
            capacities.

            Discretionary Incentive Compensation

            Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several
            components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of
            the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, the investment
            performance, including risk-adjusted returns, of the firm's assets
            under management or supervision by that portfolio manager relative
            to predetermined benchmarks, and the individual's seniority, role
            within the portfolio management team, teamwork and contribution to
            the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock. In most
            cases, including for the portfolio managers of the Fund, these
            benchmarks are the same as the benchmark or benchmarks against which
            the performance of the Fund or other accounts managed by the
            portfolio managers are measured. BlackRock's Chief Investment
            Officers determine the benchmarks against which the performance of
            funds and other accounts managed by each portfolio manager is
            compared and the period of time over which performance is evaluated.
            With respect to the portfolio managers, such benchmarks for the Fund
            include a combination of market-based indices (e.g. Lehman Brothers
            Municipal Bond Index), certain customized indices and certain fund
            industry peer groups.

            BlackRock's Chief Investment Officers make a subjective
            determination with respect to the portfolio managers' compensation
            based on the performance of the funds and other accounts managed by
            each portfolio manager relative to the various benchmarks noted
            above. Performance is measured on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis
            over various time periods including 1, 3, 5 and 10-year periods, as
            applicable.

            Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation

            Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio
            managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted
            stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. The
            BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units, if properly vested, will be
            settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Typically, the cash bonus,
            when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of total
            compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying a portion of annual
            bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for
            a given year "at risk" based on BlackRock's ability to sustain and
            improve its performance over future periods.

                  Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan ("LTIP") -- The LTIP is
            a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward certain key
            employees. Beginning in 2006, awards are granted under the LTIP in
            the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units that, if properly
            vested and subject to the attainment of certain performance goals,
            will be settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Messrs. Jaeckel and
            O'Connor have each received awards under the LTIP.

                  Deferred Compensation Program -- A portion of the compensation
            paid to eligible BlackRock employees may be voluntarily deferred
            into an account that tracks the performance of certain of the firm's
            investment products. Each participant in the deferred compensation
            program is permitted to allocate his deferred amounts among the
            various investment options. Each portfolio manager has participated
            in the deferred compensation program.

<PAGE>

            Other compensation benefits. In addition to base compensation and
            discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be
            eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:

                  Incentive Savings Plans -- BlackRock, Inc. has created a
            variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock employees are
            eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock
            Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), and the BlackRock Employee Stock
            Purchase Plan (ESPP). The employer contribution components of the
            RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 6% of eligible
            pay contributed to the plan capped at $4,000 per year, and a company
            retirement contribution equal to 3% of eligible compensation, plus
            an additional contribution of 2% for any year in which BlackRock has
            positive net operating income. The RSP offers a range of investment
            options, including registered investment companies managed by the
            firm. BlackRock contributions follow the investment direction set by
            participants for their own contributions or, absent employee
            investment direction, are invested into a balanced portfolio. The
            ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock common stock at a 5%
            discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date.
            Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to the purchase of 1,000
            shares or a dollar value of $25,000. Each portfolio manager is
            eligible to participate in these plans.

            (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of August 31, 2008,
                   neither of Messrs. Jaeckel or O'Connor beneficially owned any
                   stock issued by the Fund. As of August 31, 2008, Mr. Stuebe
                   beneficially owned stock issued by the Fund in the range
                   $50,001 - $100,000.

            Company and Affiliated Purchasers - Not Applicable due to no such
            purchases during the period covered by this report.

            registrant's Nominating and Governance Committee will consider

            information and set forth the qualifications of the proposed nominee
            to the registrant's Secretary. There have been no material changes
            to these procedures.

      The Trustees/Directors ("Directors") of the BlackRock-Advised Funds (the
"Funds") have the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio
securities of the Funds, and have determined that it is in the best interests of
the Funds and their shareholders to delegate that responsibility to BlackRock
Advisors, LLC and its affiliated U.S. registered investment advisers
("BlackRock"), the investment adviser to the Funds, as part of BlackRock's
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. The Directors hereby
direct BlackRock to vote such proxies in accordance with this Policy, and any
proxy voting guidelines that the Adviser determines are appropriate and in the
best interests of the Funds' shareholders and which are consistent with the
principles outlined in this Policy. The Directors have authorized BlackRock to
utilize an unaffiliated third-party as its agent to vote portfolio proxies in
accordance with this Policy and to maintain records of such portfolio proxy
voting.

      When BlackRock votes proxies for an advisory client that has delegated to
BlackRock proxy voting authority, BlackRock acts as the client's agent. Under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"), an investment adviser
is a fiduciary that owes each of its clients a duty of care and loyalty with
respect to all services the adviser undertakes on the client's behalf, including
proxy voting. BlackRock is therefore subject to a fiduciary duty to vote proxies
in a manner BlackRock believes is consistent with the client's best
interests.(1) When voting proxies for the Funds, BlackRock's primary objective
is to make voting decisions solely in the best interests of the Funds'
shareholders. In fulfilling its obligations to shareholders, BlackRock will seek
to act in a manner that it believes is most likely to enhance the economic value
of the underlying securities held in client accounts.(2) It is imperative that
BlackRock considers the interests of Fund shareholders, and not the interests of
BlackRock, when voting proxies and that real (or perceived) material conflicts
that may arise between BlackRock's interest and those of BlackRock's clients are
properly addressed and resolved.

      Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-6 was adopted by the SEC in 2003 and requires,
among other things, that an investment adviser that exercises voting authority
over clients' proxy voting adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients,
discloses to its clients information about those policies and procedures and
also discloses to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has
voted their proxies.

(1) Letter from Harvey L. Pitt, Chairman, SEC, to John P.M. Higgins, President,
Ram Trust Services (February 12, 2002) (Section 206 of the Investment Advisers
Act imposes a fiduciary responsibility to vote proxies fairly and in the best
interests of clients); SEC Release No. IA-2106 (February 3, 2003).

(2) Other considerations, such as social, labor, environmental or other
policies, may be of interest to particular clients. While BlackRock is cognizant
of the importance of such considerations, when voting proxies it will generally
take such matters into account only to the extent that they have a direct
bearing on the economic value of the underlying securities. To the extent that a
BlackRock client, such as the Funds, desires to pursue a particular social,
labor, environmental or other agenda through the proxy votes made for its
securities held through BlackRock as investment adviser, BlackRock encourages
the client to consider retaining direct proxy voting authority or to appoint
independently a special proxy voting fiduciary other than BlackRock.

      BlackRock has adopted separate but substantially similar guidelines and
procedures that are consistent with the principles of this Policy. BlackRock's
Equity Investment Policy Oversight Committee, or a sub-committee thereof (the
"Committee"), addresses proxy voting issues on behalf of BlackRock and its
clients, including the Funds. The Committee is comprised of senior members of
BlackRock's Portfolio Management and Administration Groups and is advised by
BlackRock's Legal and Compliance Department.

                              Proxy Voting Policies

      A. Boards of Directors

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders relating to
the composition of the board of directors of companies other than investment
companies. As a general matter, the Funds believe that a company's board of
directors (rather than shareholders) is most likely to have access to important,
nonpublic information regarding a company's business and prospects, and is
therefore best-positioned to set corporate policy and oversee management. The
Funds therefore believe that the foundation of good corporate governance is the
election of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to
diligently represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over time.
In individual cases, consideration may be given to a director nominee's history
of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies, or other
factors to the extent deemed relevant by the Committee.

      B. Auditors

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders related to
the selection of auditors. As a general matter, the Funds believe that corporate
auditors have a responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and
provide an independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
corporate management. While the Funds anticipate that the Committee will
generally defer to a corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases,
consideration may be given to an auditors' history of representing shareholder
interests as auditor of other companies, to the extent deemed relevant.

      C. Compensation and Benefits

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders related to
management compensation and employee benefits. As a general matter, the Funds
favor disclosure of a company's compensation and benefit policies and oppose
excessive compensation, but believe that compensation matters are normally best
determined by a corporation's board of directors, rather than shareholders.
Proposals to "micro-manage" a company's compensation practices or to set
arbitrary restrictions on compensation or benefits should therefore generally
not be supported by the Committee.

      D. Capital Structure

      These proposals relate to various requests, principally from management,
for approval of amendments that would alter the capital structure of a company,
such as an increase in authorized shares. As a general matter, the Funds expect
that the Committee will support requests that it believes enhance the rights of
common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably dilutive.

      E. Corporate Charter and By-Laws

      These proposals relate to various requests for approval of amendments to a
corporation's charter or by-laws, principally for the purpose of adopting or
redeeming "poison pills". As a general matter, the Funds expect that the
Committee will oppose poison pill provisions unless, after consultation with the
portfolio managers, it is determined that supporting the poison pill is in the
best interest of shareholders.

      F. Corporate Meetings

      These are routine proposals relating to various requests regarding the
formalities of corporate meetings. As a general matter, the Funds expect that
the Committee will support company management except where the proposals are
substantially duplicative or serve no legitimate business purpose.

      G. Investment Companies

      These proposals relate to proxy issues that are associated solely with
holdings of shares of investment companies, including, but not limited to,
investment companies for which BlackRock provides investment advisory,
administrative and/or other services. As with other types of companies, the
Funds believe that an investment company's board of directors (rather than its
shareholders) is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management.
However, the Funds oppose granting boards of directors authority over certain
matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the Investment
Company Act of 1940 envisions will be approved directly by shareholders.

      H. Environmental and Social Issues

      These are shareholder proposals to limit corporate conduct in some manner
that relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The Funds
generally believe that annual shareholder meetings are inappropriate forums for
the discussion of larger social issues, and oppose shareholder resolutions
"micro-managing" corporate conduct or requesting release of information that
would not help a shareholder evaluate an investment in the corporation as an


                                      - 3 -

economic matter. While the Funds are generally supportive of proposals to
require corporate disclosure of matters that seem relevant and material to the
economic interests of shareholders, the Funds generally are not supportive of
proposals to require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

                              Reports to the Board

BlackRock will report to the Directors on proxy votes it has made on behalf of
the Funds at least annually.
