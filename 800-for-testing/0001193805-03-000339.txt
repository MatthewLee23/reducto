The Benefits and
Risks of
Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leverage through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the return earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its market price. If the income
derived from securities purchased with assets received from leverage exceeds the
cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater than if leverage had not
been used. Conversely, if the income from the securities purchased is not
sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be less
than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the amount available for
distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced. In this case, the
Fund may nevertheless decide to maintain its leveraged position in order to
avoid capital losses on securities purchased with leverage. However, the Fund
will not generally utilize leverage if it anticipates that its leveraged capital
structure would result in a lower rate of return for its Common Stock than would
be obtained if the Common Stock were unleveraged for any significant amount of
time.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER

Investment Approach

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. is comprised of high yield bonds and leveraged bank
loans. The high yield bond and bank loan markets contain similar industry
sectors and often have overlapping issuers. As a result, general economic events
and trends tend to move the two markets in the same direction, although bonds
typically experience greater volatility than bank loans. This can be attributed
to two factors. First, bank loans are usually senior secured obligations, thus
generally offering investors greater principal protection than unsecured bonds.
Second, bank loans are typically floating rate instruments whose principal value
generally does not move inversely with interest rate movements, as is the case
with fixed income bonds.

Market Review

The continued high and unprecedented level of default rates in 2002 was the
dominant factor impacting the high yield markets. Although the default rate for
junk bond-rated companies fell from 10.6% to 8.3%, the actual dollar volume of
defaults increased. Moody's Investors Service is forecasting a decline in the
default rate to 6.9% for 2003.

The high yield bond and leveraged loan markets' returns both crossed into
negative territory in the second and third quarters, but this situation reversed
sharply in the fourth quarter because of the emergence of solid retail and
institutional demand in mid-October. Both markets had positive performance
results for the fourth quarter of 2002 with +5.92% (bonds) and +1.93% (bank
loans), as measured by their respective Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB)
Indexes.

An important development in the high yield markets occurred in 2002 as we saw
the importance of collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) abate significantly.
The channel for collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) remains open, though
somewhat constricted. The negative impact of high yield bond defaults on the
subordinated investor tranches is the principal reason for the decline of CBO
issues. With non-CBO investor demand channels currently playing a relatively
more important role in the high yield markets, this may increase volatility as
CBOs have a comparatively more stable and longer-term investment horizon than
retail funds.

Fund Performance

For the year ended February 28, 2003, the Common Stock of Debt Strategies Fund,
Inc. had a net annualized yield of 14.61%, based on a year-end per share net
asset value of $5.35 and $.782 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +2.04%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $6.03 to $5.35, and assuming
reinvestment of $.789 per share ordinary income dividends. For the six-month
period ended February 28, 2003, the total investment return on the Fund's Common
Stock was +11.88%, based on a change in per share net asset value from $5.14 to
$5.35, and assuming reinvestment of $.393 per share income dividends. For the
one-year and six-month periods ended February 28, 2003, the Fund's benchmark,
which is an equal blend of the CSFB High Yield Index and the CSFB Leveraged Loan
Index, had total returns of +5.05% and +6.55%, respectively.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value (as measured by the trading price of the Fund's shares on
the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming reinvestment of dividends, please
refer to the Financial Highlights section of the Financial Statements included
in this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the
secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a
result, total investment returns based on changes in the Fund's market value can
vary significantly from total investment return based on changes in the Fund's
net asset value.

There are both general and specific reasons for this performance. First, as we
stated in previous shareholder reports, we maintained an overweighted position
in bonds relative to bank loans in order to maintain the dividend yield and
benefit from a potential rally in the high yield market. The Fund underperformed
in the first half of the fiscal year, and outperformed in the second half, as
the overweighted bond position caused the Fund to move in greater sympathy with
the high yield bond market. Second, there were several specific investments that
hurt performance during the year. Among them was Mission Energy Holdings, where
we saw our $30 million bond position collapse in price from 101 to 28. Mission
Energy is a holding company founded to own Edison International of California,
which in turn bought the non-nuclear generating assets of Exelon Corporation
(formerly Commonwealth Edison). Mission Energy was pressured by two factors.
First, the decision by a major customer not to renew a long-term power purchase
agreement, left Mission Energy more exposed to the vagaries of the spot market.
Second, the downgrading of Edison to below investment grade inhibited its
ability to upstream dividends to Mission Energy. Importantly, a combination of
escrowed coupons and tax sharing arrangements would give the company sufficient
debt service ability through 2004 and time to resolve these problems.
Considering that the price of 28 at February 28, 2003 values these securities
only slightly above the value of these payments, we believe these bonds are
quite undervalued.

Our bank loan and bond exposure in the cable television company Charter
Communications Holdings LLC also hurt Fund performance. Our $11 million in bank
loan positions weakened from 97 to 84, while $19.7 million in various bond
holdings fell in price from the high 90s into the 40s. These positions began to
weaken following the Adelphia Communications Corp. bankruptcy. This situation
was further exacerbated by disclosure that Charter Communication's management
had concealed the true level of subscriber disconnects. This issue has been
addressed and relevant management replaced. Charter Communications is currently
in compliance with its debt agreements but remains relatively highly leveraged.
Nevertheless, we believe our positions are currently undervalued.

Positive developments in the Fund included our holdings in Nextel
Communications, Inc. Our confidence in this wireless provider was rewarded as we
sold $23 million in bonds and bank debt around 80 and purchased 16,000 shares of
Preferred Stock around 60. We subsequently liquidated most of the preferred
position at prices ranging from 94 to par. Our 7,300 remaining shares at
February 28, 2003 were trading above par. Radio Unica Corp. was another positive
holding for the Fund as our $24 million bond position rallied from 41 to 60
during the year. This company is the only national Spanish language radio
network in the United States. Paradoxically, the bond price strengthened on the
prospect of the company missing its coupon payment (which was subsequently made
during the 30-day grace period), highlighting the firm's excellent franchise
value, and ample asset coverage.

Investment Strategy

With the three-month London InterBank Offering Rate near 1.3%, we plan to
continue our high yield bond overweight at around 70% of total assets. We are
maintaining leverage near 33%, and managing the duration of the bond portion of
the Fund's portfolio approximately 3.1 years, compared to a high yield market
duration of 4.0 years. By doing so, we are seeking to lessen the potential
negative impact on high yield bond prices should a rising interest rate outlook
prompt a rebalancing toward bank loans.

In Conclusion

The market is currently dominated by geopolitical risk. We are managing the Fund
somewhat defensively (that is, through shorter duration and broad
diversification), while maintaining the portfolio's yield in this low interest
rate environment. However, we are confident that we will continue to see
well-structured transactions and a declining default rate through 2003.

We thank you for your interest in Debt Strategies Fund, Inc., and we look
forward to serving your investment needs in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The following description of the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required by the Federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock otherwise elects,
all dividend and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested by
The Bank of New York, as agent for shareholders in administering the Plan (the
"Plan Agent"), in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. Holders of
Common Stock who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive all
distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of record
(or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name then to such
nominee) by The Bank of New York, as dividend paying agent. Such participants
may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive all distributions of
dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to The Bank
of New York, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by written notice if received by the Plan
Agent not less than ten days prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
termination will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend
or distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares an income dividend or capital gains distribution
(collectively referred to as "dividends") payable either in shares or in cash,
non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be acquired by
the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon the circumstances
described below, either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of Common Stock from the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii)
by purchase of outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market
("open-market purchases") on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If on the
payment date for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the Common Stock
is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common Stock plus
estimated brokerage commissions (such condition being referred to herein as
"market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly
issued shares on behalf of the participant. The number of newly issued shares of
Common Stock to be credited to the participant's account will be determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
current market price per share on the date of issuance may not exceed 5%. If on
the dividend payment date the net asset value per share is greater than the
market value (such condition being referred to herein as "market discount"), the
Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the
participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the Plan Agent
will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no event more than 30 days after the
dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest the dividend amount
in shares acquired in open-market purchases. It is contemplated that the Fund
will pay monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which
open-market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date on the
dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date which typically
will be approximately ten days. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
open-market purchases, the market price of a share of Common Stock exceeds the
net asset value per share, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan
Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in newly issued
shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to open-market purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is
unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the
purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market purchases and will
invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at
the close of business on the last purchase date determined by dividing the
uninvested portion of the dividend by the net asset value per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all
proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees that hold shares
of others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan
on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the record
shareholders as representing the total amount registered in the record
shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the
Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains distributions payable either in
shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any Federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not available to
shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the market price plus commissions
of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants in the Plan will
receive shares of the Fund at less than they could otherwise purchase them and
will have shares with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market price plus
commissions is below the net asset value, participants will receive
distributions in shares with a net asset value greater than the value of any
cash distribution they would have received on their shares. However, there may
be insufficient shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be excluded
from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would be
excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a premium
over net asset value, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a
greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible
that all or a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the fair
market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable distribution. If
the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also possible that the
taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all the shareholders,
including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders
who do not participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary
income a portion of their distributions equal to their allocable share of the
discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right
to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
The Bank of New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY
10286-1258, Telephone: 800-432-8224.

*     Not Rated.
**    Floating rate corporate debt in which the Fund invests generally pays
      interest at rates that are periodically redetermined by reference to a
      base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally
      (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European banks, such as
      LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate), (ii) the prime rate offered by one
      or more major United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit
      rate. Floating rate corporate debt is generally considered to be
      restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is contractually obligated to
      receive approval from the agent bank and/or borrower prior to its
      disposition. Corporate loans represent 36.3% of the Fund's net assets.
+     Non-income producing security.
++    Ratings of issues shown are unaudited.
(a)   Floating rate note.
(b)   Represents a pay-in-kind security which may pay interest/dividends in
      additional face/shares.
(c)   Represents a zero coupon or step bond; the interest rate on a step bond
      will commence its accrual at a fixed rate of interest on a predetermined
      date until maturity.
(d)   The security may be offered and sold to "qualified institutional buyers"
      under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.
(e)   Each Equity Right entitles the Fund to purchase one share of new Preferred
      Stock at a price of $10.80 per Equity Right.
(f)   Mortgage-Backed Obligations are subject to principal paydowns as a result
      of prepayments or refinancing of the underlying mortgage instruments. As a
      result, the average life may be substantially less than the original
      maturity.
(g)   Warrants entitle the Fund to purchase a predetermined number of shares of
      common stock and are non-income producing. The purchase price and number
      of shares are subject to adjustment under certain conditions until the
      expiration date.
(h)   Maturity of this security is pending as a result of bankruptcy
      proceedings.
(i)   Investments in companies considered to be an affiliate of the Fund (such
      companies are defined as "Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the
      Investment Company Act of 1940) are as follows:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.
The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which may require
the use of management accruals and estimates. The Fund determines and makes
available for publication the net asset value of its Common Stock on a weekly
basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including Corporate Loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks, the
Fund's investment in Corporate Loans could be considered concentrated in
financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Corporate Loans are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Corporate Loans are valued at
the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more
brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the limited
number of Corporate Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
Corporate Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
pricing matrices to determine valuations. If the pricing service does not
provide a value for the Corporate Loan, the Investment Adviser will value the
loan at fair value, which is intended to approximate market value.

Other portfolio securities may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one
or more pricing services, which determine prices for normal, institutional-size
trading units of such securities using market information, transactions for
comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are
generally recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances,
portfolio securities are valued at the last sale price on the exchange that is
the primary market for such securities, or the last quoted bid price for those
securities for which the over-the-counter market is the primary market or for
listed securities in which there were no sales during the day. The value of
interest rate swaps, caps and floors is determined in accordance with a formula
and then confirmed periodically by obtaining a bank quotation. Financial futures
contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at
their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or
purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded
options. In the case of options traded in the over-the-counter market, valuation
is the last asked price (options written) or the last bid price (options
purchased). Short-term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Securities
and assets for which market price quotations are not readily available are
valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of
the Board of Directors of the Fund. Occasionally, events affecting the values of
securities and other assets may occur between the times at which valuations of
such securities are determined (that is, close of the market on which such
security trades) and the close of business on the NYSE. If events (for example,
company announcement, natural disasters, market volatility) occur during such
periods that are expected to materially affect the value for such securities,
those securities may be valued at their fair market value as determined in good
faith by the Fund's Board of Directors or by the investment adviser using a
pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Board of Directors of the
Fund.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies to increase or decrease the level of risk to which the
Fund is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of
instruments. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if
the counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial futures
contracts and options on such futures contracts for the purpose of hedging the
market risk on existing securities or for the intended purchase of securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific
future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the
Fund deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by the
exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the
Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the
daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and
the value at the time it was closed.

o Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund is authorized to enter into
forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific
transactions or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and
the change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss
equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened and the
value at the time it was closed.

o Options -- The Fund is authorized to write covered call and put options and
purchase call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal
to the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent
liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked to market to
reflect the current market value of the option written. When a security is
purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the related premium paid (or
received) is added to (or deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or
deducted from (or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option
expires (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a
gain or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or
gain or loss to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the
premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o Interest rate swaps -- The Fund is authorized to enter into swap agreements
for the purpose of hedging the market risk on existing securities. In a swap
agreement, the Fund exchanges with the counterparty their respective commitments
to pay or receive interest on a specified notional principal amount. If the
counterparty defaults on its obligation, the Fund's ability to receive interest
will be delayed or limited. Furthermore, if the Fund does not have sufficient
income to pay its obligation under the swap agreement, the Fund would be in
default and the counterparty would be able to terminate the swap agreement. When
the swap agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the swap agreement at the time it was
entered into and the value at the time it was closed.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(h) Offering expenses -- During the year ended February 28, 2002, overestimated
offering expenses resulting from the issuance of Common Stock were written off
to paid-in capital in excess of par.

(i) Reclassification -- Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America require that certain components of net assets be adjusted to
reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly,
the current year's permanent book/tax difference of $391,518 have been
reclassified between accumulated net realized capital losses and undistributed
net investment income. This reclassification has no effect on net assets or net
asset value per share.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner. FAM has entered into a Sub-Advisory
Agreement with Merrill Lynch Asset Management U.K. Limited ("MLAM U.K."), an
affiliate of FAM, pursuant to which MLAM U.K. provides investment advisory
services to FAM with respect to the Fund. There is no increase in the aggregate
fees paid by the Fund for these services.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

For the year ended February 28, 2003, the Fund paid Merrill Lynch Security
Pricing Service, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated ("MLPF&S"), $553 for security price quotations to compute the net
asset value of the Fund.

In addition, MLPF&S received $11,169 in commissions on the execution of
portfolio security transactions for the Fund for the year ended February 28,
2003.

For the year ended February 28, 2003, the Fund reimbursed FAM $14,049 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, MLAM U.K., PSI, and/or ML & Co.

issuance of commercial paper notes by certain Lenders at rates of interest
derived from the weighted average of the per annum rates paid or payable by such

*     On February 28, 2003, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $288,233,985, of which $263,491 expires in 2005, $12,067,388 expires in
      2006, $27,376,921 expires in 2007, $51,234,056 expires in 2008,
      $21,442,332 expires in 2009, $90,564,493 expires in 2010 and $85,285,304
      expires in 2011. This amount will be available to offset like amounts of
      any future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized losses is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      book/tax differences in the accrual of income on securities in default,
      the difference between book and tax amortization methods for premiums and
      discounts on fixed income securities, the deferral of post-October capital
      losses for tax purposes and other book/tax temporary differences.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Shareholders,
Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and capital,
including the schedule of investments, of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. as of
February 28, 2003, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the respective periods then ended. These financial statements and the
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and the financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned at February 28, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and
financial intermediaries; where replies were not received from financial
intermediaries, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Debt Strategies
Fund, Inc. as of February 28, 2003, the results of its operations and its cash
flows, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the
respective stated periods in conformity with accounting principles generally
