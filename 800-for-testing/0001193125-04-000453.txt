LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

[PHOTO]

R. Jay Gerken
R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

I am gratified to report that the Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc.
performed well during the six months ended October 31, 2003, based on both its
market price return of 13.16% and its net asset value ("NAV")/i/ return of
12.81%, the fund outperformed the unmanaged Citigroup High-Yield Market
Index,/ii/ which returned 8.84% for the same period. In comparison, the fund's
Lipper peer group of high current yield (leveraged) closed-end funds generated
an average return of 13.16% over the six months./iii/ Please note that Lipper
peer group performance is based on each fund's NAV.

During the six months, the fund distributed dividends to shareholders totaling
$0.69 per share. The table below shows the six-month total return based on the
fund's October 31, 2003 NAV per share and its New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
closing price. Past performance is not indicative of future results.


                    FUND PERFORMANCE AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2003

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                   Six-Month
                    Total
 Price Per Share   Return
<S>               <C>
- ----------------  ---------
  $11.02 (NAV)       12.81%
- ----------------  ---------
 $12.40 (NYSE)       13.16%
</TABLE>

  Total returns are based on changes in NAV or the market price, respectively.
  Total return assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
  distributions in additional shares.


The market rally in U.S. high-yield and emerging market debt securities early
in the period came to a halt over the summer, as the sharp rise in U.S.
Treasury bond yields exerted pressure on bond markets. However, declining
default rates and an improved corporate earnings environment led the market to
advance again through the end of October. The U.S. high-yield corporate bond
market is typically more closely linked to the strength of corporate balance
sheets than to interest rates. Performance was also driven, in part, by an
improvement in fundamentals within specific emerging market countries -
particularly the strong returns in Latin America - as well as by an increase in
investors' appetite for higher-yielding international investment alternatives.

Factors Influencing Fund Performance

During the six months, in terms of its U.S. bond holdings, the fund benefited
from its overweighting in the aerospace, cable/media, and communications towers
sectors and by its underweighting in the leisure, metals/mining, paper/forest
products, and restaurant sectors. The fund was adversely affected by its
underweighting in bonds rated CCC and in the airlines sector and by its
overweighting in the chemicals sector. The fund increased its exposure to
issues with CCC credit ratings and added to its positions in the cable/media,
communications towers, and energy sectors, while reducing its holdings in the
metals/mining, paper/forest products, and technology sectors during the period.

Within the fund's emerging markets debt component, the fund's performance was
positively impacted by its overweighted exposure to Brazilian and Ecuadorian
debt. The fund's performance was also positively impacted by the use of
leverage./iv/ The fund's underweighted position in Venezuelan and Turkish debt
detracted from its relative performance during the period.

Especially in this environment of four-decade-low money market yields,
higher-yielding bonds in U.S. and emerging markets may seem appealing.
Remember, however, that higher-yield bonds carry more credit risk than
investment-grade issues, and international issues are subject to economic,
political and currency risks. These additional risks are reasons why it is
critical to perform a thorough analysis before carefully choosing these bonds.
In our opinion, this is all the more reason why investing in high-yield bonds
with a professional fund manager is a more prudent strategy than buying these
bonds directly. Fund managers can provide the diversification and thorough
credit analysis that is an important part of managing risk.

Looking for Additional Information?

The fund is traded under the symbol "HIX" and its closing market price is
available in most newspapers under the New York Stock Exchange listings. The
daily NAV is available online under symbol XHIXX. Barron's and The Wall Street
Journal's Monday editions carry closed-end fund tables that will provide
additional information. In addition, the fund issues a quarterly allocation
press release that can be found on most major financial web sites.

In a continuing effort to provide information concerning the fund, shareholders
may call 1-888-777-0102 or 1-800-SALOMON (toll free), Monday through Friday
from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), for the fund's current NAV,
market price and other information regarding the fund's portfolio holdings and
allocations.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of October 31, 2003 and are subject to
change. Please refer to pages 4 through 16 for a list and percentage breakdown
of the fund's holdings.

/i/  NAV is a price that reflects the value of the fund's underlying portfolio
     plus other assets, less the fund's liabilities. However, the price at which
     an investor may buy or sell shares of the fund is at the fund's market
     price as determined by supply of and demand for the fund's shares.
/ii/ The Citigroup High-Yield Market Index is a broad-based unmanaged index of
     high-yield securities. Please note that an investor cannot invest directly
     in an index.
/iii/Lipper Inc. is a major independent mutual-fund tracking organization.
     Average returns are based on the six-month period ended October 31, 2003,
     calculated among 26 funds in the fund's Lipper peer group including the
     reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
/iv/ Leverage will magnify gains and disproportionately increase losses in the
     fund's portfolio.

SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc. ("Fund") was incorporated in Maryland
and is registered as a diversified, closed-end, management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Fund seeks to
maximize current income by investing at least 80% of its net assets plus any
borrowings for investment purposes in high yield debt securities (as defined in
the Fund's prospectus). As a secondary objective, the Fund seeks capital
appreciation to the extent consistent with its objective of seeking to maximize
current income.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimates.

(a) SECURITIES VALUATION. In valuing the Fund's assets, all securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued (i) at the last sale
price prior to the time of determination if there were a sale on the date of
determination, (ii) at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices
if there were no sales on such date and bid and asked quotations are available,
and (iii) at the bid price if there were no sales price on such date and only
bid quotations are available. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the last current bid and asked price as of
the close of business of that market. However, when the spread between bid and
asked price exceeds five percent of the par value of the security, the security
is valued at the bid price. Securities may also be valued by independent
pricing services which use prices provided by market-makers or estimates of
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities
with similar characteristics. Short-term investments having a maturity of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.
Securities for which reliable quotations are not readily available and all
other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade
date. Interest income is accrued on a daily basis. Market discount or premium
on securities purchased is accreted or amortized, respectively, on an effective
yield basis over the life of the security. The Fund uses the specific
identification method for determining realized gain or loss on investments.
Dividend income is recorded on ex-dividend date.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Fund has complied and intends to continue to
comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)

investment companies, and to distribute all of its income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax or excise tax provision is required.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund declares and pays dividends to
shareholders monthly from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, in
excess of loss carryovers are expected to be distributed at least annually.
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the components of net
assets.

(e) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the
Fund's policy to take possession, through the custodian, of the underlying
collateral and to monitor its value at the time the arrangement is entered into
and during the term of the repurchase agreement to ensure that it equals or
exceeds the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligation to
repurchase, the Fund has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the
proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the
event of default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization
and/or retention of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

(f) CASH FLOW INFORMATION. The Fund invests in securities and distributes
dividends from net investment income and net realized gains which are paid in
cash and may be reinvested at the discretion of shareholders. These activities
are reported in the statement of changes in net assets and additional
information on cash receipts and cash payments is presented in the statement of
cash flows.

(g) YEAR END TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. The character of income and gains to be
distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from GAAP.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc ("Investment Manager"), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment
manager to the Fund. The Investment Manager is responsible on a day-to-day
basis for the management of the Fund's portfolio in accordance with the Fund's
investment objectives and policies and for making decisions to buy, sell or
hold particular securities of the Fund. The management fee for these services
is payable monthly at an annual rate of 1.00% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("Administrator"), another indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, acts as the Fund's administrator for
which the Fund pays a monthly fee

                                                                        Page 23

SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)

at an annual rate of 0.10% of the value of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage. The
administrator performs certain administrative services necessary for the
operation of the Fund.

During periods in which the Fund is utilizing financial leverage, the fees
which are payable to the Investment Manager and Administrator as a percentage
of the Fund's assets will be higher than if the Fund did not utilize leverage
because the fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund's assets, including
those investments purchased with leverage.

At October 31, 2003, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), another indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, held 11.766 shares of the Fund.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are also officers and/or
directors of the Investment Manager.

NOTE 3. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

During the six months ended October 31, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases
and proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

<TABLE>
           <S>                                           <C>

At October 31, 2003, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation of investments for Federal income tax purposes were substantially
as follows:

          Gross unrealized depreciation................  (59,590,223)
                                                        ------------
          Net unrealized appreciation.................. $ 54,481,786
                                                        ============
</TABLE>

NOTE 4. LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian whereby the custodian may lend
securities owned by the Fund to brokers, dealers and other financial
organizations. Fees earned by the Fund on securities lending are recorded in
interest income. Loans of securities by the Fund are collateralized by cash,
U.S. government securities or high quality money market instruments that are
maintained at all times in an amount at least equal to the current market value
of the securities loaned, plus a margin which may vary depending on the type of
securities loaned. The Fund maintains exposure for the risk of any losses in
the investment of amounts received as collateral.

Page 24

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)


At October 31, 2003, the Fund loaned securities having a market value of
$141,644,174. The Fund received cash collateral amounting to $143,998,957 which
was invested into the State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust Prime
Portfolio.

Income earned by the Fund from securities lending for the six months ended
October 31, 2003 was $121,443.

NOTE 5. LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

The Fund invests in fixed and floating rate loans arranged through private
negotiations between a foreign sovereign entity and one or more financial
institutions. The Fund's investment in any such loan may be in the form of a
participation in or an assignment of the loan.

In connection with purchasing participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan
agreement relating to the loan, nor any rights of set-off against the borrower,
and the Fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan
in which it has purchased the participation. As a result, the Fund will assume
the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender that is selling the
participation. In the event of the insolvency of the lender selling the
participation, the Fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and
may not benefit from any set-off between the lender and the borrower.

At October 31, 2003, the Fund held loan participations with a total cost of
$5,480,831.

NOTE 6. CREDIT RISK

The yields of emerging markets debt obligations and high-yield corporate debt
obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's
investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks
not associated with higher rated securities including, among others, overall
greater risk of timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater
market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading. The
consequences of political, social, economic or diplomatic changes may have
disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the Fund.

NOTE 7. LOAN

At October 31, 2003, the Fund had outstanding a $300,000,000 loan pursuant to a
revolving credit and security agreement with CXC Inc., an affiliate of
Citigroup, a commercial paper conduit issuer for which Citicorp North America
Inc., an affiliate of the Investment Manager, acts as administrative agent. The
loans generally bear interest at a variable rate based on the weighted average
interest rates of the underlying commercial paper or LIBOR, plus any applicable
margin. Securities held by the Fund are subject to a lien, granted to the
lenders, to the extent of the borrowing outstanding and any additional
expenses. For the six months ended October 31, 2003, the Fund paid interest
expense of $2,551,488.

                                                                        Page 25

NOTE 8. DIVIDENDS SUBSEQUENT TO OCTOBER 31, 2003

On July 18, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Fund declared dividends in the
amount of $0.115 per share, payable on November 28, 2003 to shareholders of
record on November 18, 2003.

On October 22, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Fund declared three
dividends, each in the amount of $0.115 per share, payable on December 26,
2003, January 30, 2004, and February 27, 2004 to shareholders of record on
December 16, 2003, January 13, 2004 and February 18, 2004, respectively.

NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue
guarantee agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor
would guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue
Guarantee Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the
sub-contractor's business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent
(PFPC Inc.) used by CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee
Agreement was amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements
that included a one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards informed of
the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when that occurred.

CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
$16 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received from the
Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. CAM also plans an independent
review to verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were fairly
priced as compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new
procedures and making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are
entered into in the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Pursuant to certain rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission the
following additional disclosure is provided.

Each shareholder purchasing shares of common stock ("Shares") of Salomon
Brothers High Income Fund II Inc. ("Fund") will be deemed to have elected to be
a participant in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), unless the
shareholder specifically elects in writing (addressed to the Agent at the
address below or to any nominee who holds Shares for the shareholder in its
name) to receive all income dividends and distributions of capital gains in
cash, paid by check, mailed directly to the record holder by or under the
direction of PFPC Inc. as the Fund's dividend-paying agent ("Agent"). A
shareholder whose Shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee who does
not provide an automatic reinvestment service may be required to take such
Shares out of "street name" and register such Shares in the shareholder's name
in order to participate, otherwise dividends and distributions will be paid in
cash to such shareholder by the broker or nominee. Each participant in the Plan
is referred to herein as a "Participant." The Agent will act as Agent for each
Participant, and will open accounts for each Participant under the Plan in the
same name as their Shares are registered.

Unless the Fund declares a dividend or distribution payable only in the form of
cash, the Agent will apply all dividends and distributions in the manner set
forth below.

If, on the determination date (as defined below), the market price per Share
equals or exceeds the net asset value per Share on that date (such condition, a
"market premium"), the Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in newly
issued Shares of the Fund on behalf of Participants. If, on the determination
date, the net asset value per Share exceeds the market price per Share (such
condition, a "market discount"), the Agent will purchase Shares in the open
market. The determination date will be the fourth New York Stock Exchange
trading day (a New York Stock Exchange trading day being referred to herein as
a "Trading Day") preceding the payment date for the dividend or distribution.
For purposes herein, "market price" will mean the average of the highest and
lowest prices at which the Shares sell on the New York Stock Exchange on the
particular date, or if there is no sale on that date, the average of the
closing bid and asked quotations.

Purchases made by the Agent will be made as soon as practicable commencing on
the Trading Day following the determination date and terminating no later than
30 days after the dividend or distribution payment date except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities law; provided, however, that such purchases
will, in any event, terminate on the Trading Day prior to the "ex-dividend"
date next succeeding the dividend or distribution payment date.

If (i) the Agent has not invested the full dividend amount in open market
purchases by the date specified at the bottom of the prior page as the date on
which such purchases must terminate or (ii) a market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, then the

                                                                        Page 29

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.



DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

Agent will cease making open market purchases and will receive the uninvested
portion of the dividend amount in newly issued Shares (x) in the case of (i)
above, at the close of business on the date the Agent is required to terminate
making open market purchases as specified at the bottom of the prior page or
(y) in the case of (ii) above, at the close of business on the date such shift
occurs; but in no event prior to the payment date for the dividend or
distribution.

In the event that all or part of a dividend or distribution amount is to be
paid in newly issued Shares, such Shares will be issued to Participants in
accordance with the following formula: (i) if, on the valuation date, the net
asset value per share is less than or equal to the market price per Share, then
the newly issued Shares will be valued at net asset value per Share on the
valuation date provided, however, that if the net asset value is less than 95%
of the market price on the valuation date, then such Shares will be issued at
95% of the market price and (ii) if, on the valuation date, the net asset value
per share is greater than the market price per Share, then the newly issued
Shares will be issued at the market price on the valuation date. The valuation
date will be the dividend or distribution payment date, except that with
respect to Shares issued pursuant to the paragraph above, the valuation date
will be the date such Shares are issued. If a date that would otherwise be a
valuation date is not a Trading Day, the valuation date will be the next
preceding Trading Day.

The open market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities
exchange on which the Shares of the Fund are traded, in the over-the-counter
market or in negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price,
delivery and otherwise as the Agent shall determine. Funds held by the Agent
uninvested will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any event, the
Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability to purchase
Shares within the time periods herein provided, or with the timing of any
purchases effected. The Agent shall have no responsibility as to the value of
the Shares acquired for the Participant's account. The Agent may commingle
amounts of all Participants to be used for open market purchases of Shares and
the price per Share allocable to each Participant in connection with such
purchases shall be the average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
Shares purchased by the Agent.

The Agent will maintain all Participant accounts in the Plan and will furnish
written confirmations of all transactions in each account, including
information needed by Participants for personal and tax records. The Agent will
hold Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan in noncertificated form in the
Participant's name or that of its nominee, and each Participant's proxy will
include those Shares purchased pursuant to the Plan. The Agent will forward to
Participants any proxy solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held
for Participants only in accordance with the proxy returned by Participants to
the Fund. Upon written request, the Agent will deliver to Participants, without
charge, a certificate or certificates for the full Shares.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)


The Agent will confirm to Participants each acquisition made for their
respective accounts as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the
date thereof. Although Participants may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share of the Fund,
no certificates for fractional shares will be issued. Dividends and
distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the
market value of the Fund's Shares at the time of termination less the pro rata
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any share dividends or split shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Agent for Participants will be credited to their respective accounts. In
the event that the Fund makes available to Participants rights to purchase
additional Shares or other securities, the Shares held for Participants under
the Plan will be added to other Shares held by the Participants in calculating
the number of rights to be issued to Participants.

The Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions on all open market purchases.

Participants may terminate their accounts under the Plan by notifying the Agent
in writing or by calling 1-800-331-1710. Such termination will be effective
immediately if notice is received by the Agent not less than ten days prior to
any dividend or distribution record date; otherwise such termination will be
effective on the first Trading Day after the payment due for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be amended or terminated by the Fund as applied to any dividend or capital
gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change or
termination sent to Participants at least 30 days prior to the record date for
the dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan may be amended or
terminated by the Agent, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30
days' written notice to Plan Participants. Notwithstanding the preceding two
sentences, the Agent or the Fund may amend or supplement the Plan at any time
or times when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or rules
or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory
authority. Upon any termination, the Agent will cause a certificate or
certificates for the full Shares held by each Participant under the Plan and
cash adjustment for any fraction to be delivered to each Participant without
charge. If the Participant elects by notice to the Agent in writing in advance
of such termination to have the Agent sell part or all of a Participant's
Shares and remit the proceeds to Participant, the Agent is authorized to deduct
a $2.50 fee plus brokerage commission for this transaction from the proceeds.

Any amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each Participant
unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent receives written notice
of the termination of the Participant's account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the

                                                                        Page 31

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

Agent in its place and stead of a successor Agent under these terms and
conditions, with full power and authority to perform all or any of the acts to
be performed by the Agent under these terms and conditions. Upon any such
appointment of an Agent for the purpose of receiving dividends and
distributions, the Fund will be authorized to pay to such successor Agent, for
each Participant's account, all dividends and distributions payable on Shares
of the Fund held in each Participant's name or under the Plan for retention or
application by such successor Agent as provided in these terms and conditions.

In the case of Participants, such as banks, broker-dealers or other nominees,
which hold Shares for others who are beneficial owners ("Nominee Holders"), the
Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Shares certified
from time to time by each Nominee Holder as representing the total amount
registered in the Nominee Holder's name and held for the account of beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and use its best efforts within
reasonable limits to insure the accuracy of all services performed under this
Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility and
shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by its negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of its
employees.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Agent at P.O.
Box 8030, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8030.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to
         develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the
         Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM"), a
         group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup, Inc.
         ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers that comprise
         CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and
         procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the Manager votes proxies
         relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients.

         In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
         principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest
         of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could
         affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner
         that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
         shareholder values. The Manager may utilize an external service
         provider to provide it with information and/or a recommendation with
         regard to proxy votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
         Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

         In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in
         the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated
         position. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
         principles set forth above and considering such enumerated factors. In
         the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated position or list
         of factors that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a
         case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles set forth
         above. Issues for which there is a stated position set forth in the
         Policies or for which there is a list of factors set forth in the
         Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall into a
         variety of categories, including election of directors, ratification of
         auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses, capital structure issues,
         executive and director

<PAGE>

         compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings, and social and
         environmental issues. The stated position on an issue set forth in the
         Policies can always be superseded, subject to the duty to act solely in
         the best interest of the beneficial owners of accounts, by the
         investment management professionals responsible for the account whose
         shares are being voted. Issues applicable to a particular industry may
         cause CAM to abandon a policy that would have otherwise applied to
         issuers generally. As a result of the independent investment advisory
         services provided by distinct CAM business units, there may be
         occasions when different business units or different portfolio managers
         within the same business unit vote differently on the same issue.

         In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
         interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
         identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the
         Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on
         behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
         periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the
         Manager) in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware
         of the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting
         proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
         relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise during
         the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring
         conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
         compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a list
         of significant relationships that could present a conflict of interest
         for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the
         fact that a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and
         a non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner
         in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such
         issuer. Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized
         non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for prudential
         reasons treats as a potential conflict of interest because such
         relationship might appear to the public to influence the manner in
         which the Manager decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes
         the position that non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and an issuer
         (e.g. investment banking or banking) do not present a conflict of
         interest for the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer.
         Such position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
         independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as well
         as on the existence of information barriers between the Manager and
         certain other Citigroup business units.

         CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
         are members, to review and address conflicts of interest brought to its
         attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that will be voted in
         accordance with a stated position on an issue or in accordance with the
         recommendation of an independent third party is not brought to the
         attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of interest
         review because the Manager's position is that to the extent a conflict
         of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in accordance with a
         pre-determined policy or in accordance with the recommendation of an
         independent third party. With respect to a conflict of interest brought
         to its attention, the

<PAGE>

         Proxy Voting Committee first determines whether such conflict of
         interest is material. A conflict of interest is considered material to
         the extent that it is determined that such conflict is likely to
         influence, or appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making in
         voting proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that
         a conflict of interest is not material, the Manager may vote proxies
         notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
         determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
         before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
         determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
         including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
         conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
         interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict
         to clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
         clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
         behalf.

             (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
             report) that have materially affected, or are likely to materially
