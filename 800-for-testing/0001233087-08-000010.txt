ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

The U.S. economy slowed during the 12 months ended March 31, 2008, as gross
domestic product (GDP) growth decelerated sharply and registered an annualized
rate of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008. This was a
significant change from the third quarter's fairly robust 4.9% annualized
growth, which was the highest in more than seven years. A softening labor
market, tighter credit conditions and ongoing housing market weakness rattled
consumer confidence and hurt consumer spending. These factors as well as upward
inflationary pressures from rising food, energy and commodity prices, and a
weaker dollar significantly weighed on the overall economy.

Volatile oil prices reached a historical high in March, topping $110 per barrel
before retreating to $102 by period-end. Core inflation, which excludes food and
energy costs, rose modestly for the period, signaling that inflation risk
remains. For March 2008, core inflation had a 12-month increase of 2.4%. (1) The
Federal Reserve Board's (Fed's) preferred measure of inflation, the core
personal consumption expenditures price index, reported a 12-month increase of
2.1%. (2)

As financial market turmoil and investor uncertainty persisted, the Fed
remained committed to act in an effort to restore confidence and liquidity to
U.S. financial markets. The Fed implemented a number of programs to buffer
downside risk, such as a $200 billion package to increase liquidity to banks, an
extension on direct credit lines to non-banking financial service companies and
the orchestration of Bear Stearns' acquisition by JPMorgan Chase. The Fed cut
interest rates five times over the 12-month period, bringing the federal funds
target rate to 2.25%. In addition, regulators eased capital requirements on
government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Despite the Fed's aggressive
actions, U.S. Treasuries rallied in a flight to quality and equities continued
to fall during the period.

Over the period, as investors sought the relative safety of short-term U.S.
Treasuries, Treasury yields declined and the yield curve steepened. Short-term,
two- and five-year yields declined substantially, with the two-year bill
yielding 1.62% at the end of March, down from 4.58% 12 months prior. The 10-year
U.S. Treasury note ended March yielding 3.45%, compared with 4.65% at the
beginning of the period.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The fiscal year under review was characterized by volatility and the emergence
of one of the largest financial crises in decades. The period began with strong
economic growth leading to inflationary concerns. However, fear and uncertainty
took hold as subprime mortgage delinquencies led to a significant credit crunch.
After rising initially on inflation fears, U.S. Treasury yields began falling in
June 2007 and many ended the period more than 100 basis points (100 basis points
equal one percentage point) below where they began. Declining interest rates and
a flight to quality boosted returns of mortgage-backed securities, which were
the Fund's best performing asset class during the period. High yield corporate
bonds and leveraged bank loans, however,

were negatively affected by the market's general risk aversion. Although default
rates remained relatively low during the period for both asset classes, fears of
a recession and  expectations  for  increasing  default rates in the near future
contributed to rising risk premiums. In addition, high yield corporate bonds and
leveraged bank loans suffered from technical factors, as financing for leveraged
buyouts (LBOs) that were arranged in a more favorable  environment  still needed
to come to market.  The  increased  spreads on these assets more than offset the
decline in interest rates and the interest earned on the securities.  Therefore,
both asset classes  experienced  negative  returns during the fiscal year. In an
effort to take advantage of opportunities created by market volatility, the Fund
increased  its  exposure to bank loans and reduced its  weighting  in high yield
corporate  bonds.  Our  exposure  to  mortgage-backed   and  other  asset-backed
securities was roughly unchanged.

As the fiscal year began,  strong corporate earnings and balance sheet liquidity
contributed to a healthy fundamental environment for high yield corporate bonds.
As a result,  the  default  rate was low and  credit  spreads  above  Treasuries
tightened  to a record low of 265 basis  points in early June.  Subprime  market
turmoil and the resulting  credit crunch,  however,  led to fears of a recession
and expectations that default rates could rise. In addition,  despite a somewhat
reduced forward  calendar of LBO transactions  from summer 2007 levels,  pending
supply weighed on the sector at period-end. Consequently, credit spreads widened
significantly  and ended the period  nearly 800 basis points  above  Treasuries,
more than three  times as much as in June and the  highest  level in five years.
Although  spreads  were  above  the  historical   average  at  period-end,   the
fundamental  outlook for the asset class was uncertain.  In our view,  corporate
balance  sheets  were  generally  favorable,  but  a  recession  could  lead  to
increasing  default  rates.  During  the  Fund's  fiscal  year,  we  found  more
attractive  investment  opportunities in other asset classes, in particular bank
loans and investment grade corporate bonds.

Similar to high yield  corporate  bonds,  bank loans enjoyed a favorable  market
environment  early  in  the  fiscal  year,  followed  by  rapidly  deteriorating
fundamental and technical  factors  beginning in July. As investor risk aversion
increased,  structured products such as collateralized  loan obligations,  which
previously had accounted for about two-thirds of purchases of all loans, nearly

                               4 | Annual Report

disappeared from the market. Therefore, spreads widened to attract new buyers to
the asset class. At the same time, banks held a large supply of loans from
previous LBO funding commitments, which further pressured the market. In
addition, as the Fed cut short-term interest rates in an effort to boost the
economy, bank loan yields fell. As loan prices fell, some investors that
employed leverage to purchase loans were forced to unload some of their
positions, putting yet more pressure on the market. Largely as a result, average
secondary loan prices fell to a period low in February before rebounding and
stabilizing at higher levels as investors found value at the lower levels.

At period-end, the market seemed to be pricing in a default rate that would be
worse than the last down cycle of 2001-2002. However, the 1.7% default rate at
the end of March was below the historical average, and companies within our bank
loan portfolio performed adequately. (3) With spreads above previous levels and
bid prices close to historical lows, we found what we believed were attractive
long-term investment opportunities in light of valuations that were attractive
on a historical basis and relative to high yield corporate bonds.

Over the Fund's fiscal year, agency mortgage-backed securities generally
outperformed the Fund's other primary investment sectors. Within an environment
of increased volatility and uncertainty, the overall mortgage-backed securities
market performed relatively well. As spreads in many fixed income sectors
widened relative to Treasuries, markets experienced a flight to quality that
benefited GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC securities due to their government backing or
sponsorship. On the other hand, securities from privately issued companies, as
well as some other asset-backed securities, tended to generate lower returns.
With tightening credit standards and slowing housing and refinancing activity
during the period, prepayments declined across all coupons and program types.
Consistent with our strategy, we increased the Fund's allocation to higher
coupon mortgage-backed securities and found investment opportunities in those
sectors that experienced widening yield spreads and were hampered by relatively
low liquidity.

PRICE AND YIELD. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER-YIELDING, LOWER-RATED
SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT AND LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.

1. Figures are for common shares. As of March 31, 2008, the Trust had leverage
   in the amount of 35.58% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust employs
   leverage through the issuance of Auction Preferred Shares. The use of
   financial leverage creates an opportunity for increased income but, at the
   same time, creates special risks (including the likelihood of greater
   volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares). The cost of
   leverage rises and falls with changes in short-term interest rates. Such
   increases/decreases in the cost of the Trust's leverage may be offset by
   increased/decreased income from the Trust's floating rate investments.

2. Total return calculations represent the cumulative and average annual changes
   in value of an investment over the periods indicated.

3. Assumes reinvestment of distributions at net asset value.

4. Assumes reinvestment of distributions based on the dividend reinvestment
   plan.

5. Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the Fund's 8.4 cent per
   share March dividend and the AMEX closing price of $10.94 on 3/31/08.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The Fund's Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (Plan) offers you a prompt and simple way
to reinvest dividends and capital gain  distributions  (Distributions) in shares
of the Fund. PFPC, Inc. (Agent), P.O. Box 43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will
act as your Agent in administering  the Plan. The Agent will open an account for
you under the Plan in the same name as your  outstanding  shares are registered.
The  complete  Terms  and  Conditions  of the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  are
contained in the Fund's  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  Brochure.  A copy of that
Brochure may be obtained  from the Fund at the address on the back cover of this
report.

You  are  automatically  enrolled  in the  Plan  unless  you  elect  to  receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a  Distribution,  you, as a participant  in the Plan,  will
automatically  receive an equivalent  amount of shares of the Fund  purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the  payment  date for a  Distribution,  the net asset  value per share is
equal to or less  than the  market  price  per share  plus  estimated  brokerage
commissions,  the Agent shall receive newly issued shares,  including fractions,
from the Fund for your account.  The number of additional  shares to be credited
shall be  determined by dividing the dollar  amount of the  Distribution  by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net  asset  value per share  exceeds  the  market  price  plus  estimated
brokerage  commissions on the payment date for a  Distribution,  the Agent (or a
broker-dealer  selected  by the Agent)  shall try,  for a purchase  period of 30
days,  to apply the amount of such  Distribution  on your shares  (less your pro
rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred)  to purchase  shares on the open
market.  The weighted  average price  (including  brokerage  commissions) of all
shares it purchases  shall be your  allocated  price per share.  If,  before the
Agent has completed its  purchases,  the market price plus  estimated  brokerage
commissions  exceeds the net asset  value of the shares as of the payment  date,
the purchase  price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such  Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund.  Participants  should note that they will not
be able to  instruct  the Agent to  purchase  shares at a specific  time or at a
specific  price.  The Agent may make  open-market  purchases  on any  securities
exchange  where  shares  are  traded,  in  the  over-the-counter  market  or  in
negotiated  transactions,  and may be on such  terms as to price,  delivery  and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.

                               9 | Annual Report

<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the  American  Stock  Exchange,  or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date.  The net asset value per share on a  particular  date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services  performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no  responsibility
and shall not be liable  for loss or damage due to errors  unless  such error is
caused by the Agent's  negligence,  bad faith, or willful  misconduct or that of
its employees.  Your uninvested  funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash  investments,  the Agent may commingle  your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting  Distributions,  since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open  market,  each  participant  will pay a pro rata  portion of any  brokerage
commissions  incurred.  If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the  proceeds,  the Agent will deduct  brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic  reinvestment of  Distributions  does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on  Distributions.  In connection  with the  reinvestment of
Distributions,  shareholders  generally  will be  treated  as having  received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation  material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance  with the  instructions  set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund,  and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return  to  the  Fund  in the  same  portion  as the  Agent  votes  proxies  the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you  participate  in the Plan,  the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience  provides  added  protection  against  loss,  theft  or  inadvertent
destruction  of  certificates.  However,  you  may  request  that a  certificate
representing  your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request,  the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your  account  as soon as  practicable,  but not  later  than 60 days  after the
acquisition  date.  Although  from  time to  time  you  may  have  an  undivided
fractional  interest in a share of the Fund,  no  certificates  for a fractional
share

                                10 | Annual Report

<PAGE>

will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to your
account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will adjust for
any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of shares at
the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at 1-800/331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (Fund) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a diversified,
closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities, government securities, mortgage pass-through
securities, other mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and note transactions, to
assist in determining a current market value for each security. The Fund's
pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing which considers
information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions, quotations
from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities that are considered
comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date,
option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and
yield curves, to determine current value.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis, to determine
current value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A. SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED OR DELAYED DELIVERY BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis,
with payment and delivery scheduled for a future date. These transactions are
subject to market fluctuations and are subject to the risk that the value at
delivery may be more or less than the trade date purchase price. Although the
Fund will generally purchase these securities with the intention of holding the
securities, it may sell the securities before the settlement date. Sufficient
assets have been segregated for these securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund enters into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a to-be-announced (TBA)
basis. Mortgage dollar rolls are agreements between the fund and a financial
institution to simultaneously sell and repurchase mortgage-backed securities at
a future date. Gains or losses are realized on the initial sale, and the
difference between the repurchase price and the sale price is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss to the fund upon entering into the mortgage dollar roll.
In addition, the Fund may earn interest on the cash proceeds that are received
from the initial sale. During the period between the sale and repurchase, the
Fund is not entitled to principal and interest paid on the mortgage backed
securities. The risks of mortgage dollar roll transactions include the potential
inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations.

F. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

G. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of March 31, 2008, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

H. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined
according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings
determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are
reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent
periods.

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust's (Trust) organizational
documents, its officers and trustees are indemnified by the Trust against
certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts
with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future

claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. Currently,
the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At March 31, 2008, there were 28,290,000 common shares authorized (without par
value). During the year ended March 31, 2008, there were 34,261 shares issued
for $490,071 from reinvested distributions. During the year ended March 31,
2007, there were no shares issued; all reinvested distributions were satisfied
with previously issued shares purchased in the open market.

On November 7, 2003 the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. Dividends to
preferred shareholders are cumulative and are declared weekly, at rates
established through an auction process. During the year ended March 31, 2008,
the dividends on Preferred Shares ranged from 3.65% to 6.15%. The weekly
auctions for Series M, W and F have failed since February 13, 2008;
consequently, the dividend rate paid on the preferred shares has moved to the
maximum rate as defined in the prospectus.

The Fund is required to maintain, on a weekly basis, a specified discounted
value of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch
Ratings and Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset
coverage for the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the year ended March 31, 2008, all requirements were met.

10. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 62.10% of its portfolio invested in high yield, senior secured
floating rate notes, or other securities rated below investment grade. These
securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price
volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default
than higher rated securities.

11. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrowers' discretion. Funded portions of credit agreements are presented on the
Statement of Investments.

At March 31, 2008, unfunded commitments were as follows:

</TABLE>

Unfunded loan commitments and funded portions of credit agreements are marked to
market daily and any unrealized gain or loss is included in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities and Statement of Operations.

12. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares (marketing support), Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators and governmental entities.
Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among others,
concerning market timing and marketing support.

On May 9, 2008, the SEC approved a final plan of distribution for the Company's
market timing settlement. Disbursements of settlement monies will be made
promptly to individuals who were shareholders of the designated funds during the
relevant period, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement
and plan.

12. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS (CONTINUED)

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above.

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Funds, it is
committed to making the Funds or their shareholders whole, as appropriate.

13. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Fund
believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will have no material impact on its financial
statements.

In March 2008, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
(SFAS 161), which expands disclosures about derivative investments and hedging
activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Fund is currently
evaluating the impact, if any, of applying the various provisions of SFAS 161.

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On May 20, 2008, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved a plan to redeem
$100,000,000 of the Fund's auction rate preferred shares, to be funded through
the use of mortgage dollar rolls. The partial redemption will be offered on a
pro rata basis across the three series of preferred shares and is anticipated to
be completed in June 2008.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FRANKLIN TEMPLETON LIMITED DURATION
INCOME TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust (the "Fund") at March 31, 2008, the results of its operations for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods
presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at March
31, 2008 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Franklin Templeton
Limited Duration Income Trust

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held February 25, 2008, the Board of Trustees (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust (Fund). In reaching this decision, the Board took into account information
furnished throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information
prepared specifically in connection with the annual renewal review process.
Information furnished and discussed throughout the year included investment
performance reports on the Fund, information on its share price discount to net
asset value, and other related financial information, as well as periodic
reports on legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates.
Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process
included a report prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent
organization, as well as a Fund profitability analysis report prepared by
management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's investment performance and
expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable to the Fund as selected by
Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report discussed the profitability to
Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall U.S. fund operations, as well as
on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included with such profitability analysis
report was information on a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and
other accounts they manage, as well as information on management fees charged by
the Manager and its affiliates including management's explanation of differences
where relevant, and a three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any
increase in expense ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a
memorandum prepared by management describing project initiatives and capital
investments relating to the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin
Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to
economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

complex, the adherence to fair value pricing procedures established by the
Board, and the accuracy of net asset value calculations. Favorable consideration
was given to management's efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up
systems and recovery procedures to function in the event of a natural disaster,
it being noted by the Board that such systems and procedures had functioned
smoothly during the Florida hurricanes and blackouts experienced in recent
years. Among other factors taken into account by the Board were the Manager's
best execution trading policies, including a favorable report by an independent
portfolio trading analytical firm. Consideration was also given to the
experience of the Fund's portfolio management team, the number of accounts
managed and general method of compensation. In this latter respect, the Board
noted that a primary factor in management's determination of the level of a
portfolio manager's bonus compensation was the relative investment performance
of the funds he or she managed and that a portion of such bonus was required to
be invested in a predesignated list of funds within such person's fund
management area so as to be aligned with the interests of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper report furnished for the agreement renewals.
The Lipper report prepared for the Fund showed its investment performance in
comparison with a performance universe consisting of the Fund and six other
leveraged closed-end BBB-rated corporate debt funds as selected by Lipper during
2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, being the Fund's first four full years of operation.
Such report considers both income return and total return on a net asset value
basis without regard to market discounts or premiums to accurately reflect
investment performance. The Lipper report showed the Fund's 2007 income return
was above the median of such performance universe and on an annualized basis was
at the median of such universe for the four-year period ended December 31, 2007.
The Lipper report showed the Fund's 2007 total return was the second-lowest in
such performance universe, but on an annualized basis was within three basis
points of the median of such universe for the four-year period ended December
31, 2007. The Board felt such performance was acceptable in view of the Fund's
investment mandate to invest in securities with limited interest rate
sensitivities with at least 50 percent of its assets being invested in high
yield corporate bonds and corporate bank loans.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a Lipper
expense group consisting of the Fund and four other leveraged closed-end
BBB-rated corporate debt funds as selected by Lipper. Prior to making such
comparison, the Board relied upon a survey showing that the scope of services
covered under the Fund's investment management agreement was similar to those
provided by fund managers to other fund groups. In reviewing comparative costs,
emphasis was

given to the Fund's contractual investment management fee rate in comparison
with the contractual investment management fee that would have been charged by
other funds within its Lipper expense group assuming they were similar in size
to the Fund, as well as the actual total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison
with those of its Lipper expense group. The Lipper contractual investment
management fee analysis includes administrative charges as being part of
contractual investment management fees. The results of such expense comparisons
showed that the Fund's contractual investment management fee rate and total
expense ratios were both the second highest in its Lipper expense group, but
that the Fund's contractual investment management expense ratio was within 10
basis points of the Lipper expense group median, and its total expense ratio was
less than half a basis point above its Lipper expense group median. The Board
found such expenses to be acceptable.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund. Specific attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating
costs to the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies are
inherently subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be
reasonable while producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted
that, while being continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's
own cost accounting, such cost allocation methodology was consistent with that
followed in profitability report presentations made in prior years and that the
Fund's independent registered public accounting firm had been engaged by the
Manager to perform certain procedures on a biennial basis, specified and
approved by the Manager and the Fund's Board solely for their purposes and use
in reference to the profitability analysis. In reviewing and discussing such
analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that costs incurred in
establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of fund operations
conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully reflected in the
expenses allocated to each Fund in determining its profitability, as well as the
fact that the level of profits, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost
savings and efficiencies initiated by management. In addition, the Board
considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the Manager's
parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers broken
down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution
expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses. The Board
also considered the extent to which the Manager and its affiliates might derive
ancillary benefits from fund operations, as well as potential benefits resulting
from allocation of fund brokerage and the use of "soft" commission dollars to
pay for research. Based upon its consideration of all these factors, the Board
determined that the level of profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates
from providing services to the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature,
quality and extent of services provided.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders and intends to monitor
future growth of the Fund accordingly.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of
another independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy
directly to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If
the conflict is not resolved by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter,
along with the recommended course of action by the manager to an
interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include portfolio managers
and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting
instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation
of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third party provider
of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group
or the Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of trustees or a
committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on Sections 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or pursuant to
an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests uninvested cash in affiliated
money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive order ("cash sweep
arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's governing documents
or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment manager will vote the
shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the
fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

</TABLE>

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
   team of  investment  professionals.  Accordingly,  the  individual  manager
   listed would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures help to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. The separate management of the trade execution and
valuation functions from the portfolio management process also helps to reduce
potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected for funds or
accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected for the
Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         Franklin Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and mutual fund shares (17.5%
         to 25%). The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to build a
         vested interest of the portfolio manager in the financial performance
         of both Franklin Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The
         bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
         compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving
         consistently strong investment performance, which aligns the financial
         incentives of the portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief
         Investment Officer of the manager and/or other officers of the manager,
         with responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of
         annual bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin
         Templeton guidelines. The following factors are generally used in
         determining bonuses under the plan:

o  INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.  Primary  consideration  is given to the  historic
   investment  performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding years of all accounts
   managed by the  portfolio  manager.  The pre-tax  performance  of each fund
   managed is measured  relative to a relevant  peer group  and/or  applicable
   benchmark as appropriate.

o  NON-INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.   The  more  qualitative  contributions  of  a
   portfolio manager to the manager's  business and the investment  management
   team, including  professional  knowledge,  productivity,  responsiveness to
   client needs and communication,  are evaluated in determining the amount of
   any bonus award.

o  RESPONSIBILITIES.  The  characteristics  and complexity of funds managed by
   the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's appraisal.

     ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED  COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may also
     be  awarded  restricted  shares  or units of  Franklin  Resources  stock or
     restricted  shares or units of one or more  mutual  funds,  and  options to
     purchase common shares of Franklin Resources stock. Awards of such deferred
     equity-based  compensation  typically  vest  over  time,  so as  to  create
     incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,

disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised March 06, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.


III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
