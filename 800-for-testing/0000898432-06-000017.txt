CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds, for the fiscal year ending October 31,
2005. The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Funds'
investments, and their audited financial statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide current income exempt from
regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific fund, current income
exempt from that state's personal income taxes (and in the case of the New York
Fund, New York City personal income tax).

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds because our experience and
research indicate strongly that this maturity range has historically offered the
best risk/reward profile on the yield curve, providing much of the return of
longer-term bonds--with less volatility and risk.

We believe that our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax exempt current income over
the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

PETER SUNDMAN
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
CALIFORNIA INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL FUND INC.

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS PORTFOLIO COMMENTARIES

We are pleased to report that, on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, all three of
Neuberger Berman's Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds delivered positive
returns and materially outperformed the Lehman Brothers 10-Year Municipal Bond
Index for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2005.

Municipal bonds performed in line with the broad fixed income market during this
12-month reporting period, with prices remaining relatively stable from November
2004 through January 2005, declining in February and March, rallying in April,
and then retreating again in September and October. The market's ups and downs
were largely the result of mixed signals on the strength of the economy and the
outlook for inflation. Eight Federal Reserve rate hikes totaling 2.00% over the
course of the fiscal year (with a ninth on November 1, the day after fiscal year
end) kept a ceiling on intermediate-term bond prices.

An increase in state and local tax revenues resulting from the robust economy
has strengthened municipal balance sheets. While credit quality has improved, a
new credit issue emerged this year. The problems facing General Motors and
United Airlines due to large under-funded pensions have focused investor
attention on the financial soundness of municipal issuers' pension plans. This,
in turn, has become a more important element in our credit analysis.

Looking ahead, we continue to focus on economic data relating to inflation and
its likely impact on Fed policy. Although third quarter 2005 GDP growth has been
revised upward to 4.3%, we are seeing early signs that economic growth is
starting to moderate. In the second week of November, leading homebuilder Toll
Brothers warned investors about slowing sales--an indication that the vibrant
new housing market may be losing momentum. Existing home inventories have also
been rising in many areas of the country. Despite still strong consumer
spending, softening home prices could prove a blow to consumer confidence. Also,
as the weather cools, high home heating costs may put more pressure on household
budgets, which could dampen holiday sales. If more evidence emerges that the
housing bubble is deflating and if Christmas proves less than jolly for
retailers, the Fed may begin to worry about overplaying its hand and consider
easing its foot off the monetary brakes sooner rather than later.

We are likely to maintain the portfolios' conservative posture until we see
convincing evidence that the economy is decelerating and that the Fed is closer
to declaring victory over inflation, at which point we may become somewhat more
aggressive. All told, however, we believe that municipal bond investors should
be encouraged by how well municipal securities have held up during a prolonged
period of Fed tightening and by the fact that yields are now significantly more
generous than in recent years.

CALIFORNIA INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL FUND INC.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered. There is
an initial public offering and once issued, common shares of closed-end funds
are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

The composition, industries and holdings of the Funds are subject to change.
Investment return will fluctuate. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in securities by Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal
     Fund Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", and collectively,
     the "Funds") are valued daily by obtaining bid price quotations from
     independent pricing services on all securities available in each service's
     data base. For all other securities, bid prices are obtained from principal
     market makers in those securities or, if quotations are not readily
     available, by methods the Funds' Board of Directors has approved on the
     belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may be considered
     when determining the fair value of a security, including available analyst,
     media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer
     of the security being fair valued has other securities outstanding.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.

@    At time of investment, municipal securities purchased by the Funds are
     within the four highest rating categories (with respect to at least 80% of
     total assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating
     organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
     Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where not rated, are
     determined by the Funds' investment manager to be of comparable quality.
     Approximately 78%, 72%, and 57% of the municipal securities held by
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, have credit
     enhancement features backing them, which the Funds may rely on, such as
     letters of credit, insurance, or guarantees. Without these credit
     enhancement features the securities may or may not meet the quality
     standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported by securities in
     escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, or
     instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay the periodic
     interest due and the principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give the Funds
     the right to sell back the issue on the date specified.

++   Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

**   Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold, normally to qualified
     institutional buyers under Rule 144A, and have been deemed by the adviser
     to be liquid. At October 31, 2005, these securities amounted to $4,500,000
     or 1.5% of net assets for Intermediate.

^^   Not rated by a NRSRO.

@@   Credit Ratings are unaudited.

#    All or a portion of this security was purchased on a when-issued basis. At
     October 31, 2005, these securities amounted to $2,000,000 or .66% of net
     assets for Intermediate.

###  All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for
     when-issued purchase commitments.

^    Floating rate securities are securities whose yields vary with a designated
     market index or market rate. These securities are shown at their current
     rates as of October 31, 2005.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS

       NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

    1  GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
       ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
       ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal
       Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund" and, collectively, the
       "Funds") were organized as Maryland corporations on July 29, 2002.
       California and New York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end
       management investment companies and Intermediate is registered as a
       diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
       Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Each Fund's Board of
       Directors may classify or re-classify any unissued shares of capital
       stock into one or more classes of preferred stock without the approval of
       shareholders.

       The assets of each Fund belong only to that Fund, and the liabilities of
       each Fund are borne solely by that Fund and no other.

       The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
       accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
       ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
       financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    2  PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
       notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

    3  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions
       are recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income, including accretion
       of discount (adjusted for original issue discount, where applicable) and
       amortization of premium, where applicable, is recorded on the accrual
       basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are
       recorded on the basis of identified cost and stated in the Statements of
       Operations.

    4  INCOME TAX INFORMATION: Each Fund is treated as a separate entity for
       U.S. Federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to
       continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with
       the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
       to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of
       its earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income or excise
       tax provision is required.

       Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
       accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
       generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
       due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
       securities held by each Fund, timing differences and differing
       characterization of distributions made by each Fund as a whole.

       As determined on October 31, 2005, there were no permanent differences
       resulting from different book and tax accounting reclassified at year
       end.

       The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October
       31, 2005 and October 31, 2004 was as follows:

       As of October 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings
       (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as follows:

</Table>

       The difference between book basis and tax basis distributable earnings is
       attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments.

       To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be
       offset by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not
       to distribute such gains. As determined at October 31, 2005, the Funds
       had unused capital loss carryforwards available for Federal income tax
       purposes to offset net realized capital gains, if any, as follows:

    5  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net of expenses,
       daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to declare and
       pay distributions to common shareholders from net investment income on a
       monthly basis. Distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, are
       normally distributed in December. Income distributions and capital gain
       distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date.
       Distributions to preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as
       described in Note A-7.

       Subsequent to October 31, 2005, each Fund declared two monthly
       distributions to common shareholders payable December 15, 2005 and
       January 17, 2006, to shareholders of record on November 25, 2005 and
       December 27, 2005, respectively, with ex-dates of November 22, 2005 and
       December 22, 2005, respectively, as follows:

    6  EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
       Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund.
       Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
       includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which
       Management serves as investment manager, that are not directly attributed
       to a Fund are allocated among the Funds and the other investment
       companies in the complex or series thereof on the basis of relative net
       assets, except where a more appropriate allocation of expenses to each
       investment company in the complex or series thereof can otherwise be made
       fairly.

    7  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds re-classified
       unissued shares of capital stock into several series of Auction Market
       Preferred Shares ("AMPS"), as follows:

</Table>

       All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of
       $25,000 per share plus any accumulated unpaid distributions, whether or
       not earned or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon
       ("Liquidation Value"). Distributions to AMPS shareholders, which are
       cumulative, are accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay
       distributions every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28
       days for each Fund's AMPS Series B, unless in a special rate period.

       In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset
       every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an
       auction. Each Fund has approved a special rate period for its AMPS Series
       A of 728 days for California and New York and 546 days for Intermediate.
       The effective dates and distribution rates for each Fund are as follows:

       The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part,
       on the second business day preceding any distribution payment date at
       Liquidation Value.

       The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
       Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
       declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
       shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at
       Liquidation Value.

       The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
       holders of common stock as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
       separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the
       Funds' charter. The holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a separate class,
       are entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to
       elect a majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund failed to pay
       distributions on AMPS for two consecutive years.

    8  CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
       held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
       developments, including those particular to a specific industry or
       region. The investment policies of California and New York involve
       investing substantially all of their assets in municipal bonds of issuers
       located in the state of California and the state of New York,
       respectively. This policy makes those Funds more susceptible to adverse
       economic, political, regulatory or other factors affecting the issuers of
       such municipal bonds than a fund that does not limit its investments to
       such issuers.

    9  INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Funds' organizational
       documents provide that their officers and directors are indemnified
       against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
       duties to the Funds. In addition, both in some of their principal service
       contracts and in the normal course of their business, the Funds enter
       into contracts that provide indemnifications to other parties for certain
       types of losses or liabilities. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these
       arrangements is unknown as this could involve future claims against each
       Fund.

       NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
       AFFILIATES:

       Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
       Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
       Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed
       Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less
       liabilities other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for
       purposes of leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the
       Liquidation Value of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

       Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
       fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the following annual
       rates:

<Table>

                  2005 - 2007                     0.25%
                     2008                         0.20
                     2009                         0.15
                     2010                         0.10
                     2011                         0.05
</Table>

       Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
       31, 2011.

       For the year ended October 31, 2005, such waived fees amounted to
       $402,264, $1,226,157, and $327,198 for California, Intermediate, and New
       York, respectively.

       Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
       Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
       rate of 0.30% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
       Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
       ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
       Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
       under the agreement.

       Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the
       New York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to each Fund, are wholly-owned
       subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly-owned holding
       company. Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with
       investment recommendations and research information without added cost to
       each Fund. Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of each
       Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

       Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
       custodian contract. For the year ended October 31, 2005, the impact of
       this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $1,238, $1,142, and
       $1,205 for California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

       In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund pays,
       through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
       broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
       held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
       period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate
       of 1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or
       more, the service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the
       broker-dealer.

       Each Fund has paid Merrill Lynch a fee equal to 1/8 of 1% in connection
       with entering the special rate periods in return for which Merrill Lynch
       had agreed to pay dividends on the AMPS that, as a result of the auction,
       exceed a specified rate.

       In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, each Fund is required
       to provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that
       each Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal
       to or greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which
       is a minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
       maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
       fact that the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
       calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
       rates determined by the rating agencies. Each Fund pays a fee to State
       Street for the preparation of this report which is included in the "Basic
       Maintenance Expense" on the Statement of Operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS

+  Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
   changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each fiscal
   period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the purchase of
   common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of common shares
   at the market price on the last day of the period indicated. Dividends and
   distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   each Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent past performance
   and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may be lower or higher
   than the performance data quoted. For each Fund, total return would have been
   lower if Management had not waived the investment management fee. Performance
   data current to the most recent month-end are available at www.nb.com.

#  The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
   consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset arrangements.

@@ After waiver of investment management fee. Had Management not undertaken such
   action, the annualized ratios of net expenses to average daily net assets
   applicable to common shareholders would have been:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of
Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc. (the "Funds"), including the schedules of investments, as of
October 31, 2005, and the related statements of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc., at October 31, 2005, the results of their operations for
the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and their financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

                                       39
<Page>

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting held on September 21, 2005, the Boards of Directors (collectively
the "Boards," each a "Board") of Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. and
Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. (each a "Fund"),
including the Directors who are not "interested persons" of each Fund
("Independent Fund Directors"), approved continuance of the Management and
Sub-Advisory Agreements ("Agreements") for each Fund.

In evaluating the Agreements, the Boards, including the Independent Fund
Directors, reviewed materials furnished by Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC
("Neuberger") in response to questions submitted by counsel to the Independent
Fund Directors, and met with senior representatives of Management and Neuberger
regarding their personnel and operations. The Independent Fund Directors were
advised by counsel that is experienced in Investment Company Act of 1940 matters
and that is independent of Management and Neuberger. The Independent Fund
Directors received a memorandum from independent counsel discussing the legal
standards for their consideration of the proposed continuance of the Agreements.
They met with such counsel separately from representatives of Management to
discuss the annual contract review. The annual contract review extends over two
regular meetings of the Boards to ensure that Management and Neuberger have time
to respond to any questions the Independent Fund Directors may have on their
initial review of the report and that the Independent Fund Directors have time
to consider those responses. In addition, during this process, the Boards held a
separate meeting devoted to reviewing and discussing Fund performance.

Each Board considered the following factors, among others, in connection with
its approval of the continuance of the Agreements: (1) the nature, extent, and
quality of the services to be provided by Management and Neuberger; (2) the
performance of each Fund compared to relevant market indices and a peer group of
investment companies; (3) the costs of the services to be provided and profits
historically realized by Management and its affiliates from the relationship
with the Funds; (4) the extent to which economies of scale might be realized as
each Fund grows; and (5) whether fee levels reflect those potential economies of
scale for the benefit of investors in each Fund. In their deliberations, the
members of each Board did not identify any particular information that was
all-important or controlling, and each Director may have attributed different
weights to the various factors.

Each Board evaluated the terms of the Agreements and whether the Agreements were
in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders. Each Board considered,
with respect to each Fund, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided under the Agreements and the overall fairness of the Agreements to the
Funds. The Boards requested and evaluated a report from Management and Neuberger
that addressed specific factors designed to inform the Boards' consideration of
these and other issues. The Boards also retained an independent consultant to
provide additional data.

With respect to the nature, extent and quality of the services provided, each
Board considered the performance of each Fund and the degree of risk undertaken
by the portfolio manager(s). The Boards considered the experience and staffing
of portfolio management and the investment research personnel of Management and
Neuberger dedicated to performing services for the Funds. The Boards noted that
Management also provides certain administrative services, including fund
accounting and compliance oversight. The Boards also considered Management's and
Neuberger's policies and practices regarding brokerage and allocation of
portfolio transactions for the Funds. In addition, the Boards noted the positive
compliance history of Management and Neuberger, as each firm has been free of
significant compliance problems.

With respect to the performance of each Fund, each Board considered the
performance of each Fund on both a market return and net asset value basis
relative to its benchmark and a peer group of investment companies pursuing
broadly similar strategies. Each Board also considered the performance in
relation to the degree of risk undertaken by the portfolio manager(s). In the
case of those Funds that had underperformed their peer group and/or relevant
market indices, each Board discussed each Fund's performance with Management and
discussed steps that Management had taken, or intended to take, to improve each
Fund's performance. The Boards also considered Management's resources and
responsiveness with respect to the Funds that experienced lagging performance.

With respect to the overall fairness of the Agreements, the Boards considered
the fee structure of the Agreements as compared to a peer group of comparable
funds and any fall-out benefits likely to accrue to Management or Neuberger or
their affiliates. The Boards also considered the profitability of Management and
its affiliates from their association with the Funds.

                                       53
<Page>

The Boards received a detailed report from an independent consultant that
compares each Fund's management fee and overall expense ratio to a peer group of
comparable funds. Each Board considered the range and average of the management
fees and expense ratios of the peer group. With regard to the sub-advisory fee
paid to Neuberger, the Boards noted that this fee is reflective of an "at cost"
basis and there is no profit to Neuberger with regard to these fees. Each Board
considered each Fund's overall expenses in relation to the overall expenses of
the peer group median. In addition, each Board considered the contractual waiver
of a portion of the management fee undertaken by Management for each Fund.

The Boards considered whether there were other funds that were sub-advised by
Management or its affiliates or separate accounts managed by Management with
similar investment objectives, policies and strategies as the Funds. The Boards
noted that there were no comparable sub-advised funds or separate accounts.

Each Board also evaluated any actual or anticipated economies of scale in
relation to the services Management provides to each Fund. The Boards considered
that each Fund was a closed-end fund that is not continuously offering shares
and that, without daily inflows and outflows of capital, there were not at this
time significant economies of scale to be realized by Management in managing
each Fund's assets.

In concluding that the benefits accruing to Management and its affiliates by
virtue of their relationship to the Funds were reasonable in comparison with the
costs of providing the investment advisory services and the benefits accruing to
each Fund, each Board reviewed specific data as to Management's profit or loss
on each Fund for a recent period and the trend in profit or loss since each
Fund's inception. The Boards also carefully examined Management's cost
allocation methodology and had an independent expert review the methodology. It
also reviewed an analysis from an independent data service on investment
management profitability margins. The Boards also reviewed whether Management
and Neuberger used brokers to execute Fund transactions that provide research
and other services to Management and Neuberger, and the types of benefits
potentially derived by the Funds and by other clients of Management and
Neuberger from such services. The Boards recognized that Management should be
entitled to earn a reasonable level of profits for services it provides to the
Funds and, based on its review, concluded it was satisfied that Management's
level of profitability from its relationship with the Funds was not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

In approving the Agreements, each Board concluded that the terms of each
Agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the Agreements is in the
best interest of each Fund and its shareholders. In reaching this determination,
each Board considered that Management and Neuberger could be expected to provide
a high level of service to each Fund; in the case of underperforming Funds, that
it retained confidence in Management's and Neuberger's capabilities to manage
the Funds; that each Fund's fee structure appeared to each Board to be
reasonable given the quality of services expected to be provided; and that the
benefits accruing to Management and its affiliates by virtue of their
relationship to the Funds were reasonable in comparison with the costs of
providing the investment advisory services and the benefits accruing to each
Fund.

(2) None of the  services  described  in  paragraphs  (b) through (d) above were
approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01
of Regulation S-X.

(f) Hours Attributed to Other Persons
    ---------------------------------

Not applicable.

(g) Non-Audit Fees
    --------------

Non-audit  fees  billed by E&Y for  services  rendered  to the  Registrant  were
$13,700 and $14,700 for the fiscal years ended 2004 and 2005, respectively.

<PAGE>

Non-audit  fees  billed  by  E&Y  for  services  rendered  to  the  Registrant's
investment  adviser and any entity  controlling,  controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the Registrant were
$256,050 and $160,650 for 2004 and 2005, respectively.

(h) The  Audit  Committee  of the  Board of  Directors  considered  whether  the
provision of non-audit services rendered to the Registrant's  investment adviser
and any entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under  common  control with the
adviser  that  provides  ongoing  services  to  the  Registrant  that  were  not
pre-approved  by the Audit  Committee  because  the  engagement  did not  relate
directly  to  the  operations  and  financial  reporting  of the  Registrant  is
compatible with maintaining E&Y's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

The Board has  established an Audit Committee to oversee  particular  aspects of
the Registrant's  management.  The Audit Committee's purposes are (a) to oversee
the Funds' accounting and financial reporting processes,  their internal control
over financial  reporting and, as the Committee  deems  appropriate,  to inquire
into the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  of certain  third-party
service  providers;  (b) to oversee  the  quality  and  integrity  of the Funds'
financial  statements and the independent audit thereof;  (c) to oversee, or, as
appropriate,  assist Board  oversight of, the Funds'  compliance  with legal and
regulatory  requirements  that  relate to the Funds'  accounting  and  financial
reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits; (d)
to  approve  prior to  appointment  the  engagement  of the  Funds'  independent
registered public accounting firms and, in connection  therewith,  to review and
evaluate  the  qualifications,   independence  and  performance  of  the  Funds'
independent  registered public accounting firms; (e) to act as a liaison between
the Funds'  independent  registered  public accounting firms and the full Board;
and (f) to  prepare  an  audit  committee  report  as  required  by Item  306 of
Regulations S-K to be included in proxy  statements  relating to the election of
directors.  Its members are John  Cannon,  Howard A.  Mileaf,  Cornelius T. Ryan
(Chairman),  Tom D. Seip, and Peter P. Trapp.  All members are Independent  Fund
Trustees.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The  complete  schedule  of  investments  for each  series is  disclosed  in the
Registrant's Annual Report, which is included as Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board has  delegated  to  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger  Berman") the
responsibility  to vote  proxies  related to the  securities  held in the Fund's
portfolios.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by the Board to
vote proxies  related to portfolio  securities in the best interests of the Fund
and its  stockholders.  The Board  permits  Neuberger  Berman to contract with a
third party to obtain proxy voting and related services,  including  research of
current issues.

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger  Berman has voting  authority,  including the Fund. The Proxy

<PAGE>

Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman  addresses any conflicts that
may arise  between its  interests and those of its clients with respect to proxy
voting.

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Not applicable to the Registrant.

ITEM 9.  PURCHASES OF EQUITY  SECURITIES  BY  CLOSED-END  MANAGEMENT  INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS

No reportable purchases for the period covered by this report.

ITEM 10.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no changes to the  procedures  by which  shareholders  may  recommend
nominees to the Board.

<PAGE>

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)      Based on an evaluation of the  disclosure  controls and  procedures (as
         defined in rule 30a-3(c) under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as
         amended  (the "Act")) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of
         this document,  the Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Principal
         Financial and Accounting  Officer of the Registrant have concluded that
         such  disclosure  controls and procedures are  effectively  designed to
         ensure that  information  required to be disclosed by the Registrant is
         accumulated and  communicated to the  Registrant's  management to allow
         timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)      There were no significant changes in the Registrant's internal controls
         over  financial  reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d)  under the Act)
         that occurred during the  Registrant's  last fiscal half-year that have
         materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
         Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

(a)(2)   The certifications required by Rule 30a-2(a) of the Act and Section 302

(a)(3)   Not applicable to the Registrant.

of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.

filing  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 or the  Exchange  Act,  except to the

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF NEUBERGER BERMAN FUNDS

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

This code of ethics ("Code") for the registered investment companies within the
Neuberger Berman Fund complex (each, a "Company") applies to each Company's
Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is listed in Exhibit
A). The purpose of the Code is to promote:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that a Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Company;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to  an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL, POTENTIAL AND APPARENT
     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual,
potential and apparent conflicts of interest.

     An "actual conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of his or her position with the Company.

     A "potential conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest is such that it might, under certain circumstances, interfere with the
interests of the Company or the Officer's service to the Company, but those
circumstances do not now exist.


<PAGE>

     Appearances may create an "apparent conflict of interest" even when an
actual conflict does not exist. For example, an apparent conflict may exist if a
Covered Officer owns a thinly traded security that a series of a Company (a
"Fund") is buying, even if there is no actual conflict of interest.

     Certain actual or potential conflicts of interest may arise out of the
relationships between Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940
("Investment Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Company. The compliance programs and procedures of Neuberger Berman Management
Inc., Neuberger Berman, LLC (collectively referred to as the "investment
adviser") and each Company are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
of the parameters of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, actual or potential conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
contractual relationship between the Company and the investment adviser of which
the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the Company or for the investment adviser, or for both),
be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the adviser and the Company. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser and is consistent with the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Company.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Companies' Boards of
Trustees/Directors ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal interest
of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the
Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not
exhaustive.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships  improperly
         to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the

                                        2
<PAGE>

         Company,  as for  example  where  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
         personally to the detriment of the Company;

     o   cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Company;

     o   retaliate against any other Covered Officer, or any employee of a
         Company, its service providers, or the affiliated persons of any of
         them, for good faith reports of potential violations of this Code.

     There are some actual or potential conflict of interest situations that
should always be approved by the Company's Chief Legal Officer1 if material.
Covered Officers are encouraged to discuss with the Chief Legal Officer any
potential conflict the materiality of which is uncertain. Examples of reportable
conflicts include:

     o   service as a director on the board of any public or private company,
         other than the Companies, their investment adviser, and its affiliates;

     o   the  receipt of any non-nominal  gifts,  i.e., those in excess of $100;

     o   the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
         Company has current or prospective business dealings unless such
         entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
         to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
         impropriety;

     o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
         adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
         charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each Covered Officer must familiarize himself or herself with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company and the
         Company's Disclosure Controls and Procedures;

     o   each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
         to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
         outside the Company, including to the Company's trustees/directors and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

- ----------------
1    The Board of each  Company has  appointed Maxine L. Gerson as  Chief Legal
     Officer.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     o   each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
         her area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
         of the Companies and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
         accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
         documents the Companies file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
         public communications made by the Companies; and

     o   each Covered Officer should promote compliance with the standards and
         restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he or she has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
         with the requirements of the Code;

     o   report on the Company's Questionnaire for Trustees/Directors and
         Officers, where responsive to appropriate questions, all categories of
         affiliations or other relationships giving rise to actual or potential
         conflicts of interest; and

     o   notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly if he or she is aware of facts
         and circumstances that he or she knows are a violation of this Code.
         Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation.2 However, any approvals or
waivers3 sought by the Principal Executive Officer will be considered by the
Independent Trustees/ Directors of the affected Company (the "Committee").

- ----------------
2    The Chief Legal Officer is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with
     counsel to the Company and counsel to the Independent Trustees/Directors,
     and is encouraged to do so.
3    Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the registrant's failure to take action within a reasonable
     period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code
     of ethics that has been made known to an executive officer" of the
     registrant. Both waivers and implicit waivers must be disclosed publicly.


                                        4
<PAGE>

     The Companies will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any potential violations reported to him or her.

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will report to the Committee the outcome of the
         investigation, including the facts of the initial report, the scope and
         outcome of the investigation, and whether or not the Chief Legal
         Officer believes that a violation occurred.

     o   The person who initially reported the matter will be informed that the
         matter has been investigated and reported to the Committee.

     o   If the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will inform
         and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate
         action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
         applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate
         personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation
         to dismiss the Covered Officer.

     o The Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

     o   Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Companies for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Companies, the investment adviser, the Companies'
principal underwriter, or other service providers purport to apply a lesser
standard to the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Companies' and the investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and the investment
adviser's more detailed policies and procedures set forth in Neuberger Berman
Management Inc.'s Compliance Manual are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not preempted by this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
Independent Trustees/Directors.

                                        5
<PAGE>

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Company, its Board (and any
Committee of the Board) and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Companies and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
