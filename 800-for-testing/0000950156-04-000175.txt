LETTER FROM THE CEO
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Our firm was built on the strength of MFS Original Research(R), our in-depth
analysis of every security we consider for our portfolios. We've been honing
this process since 1932, when we created one of the mutual fund industry's
first research departments. And we continue to fine-tune this process so that
we can provide strong and consistent long-term investment performance to help
you achieve your financial goals.

While we have achieved strong investment performance in many of our
portfolios, our goal is to achieve the same strong results across all asset
classes. To ensure that our portfolio teams are doing the best possible job
for our firm's clients and shareholders, I am focusing the vast majority of my
time on the three key elements that I believe truly differentiate MFS from its
competitors: people, process, and culture.

PEOPLE

Our people have always been our most valuable resource. Our philosophy is to
deliver consistent, repeatable investment results by hiring the most talented
investors in our industry. We recruit from the nation's top business schools
and hire experienced analysts, both domestically and around the globe.

Our analysts are the engine that powers our entire investment team because
their recommendations have a direct impact on the investment performance of
our portfolios. To demonstrate our ongoing commitment in this area, we
increased the number of equity analysts at MFS from less than 40 at the end of
2000 to about 50 in June 2004. During that same period, we doubled the average
investment experience of our domestic equity analysts, in part by recruiting
more seasoned analysts to the firm. Moreover, our international network of
investment personnel now spans key regions of the world with offices in
London, Mexico City, Singapore, and Tokyo, as well as Boston.

One of the major advantages that MFS has over many of its competitors is that
the position of research analyst is a long-term career for many members of our
team, not simply a steppingstone toward becoming a portfolio manager. We have
worked to elevate the stature of the analyst position to be on par with that
of a portfolio manager. In fact, an exceptional research analyst has the
opportunity to earn more at MFS than some portfolio managers.

At the same time, we look within the firm to promote talented analysts who
choose a path toward becoming a portfolio manager. We rarely hire portfolio
managers from our competitors because we believe the best investors are those
steeped in the MFS process and culture. In the past few months, we have
identified three senior research analysts who will assume roles on the
management teams of several of our larger portfolios. MFS is fortunate to have
a deep bench of talented investment personnel, and we welcome the opportunity
to put their skills to work for our clients.

PROCESS

MFS was built on the strength of its bottom-up approach to researching
securities. We have enhanced the mentoring process for our research analysts
by calling on several of our most seasoned portfolio managers to supplement
the work of Director of Global Equity Research David A. Antonelli. These
portfolio managers are taking a special interest in developing the careers of
our research analysts and strengthening our investment process. Kenneth J.
Enright of our value equity group is working with a team of domestic analysts;
David E. Sette-Ducati of our small- and mid-cap equity team is working with
analysts concentrating on small- and mid-cap companies; and Barnaby Wiener of
our international equity team in London heads the European equity research
team.

We have combined the bottom-up approach of our research process with a top-
down approach to risk controls on portfolio composition. We have a very strong
quantitative team under the leadership of industry veteran Deborah H. Miller,
who represents the equity management department on the Management Committee of
the firm. Quantitative analysis helps us generate investment ideas and, more
importantly, assess the appropriate level of risk for each portfolio. The risk
assessment is designed to assure that each portfolio operates within its
investment objectives.

Additionally, we have increased the peripheral vision of our investment
personnel across asset classes through the collaboration of our Equity, Fixed
Income, Quantitative Analysis, and Risk Management teams. We recently codified
this key aspect of our culture by forming an Investment Management Committee,
composed of key members of these teams. This Committee will work to ensure
that all teams are sharing information, actively debating investment ideas,
and creating a unified investment team.

CULTURE

Teamwork is at the heart of our ability to deliver consistent and competitive
investment performance over time. At MFS, each member of our team is involved
in our success; we have no superstars. The collaborative nature of our process
works to assure a consistent investment approach across all of our products
and provides a high level of continuity in portfolio management because our
investment performance never depends on the contributions of just a single
individual. Our culture is based on an environment of teamwork that allows our
investment personnel to be successful. In turn, we demand superior investment
results from every member of our team.

We have created a meritocracy at our firm based on investment results. We hold
all of our portfolio managers accountable for the performance of their
portfolios and their contributions to the team. We also track the equity and
fixed-income ratings of our analysts so we can evaluate them based on the
performance of their recommendations. We align bonus compensation to
investment performance by weighting rewards to those who have created the
greatest long-term benefit for our shareholders and who contribute most
successfully to the Original Research(SM) process.

The strength of our culture has resulted in a tremendous amount of stability,
both in terms of people and assets under management. Although we have
dismissed members of our team whose performance did not meet MFS' high
standards, only one portfolio manager has voluntarily left the firm over the
past six months, based on a decision to retire from the industry. Similarly,
our firm's assets under management have remained quite steady in the midst of
a challenging environment.

In short, we can help you achieve your financial goals by hiring talented
people, following a disciplined process, and maintaining our firm's unique
culture. The recent enhancements described in this letter reflect the
collaborative spirit and the depth of resources in our investment teams.

As always, we appreciate your confidence in MFS and welcome any questions or
comments you may have.


    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The overall bond market was volatile during the six-month period that ended
May 31, 2004. During the late fall and winter of 2003-2004, bond prices
generally rose as various economic signals indicated that inflation in the
United States was well contained and that job growth remained weak. The
Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) seemed to respond to this environment by
suggesting that interest rates could remain low for the foreseeable future.

In the spring of 2004, however, as the period drew to a close, bond prices
reversed direction. Long-term rates climbed sharply and prices fell as evidence
of an accelerating economic recovery and stronger job growth took root, thus
suggesting, we believe, that a Fed decision to increase short-term interest
rates might be imminent. The Fed confirmed that view with its statement
following the May 4 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that it
"believes the policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to
be measured."

Against this backdrop of market volatility, yields on U.S. Treasury securities
rose modestly during the six-month period. For example, the yield on two-year
U.S. Treasury notes rose 0.50%; the yield on five-year notes went up 0.45%;
10-year rates rose 0.33%; and the 30-year bond's yield rose 0.21%.

PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION AS OF 5/31/04

QUALITY RATINGS

              Mortgage Backed                     53.4%
              U.S. Treasuries                     17.6%
              U.S. Government Agencies            12.7%
              International Sovereigns            10.7%
              Emerging Market Debt                 3.2%
              Cash and Other                       1.2%
              High Grade Corporates                1.0%
              Residential Mortgage Backed          0.2%

              Percentages based on assets as of 5/31/04.
              The portfolio is actively managed, and current
              holdings may be different.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

At net asset value (NAV), the trust outperformed its primary benchmark, the
Lehman Brothers Government/Mortgage Index. We believe our defensive interest-
rate positioning and emphasis on 10-year maturities versus longer maturities
were key factors in that outperformance. Both of these strategies were adopted
in anticipation of a tightening of interest rates by the Fed.

Returns on some of our European bond positions surpassed those of our U.S.
holdings. The relatively strong performance of our European holdings was
caused by declining yields in the European bond market, in contrast to rising
yields in the United States. In our view, low inflation and moderate economic
growth were key factors that caused rates to decline in Europe.

Relative performance also was helped by the strong performance of some of the
trust's mortgage holdings. We increased our weighting in mortgage-backed
securities in April and May of 2004 as we saw mounting evidence of an
improving economy and the potential for Fed interest rate hikes.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

While the trust's mortgage-backed securities on average were positive
contributors to performance, some of our holdings in the mortgage sector
also were detractors. Weak performance in these holdings came mainly, in our
view, as a result of higher-than-expected mortgage prepayments in the early
part of the period, when mortgage interest rates were low and refinancing
activity was still robust.

The trust underperformed its secondary benchmark, the Citigroup World
Government Non-dollar Hedged Index. During the period, the trust held less than
20% of assets in non-U.S. government bonds and therefore did not take the
fullest possible advantage of stronger performance by government debt outside
the United States.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks
relating to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic, and political
conditions.

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

Because the portfolio invests in a limited number of companies a change in
one security's value may have a more significant effect on the portfolio's
value.

Government guarantees apply to the underlying securities only and not to the
prices and yields of the portfolio.

These risks may increase share price volatility. Please see the prospectus for
further information regarding these and other risk considerations.


In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.

(S) As required, effective December 1, 2001, the trust adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
    Investment Companies and began amortizing premium on debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended November
    30, 2002 was to decrease net investment income per share by $0.02, increase net realized and unrealized gains and losses per
    share by $0.02, and decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net assets by 0.33%. Per share, ratios, and
    supplemental data for periods prior to December 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Governments Markets Income Trust (the trust) is a non-diversified
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The fund can invest in foreign securities.
Investments in foreign securities are vulnerable to the effects of changes in
the relative values of the local currency and the U.S. dollar and to the
effects of changes in each country's legal, political, and economic
environment.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) in the trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated
bid price as reported by an independent pricing service, or to the extent a
valuation is not reported by a pricing service, such securities are valued on
the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data
processing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics, and other
market data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-
the-counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more
accurately the fair value of such securities. Futures contracts are valued at
the settlement price as reported by an independent pricing service on the
primary exchange on which they are traded. Forward foreign currency contracts
are valued using spot rates and forward points as reported by an independent
pricing source. Short-term obligations with a remaining maturity in excess of
60 days will be valued upon dealer-supplied valuations. All other short-term
obligations in the trust's portfolio are valued at amortized cost, which
constitutes market value as determined by the Board of Trustees. Investment
valuations, other assets, and liabilities initially expressed in foreign
currencies are converted each business day into U.S. dollars based upon
current exchange rates. When pricing service information or market quotations
are not readily available, securities are priced at fair value as determined
under the direction of the Board of Trustees.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust
requires that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be
transferred to the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to
obtain those securities in the event of a default under the repurchase
agreement. The trust monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral
to ensure that its value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts
owed to the trust under each such repurchase agreement. The trust, along with
other affiliated entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS),
may utilize a joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or
more repurchase agreements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of
both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at
a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is
required to deposit with the broker either in cash or securities an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are
made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes
as unrealized gains or losses by the trust. The trust's investment in futures
contracts is designed to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest
or exchange rates or securities prices. Investments in interest rate futures
for purposes other than hedging may be made to modify the duration of the
portfolio without incurring the additional transaction costs involved in
buying and selling the underlying securities. Investments in currency futures
for purposes other than hedging may be made to change the trust relative
position in one or more currencies without buying and selling portfolio
assets. Investments in equity index contracts or contracts on related options
for purposes other than hedging, may be made when the trust has cash on hand
and wishes to participate in anticipated market appreciation while the cash is
being invested. Should interest or exchange rates or securities prices move
unexpectedly, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
futures contracts and may realize a loss.

SECURITY LOANS - State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), as
lending agent, may loan the securities of the trust to certain qualified
institutions (the "Borrowers") approved by the trust. The loans are
collateralized at all times by cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities in an
amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned. State
Street provide the trust with indemnification against Borrower default. The
trust bears the risk of loss with respect to the investment of cash
collateral. On loans collateralized by cash, the cash collateral is invested
in a money market fund or short-term securities. A portion of the income
generated upon investment of the collateral is remitted to the Borrowers, and
the remainder is allocated between trust and the lending agent. On loans
collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, a fee is received from the
Borrower, and is allocated between the trust and the lending agent. Income
from securities lending is included in interest income on the Statement of
Operations. The dividend and interest income earned on the securities loaned
is accounted for in the same manner as other dividend and interest income.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the
value of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The trust may enter
into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for hedging purposes as well
as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may enter into
contracts to deliver or receive foreign currency it will receive from or
require for its normal investment activities. The trust may also use contracts
in a manner intended to protect foreign currency-denominated securities from
declines in value due to unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging
purposes, the trust may enter into contracts with the intent of changing the
relative exposure of the trust's portfolio of securities to different
currencies to take advantage of anticipated changes. The forward foreign
currency exchange contracts are adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the
underlying currency and any gains or losses are recorded as unrealized until
the contract settlement date. On contract settlement date, the gains or losses
are recorded as realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions.

DOLLAR ROLL TRANSACTIONS - The trust enters into dollar roll transactions,
with respect to mortgage backed securities issued by GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC, in
which the trust sells mortgage backed securities to financial institutions and
simultaneously agrees to accept substantially similar (same type, coupon, and
maturity) securities at a later date at an agreed-upon price. The trust's
total return is enhanced through either a reduced purchase price on the buy,
or receipt of an income fee from the broker.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. All discount is accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by
federal income tax regulations. Interest payments received in additional
securities are recorded on the ex-interest date in an amount equal to the
value of the security on such date. Some securities may be purchased on a
"when-issued" or "forward delivery" basis, which means that the securities
will be delivered to the trust at a future date, usually beyond customary
settlement time.

The trust may enter in "TBA" (to be announced) purchase commitments to
purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a future date. Although the unit
price has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the principal amount of the commitments will not fluctuate more than
0.01%. The trust holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or high-
grade debt obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price, or
the trust may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other
securities it owns. Income on the securities will not be earned until
settlement date. TBA purchase commitments may be considered securities in
themselves, and involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be
purchased declines prior to settlement date, which is in addition to the risk
of decline in the value of the trusts' other assets. Unsettled TBA purchase
commitments are valued at the current market value of the underlying
securities, according to the procedures described under "Investment
Valuations" above.

Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the
value of a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal
fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer,
which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of
high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the
security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of
capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization
are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance
an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by
the trust. This amount, for the six months ended May 31, 2004, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for currency transactions, mortgage-backed securities, derivatives,
defaulted bonds, and amortization and accretion on debt securities.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended
November 30, 2003 and November 30, 2002 was as follows:

                                                11/30/03        11/30/02

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

As of November 30, 2003, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

            Capital loss carryforward                 $(24,722,985)
            ------------------------------------------------------

against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration on:

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.32%
of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of investment income.

The trust pays compensation to the Independent Trustees in the form of a
retainer, attendance fees, and compensation to Board and Committee
chairpersons, and pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are
officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of the trust, all of whom
receive remuneration for their services to the trust from MFS. Certain
officers and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors of MFS and MFS
Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded, defined benefit plan
for retired Independent Trustees and an unfunded retirement benefit deferral
plan for certain current Independent Trustees. Included in Trustees'
compensation is a net decrease of $53,882 as a result of the change in the
trust's unfunded retirement benefit deferral plan for certain current
Independent Trustees and a pension expense of $7,092 for retired Independent
Trustees for the six months ended May 31, 2004.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement between the funds and MFS, MFS is entitled to partial reimbursement
of the costs MFS incurs to provide these services, subject to review and
approval by the Board of Trustees. Each fund is allocated a portion of these
administrative costs based on its size and relative average net assets. Prior
to April 1, 2004, the trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the following
annual percentage rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

            First $2 billion                               0.0175%
            ------------------------------------------------------
            Next $2.5 billion                              0.0130%

            In excess of $7 billion                        0.0000%
            ------------------------------------------------------

Effective April 1, 2004, the trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the
following annual percentage rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

            First $2 billion                              0.01120%
            ------------------------------------------------------
            Next $2.5 billion                             0.00832%

            ------------------------------------------------------

For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the trust paid MFS $25,448, equivalent
to 0.01235% of average daily net assets, to partially reimburse MFS for the
costs of providing administrative services.

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$55,085 for the six months ended May 31, 2004. Also included in transfer agent
and dividend disbursing costs are out-of-pocket expenses, paid to MFSC, which
amounted to $11,270 for the six months ended May 31, 2004, as well as other
expenses paid to unaffiliated vendors.

number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchases by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own
shares of beneficial interest. The trust repurchased and retired 1,231,700

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit
agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is
charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the bank's
base rate plus 0.50%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average
daily, unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee
allocated to the trust for the six months ended May 31, 2004, was $1,925, and
is included in miscellaneous expense. The trust had no significant borrowings
during the six months ended May 31, 2004.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to
market risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These
financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
futures contracts. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments
represent the investment the trust has in particular classes of financial
instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject
to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is
meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

(9) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 31, 2004, MFS settled an administrative proceeding with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding disclosure of brokerage
allocation practices in connection with fund sales. Under the terms of the
settlement, in which MFS neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, MFS
agreed to pay (one dollar) $1.00 in disgorgement and $50 million in penalty to
certain MFS funds, pursuant to a plan administered by an independent
distribution consultant. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an order
of the SEC. The settlement order states that MFS failed to adequately disclose
to the Boards and Trustees and to shareholders of the MFS funds the specifics
of its preferred arrangements with certain brokerage firms selling MFS fund
shares. The settlement order states that MFS had in place policies designed to
obtain best execution of all fund trades. As part of the settlement, MFS has
retained an independent compliance consultant to review the completeness of
its disclosure to fund trustees and to fund shareholders of strategic
alliances between MFS or its affiliates and broker-dealers and other financial
advisers who support the sale of fund shares. The brokerage allocation
practices which were the subject of this proceeding were discontinued by MFS
in November 2003.

In addition, in February, 2004, MFS reached agreement with the SEC, the New
York Attorney General ("NYAG") and the Bureau of Securities Regulation of the
State of New Hampshire ("NH") to settle administrative proceedings alleging
false and misleading information in certain MFS fund prospectuses regarding
market timing and related matters (the "February Settlements"). These
regulators alleged that prospectus language for certain MFS funds was false and
misleading because, although the prospectuses for those funds in the
regulators' view indicated that the funds prohibited market timing, MFS did not
limit trading activity in 11 domestic large cap stock, high grade bond and
money market funds. MFS' former Chief Executive Officer, John W. Ballen, and
former President, Kevin R. Parke, also reached agreement with the SEC in which
they agreed to, among other terms, monetary fines and temporary suspensions
from association with any investment adviser or registered investment company.
Messrs. Ballen and Parke have resigned their positions with, and will not be
returning to, MFS and the MFS funds. Under the terms of the February
Settlements, MFS and the executives neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.

Under the terms of the February Settlements, a $225 million pool has been
established for distribution to shareholders in certain of the MFS funds
offered to retail investors ("Retail Funds"), which has been funded by MFS and
of which $50 million is characterized as a penalty. This pool will be
distributed in accordance with a methodology developed by an independent
distribution consultant in consultation with MFS and the Board of Trustees of
the Retail Funds, and acceptable to the SEC. MFS has further agreed with NYAG
to reduce its management fees in the aggregate amount of approximately $25
million annually over the next five years, and not to increase certain
management fees during this period. MFS has also paid an administrative fine
to NH in the amount of $1 million, which will be used for investor education
purposes (NH retained $250,000 and $750,000 was contributed to the North
American Securities Administrators Association's Investor Protection Trust).
In addition, under the terms of the February Settlements, MFS is in the
process of adopting certain governance changes and reviewing its policies
and procedures.

Since December 2003, MFS, Sun Life Financial Inc., various MFS funds, the
Trustees of these MFS funds, and certain officers of MFS have been named as
defendants in multiple lawsuits filed in federal and state courts. The
lawsuits variously have been commenced as class actions or individual actions
on behalf of investors who purchased, held or redeemed shares of the funds
during specified periods, as class actions on behalf of participants in
certain retirement plan accounts, or as derivative actions on behalf of the
MFS funds. The lawsuits generally allege that some or all of the defendants
(i) permitted or acquiesced in market timing and/or late trading in some of
the MFS funds, inadequately disclosed MFS' internal policies concerning market
timing and such matters, and received excessive compensation as fiduciaries to
the MFS funds, or (ii) permitted or acquiesced in the improper use of fund
assets by MFS to support the distribution of fund shares and inadequately
disclosed MFS' use of fund assets in this manner. The actions assert that some
or all of the defendants violated the federal securities laws, including the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as well as fiduciary duties and other
violations of common law. The lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages.
Insofar as any of the actions is appropriately brought derivatively on behalf
of any of the MFS funds, any recovery will inure to the benefit of the funds.
The defendants are reviewing the allegations of the multiple complaints and
will respond appropriately. Additional lawsuits based on similar allegations
may be filed in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
judgments or settlements for damages against MFS, the MFS funds, or any other
named defendant. As noted above, as part of the regulatory settlements, MFS
has established a restitution pool in the amount of $225 million to compensate
certain shareholders of the Retail Funds for damages that they allegedly
sustained as a result of market timing or late trading in certain of the
funds, and will pay $50 million to compensate certain MFS funds based upon the
amount of brokerage commissions allocated in recognition of fund sales. It is
not clear whether these amounts will be sufficient to compensate shareholders
for all of the damage they allegedly sustained, whether certain shareholders
or putative class members may have additional claims to compensation, or
whether the damages that may be awarded in any of the actions will exceed
these amounts. In the event the MFS funds incur any losses, costs or expenses
in connection with such lawsuits, the Boards of Trustees of the affected funds
may pursue claims on behalf of such funds against any party that may have
liability to the funds in respect thereof.

While these developments primarily relate to MFS' open-end funds, there can be
no assurance that these developments, or the adverse publicity associated with
these developments, will not result in an increase to the market discount of
the Trust's shares or other adverse consequences.
