LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear Shareholder:

This  annual  report  for Dreyfus Strategic Municipal Bond Fund, Inc. covers the
12-month period from December 1, 2002, through November 30, 2003. Inside, you'll
find  valuable  information  about how the fund was managed during the reporting
period, including a discussion with the fund's portfolio manager, James Welch.

Recent  reports  of  marked  improvement  in  the  growth of U.S. Gross Domestic
Product  suggest to us that the economy has started to turn the corner. Tax cuts
and  low  mortgage  rates  have put cash in consumers' pockets, and corporations
have begun to increase spending and investment. As a result, after several years
of  falling  interest  rates  and  rising bond prices, the municipal bond market
recently  has  become  more  volatile.  As  might be expected in a strengthening
economy,  securities  that  are  more sensitive to their issuers' credit quality
generally  have  outperformed  those  that  tend  to  respond more to changes in
interest rates.

Of  course,  we  have  seen  upturns before, only to be disappointed when growth
proved unsustainable over the longer term. However, based on recent data, we are
cautiously optimistic about the current economic environment. As always, we urge
you  to  speak  regularly  with  your  financial advisor, who may be in the best
position  to  suggest  the  Dreyfus  funds  designed to meet your current needs,
future goals and attitudes toward risk.

Thank you for your continued confidence and support.

Sincerely,

/s/ Stephen E. Canter

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

James Welch, Portfolio Manager

How did Dreyfus Strategic Municipal Bond Fund, Inc. perform during the period?

For  the  12-month  period  ended  November  30, 2003, the fund achieved a total
return  of 11.49%.(1) During the same period, the fund provided aggregate income
dividends  of  $0.6034 per share, which is equal to a distribution rate of
6.85%. (2)

The  fund's return was enhanced during the first half of the reporting period by
declining  interest  rates.  This  was  accomplished by our leveraging strategy,
which  enabled  the  fund to lock in at low, prevailing interest rates for up to
one  year  on  some  of the fund's auction-rate preferred securities. During the
second   half   of  the  reporting  period,  the  fund' s  move  toward  greater
diversification  and  a  shorter  average effective maturity helped it avoid the
full extent of the heightened bond market volatility.

What is the fund's investment approach?

The  fund seeks to maximize current income exempt from federal income tax to the
extent believed by Dreyfus to be consistent with the preservation of capital. In
pursuing  this  goal,  the  fund invests at least 80% of its assets in municipal
bonds.  Under  normal  market  conditions,  the weighted average maturity of the
fund' s portfolio is expected to exceed 10 years. Municipal bonds are classified
as  general  obligation  bonds,  revenue  bonds  and  notes. Under normal market
conditions,  the  fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in municipal bonds
considered investment grade or the unrated equivalent as determined by Dreyfus.

We  look for bonds that we believe can provide high current income. We strive to
find such opportunities through analysis of individual bonds' structures. Within
the  context of our bond structure analyses, we pay particularly close attention
to each bond' s maturity and early redemption features.

                                                             The Fund 3


DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED)

Over  time, many of the fund's older, higher-yielding bonds have matured or were
redeemed  by  their  issuers. We have generally attempted to replace those bonds
with  new securities that offered currently higher than average income payments.
We  have  also  sought  to upgrade the fund with newly issued bonds that, in our
opinion,   have  better  structural  or  income  characteristics  than  existing
holdings.  When such opportunities arise, we usually look to sell bonds that are
close  to  their  optimal  redemption  date or maturity. In addition, we conduct
credit  analysis  of  our  holdings in an attempt to avoid potential defaults on
interest    and    principal    payments.

What other factors influenced the fund's performance?

By the time the reporting period began, persistent economic weakness had already
led  to  low  interest  rates  and  a  sustained rally among high-quality bonds,
including most tax-exempt securities. Despite signs of stronger economic growth,
interest  rates  continued  to  fall in the winter of 2002 and spring of 2003 as
investors  looked  forward  to  another interest-rate reduction from the Federal
Reserve  Board  (the  "Fed" ). At  its meeting in late June, the Fed lowered the
federal funds rate to 1%, its lowest level since 1958.

However,  municipal  bond  prices  fell  sharply in July and early August as new
evidence  of  economic  strength emerged and investors turned their attention to
the  risk  of  higher  interest  rates,  leading to a surge of selling pressure.
Although  the  bond  market  subsequently  regained  much  of  its lost value in
September and October, it failed to recover fully by the reporting period's end.

In this more volatile environment, we moved toward a more diversified portfolio,
including  a  reduction  in the fund's holdings of lower-rated, corporate-backed
bonds  and  an  increase in higher-quality municipal securities. When making new
purchases,  we generally focused on bonds in the intermediate-term range selling
at  slight  premiums to their face values. Such bonds historically have retained
more  of  their  value  during  market  declines,  and the summer of 2003 was no
exception. During

4

this time we also reduced the fund's average effective maturity to approximately
21  years,  which  limited  the  effects  of heightened market volatility in the
summer and fall.

In  addition, the fund benefited from timely sales and purchases of bonds backed
by  proceeds from the states' settlement of litigation with the nation's tobacco
companies.  Tobacco  bonds  were hurt early in the spring after an adverse legal
ruling  against  one  of  the  largest  U.S.  tobacco companies. We subsequently
purchased a number of these bonds at what we considered to be attractive prices,
and the fund enjoyed attractive total returns during the reporting period as the
legal issues were resolved and prices of tobacco bonds rebounded.

Finally,  the  fund's leveraging strategy continued to benefit from historically
low  borrowing  rates.  In  November,  we extended the term of one of the fund's
issues  of auction-rate preferred securities to one year, effectively locking in
low borrowing rates through most of 2004.

What is the fund's current strategy?

We   have   maintained   the  fund' s  focus  on  premium-coupon  bonds  in  the
intermediate-term  range.  Because yield differences in this range currently are
relatively  steep,  we believe that they can be potentially beneficial over time
as  they  move  closer  to  their  final  maturities. In our judgment, these are
prudent  strategies  while  investors  continue to adjust to a stronger economic
environment.

                                                             The Fund 21

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1--Significant Accounting Policies:

Dreyfus Strategic Municipal Bond Fund, Inc. (the "fund") is registered under the
Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end  management investment company. The fund's investment objective is to
maximize current income exempt from federal income tax to the extent believed by
the fund's investment adviser to be consistent with the preservation of capital.
The  Dreyfus Corporation ("Dreyfus") serves as the fund's investment adviser and
administrator.  Dreyfus is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon Bank, N.A., which
is  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon"). Boston
Safe  Deposit  and Trust Company (the "Custodian") acts as the fund's custodian.
The  Custodian is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon. PFPC Global Fund Services
("PFPC"), a subsidiary of PNC Bank ("PNC"), serves as the fund's transfer agent,
dividend-paying  agent, registrar and plan agent. The fund's Common Stock trades
on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DSM.

The  fund  has outstanding 2,480 shares of Series A, Series B and Series C for a
total  of  7,440  shares  of Auction Preferred Stock ("APS"), with a liquidation
preference  of $25,000 per share (plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid
dividends  upon  liquidation) . APS  dividend  rates  are determined pursuant to
periodic auctions. Deutsche Bank, as Auction Agent, receives a fee from the fund
for  its  services  in  connection with such auctions. The fund also compensates
broker-dealers  generally at an annual rate of .25% of the purchase price of the
shares of APS placed by the broker-dealer in an auction.

The  fund  is  subject  to  certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply  with  these  restrictions  could  preclude  the  fund from declaring any
distributions  to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The  holders  of the APS, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect at
least  two directors. The holders of the APS vote as a separate class on certain
other matters, as required by law. The fund has desig-

22

nated  Robin  A. Pringle and John E. Zuccotti to represent holders of APS on the
fund's Board of Directors.

The  fund' s  financial  statements  are  prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which may require the use of
management  estimates  and  assumptions.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(A)  PORTFOLIO  VALUATION:  Investments  in municipal debt securities (excluding
options  and  financial  futures  on municipal and U.S. Treasury securities) are
valued on the last business day of each week and month by an independent pricing
service  (the  "Service" ) approved  by  the Board of Directors. Investments for
which  quoted bid prices are readily available and are representative of the bid
side of the market in the judgment of the Service are valued at the mean between
the  quoted  bid  prices  (as  obtained  by  the  Service  from  dealers in such
securities)  and  asked  prices  (as  calculated  by  the Service based upon its
evaluation  of  the  market  for  such  securities) . Other  investments  (which
constitute  a majority of the portfolio securities) are carried at fair value as
determined  by  the  Service,  based  on methods which include consideration of:
yields or prices of municipal securities of comparable quality, coupon, maturity
and  type; indications as to values from dealers; and general market conditions.
Options  and  financial  futures  on  municipal  securities  and  U.S.  Treasury
securities  are  valued  at  the  last sales price on the securities exchange on
which  such  securities  are  primarily traded or at the last sales price on the
national  securities  market  on  the  last business day of each week and month.

(B)  SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
recorded  on  a  trade  date  basis.  Realized  gain  and  loss  from securities
transactions  are  recorded  on  the  identified  cost  basis.  Interest income,
adjusted for amortization of discount and premium on investments, is earned from
settlement  date  and  recognized  on the accrual basis. Securities purchased or
sold  on  a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be settled a month or more
after the trade date.

                                                             The Fund 23

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(C)  DIVIDENDS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS  OF  COMMON  STOCK  (" COMMON SHAREHOLDER(S)"):
Dividends  are  recorded  on  the  ex-dividend  date.  Dividends from investment
income-net  are  declared  and paid monthly. Dividends from net realized capital
gain,  if  any,  are normally declared and paid at least annually. To the extent
that  net  realized capital gain can be offset by capital loss carryovers, it is
the policy of the fund not to distribute such gain.

For  Common  Shareholders who elect to receive their distributions in additional
shares  of  the  fund, in lieu of cash, such distributions will be reinvested at
the  lower  of  the market price or net asset value per share (but not less than
95% of the market price) as defined in the dividend reinvestment plan.

On  November 26, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend to Common
Shareholders  of $.051 per share from investment income-net, payable on December
26,  2003  to  Common  Shareholders  of  record  as  of the close of business on
December 11, 2003.

(D)  DIVIDENDS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS  OF APS: For APS, dividends are currently reset
annually for Series A and B and every 7 days for series C. The dividend rates in
effect  at  November 30, 2003 were as follows: Series A --1.55%, Series B--1.25%
and Series C--.95%.

(E) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the policy of the fund to continue to qualify as
a  regulated  investment  company, which can distribute tax exempt dividends, by
complying with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as
amended,  and  to  make  distributions  of  income and net realized capital gain
sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income and excise taxes.

At November 30, 2003, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis were
as  follows:  undistributed  tax  exempt  income $5,652,357, accumulated capital
losses $24,677,297 and unrealized appreciation $12,596,664.

24

The accumulated capital loss carryover is available to be applied against future
net securities profits, if any, realized subsequent to November 30, 2003. If not
applied,  $3,964,163 of the carryover expires in fiscal 2007, $5,542,712 expires
in  fiscal  2008,  $442,201 expires in fiscal 2009, $9,253,314 expires in fiscal
2010 and $5,474,907 expires in fiscal 2011.

The  tax  character  of  distributions  paid  to  shareholders during the fiscal
periods  ended  November  30,  2003 and November 30, 2002, respectively, were as
follows: tax exempt income of $31,669,641 and $30,331,952.

During  the period ended November 30, 2003, as a result of permanent book to tax
differences,  the fund decreased accumulated undistributed investment income-net
by  $70,359, increased net realized gain (loss) on investments by $9,360,898 and
decreased  paid-in  capital  by $9,290,539. Net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

NOTE 2--Bank Line of Credit:

The  fund  participates  with  other  Dreyfus-managed  funds  in  a $100 million
unsecured  line  of  credit  primarily to be utilized for temporary or emergency
purposes.  Interest  is  charged to the fund based on prevailing market rates in
effect at the time of borrowings. During the period ended November 30, 2003, the
fund did not borrow under the line of credit.

NOTE 3--Investment Advisory Fee, Administration Fee and Other Transactions With
Affiliates:

(A)  The  fee  payable  by the fund, pursuant to the provisions of an Investment
Advisory  Agreement  with Dreyfus, is payable monthly based on an annual rate of
.. 50  of  1% of the value of the fund's average weekly net assets. The fund also
has  an  Administration  Agreement  with  Dreyfus,  a Custody Agreement with the
Custodian and a Transfer Agency and Registrar Agreement with PFPC. The fund pays
in the aggregate for administration, custody and transfer agency services a

                                                                The Fund 25

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

monthly  fee  based  on  an  annual rate of .25 of 1% of the value of the fund's
average  weekly  net  assets; out-of pocket transfer agency and custody expenses
are paid separately by the fund.

(B)  Each  Board  member also serves as a Board member of other funds within the
Dreyfus complex. Effective January 27, 2003, annual retainer fees and attendance
fees  are allocated to each fund based on net assets. Prior to January 27, 2003,
each  director who is not an "affiliated person" as defined in the Act, received
from  the fund an annual fee of $2,500 and an attendance fee of $500 per meeting
for  services  to the fund. The Chairman of the Board received an additional 25%
of  such  compensation  and  continues  to  do  so  under  the  new compensation
structure.

NOTE 4--Securities Transactions:

The  aggregate amount of purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term  securities,  during  the period ended November 30, 2003, amounted to
$472,508,605 and $461,019,789, respectively.

At  November  30,  2003, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes
was  $600,911,334;  accordingly,  accumulated  net  unrealized  appreciation  on
investments   was   $12,596,664,  consisting  of  $32,614,082  gross  unrealized
appreciation and $20,017,418 gross unrealized depreciation.

verification  by  examination of securities held by the custodian as of November
30,   2003  and  confirmation  of  securities  not  held  by  the  custodian  by

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION (Unaudited)

In accordance with federal tax law, the fund hereby designates all the dividends
paid  from  investment income-net during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2003
as  "exempt-interest dividends" (not generally subject to regular federal income

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

Under  the  fund' s  Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), a holder of Common
Stock  (" Common  Shareholder" ) who has fund shares registered in his name will
have  all  dividends  and  distributions reinvested automatically by PFPC Global
Fund  Services, as Plan agent (the "Agent"), in additional shares of the fund at
the  lower  of prevailing market price or net asset value (but not less than 95%
of  market value at the time of valuation) unless such Common Shareholder elects
to  receive  cash  as provided below. If market price is equal to or exceeds net
asset  value,  shares  will  be  issued  at  net asset value. If net asset value
exceeds market price or if a dividend or other distribution payable only in cash
is declared, the Agent, as agent for the Plan participants, will buy fund shares
in  the  open  market. A Plan participant is not relieved of any income tax that
may be payable on such dividends or distributions.

A  Common  Shareholder  who  owns  fund  shares  registered  in  the name of his
broker/dealer  or  other nominee (i.e., in "street name") may not participate in
the  Plan,  but may elect to have cash dividends and distributions reinvested by
his  broker/dealer  or  other  nominee  in additional shares of the fund if such
service  is  provided  by  the  broker/dealer  or  other nominee; otherwise such
dividends  and  distributions  will  be  treated like any other cash dividend or
distribution.

A  Common  Shareholder  who  has fund shares registered in his name may elect to
withdraw  from the Plan at any time for a $5.00 fee and thereby elect to receive
cash  in lieu of shares of the fund. Changes in elections must be by direct mail
to PFPC Global Fund Services, Attention: Closed-End funds, Post Office Box 8030,
Boston,  Massachusetts  02266,  or  by  telephone  at 1-800-331-1710, and should
include  the  shareholder' s  name  and  address  as  they appear on the Agent's
records.  Elections  received  by  the  Agent will be effective only if received
prior to the record date for any distribution.

The  Agent  maintains  all Common Shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written  confirmations of all transactions in the account. Shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the

                                                                The Fund 29

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (CONTINUED)

Agent  in  non-certificated  form  in the name of the participant, and each such
participant's proxy will include those shares purchased pursuant to the Plan.

The  fund  pays the Agent's fee for reinvestment of dividends and distributions.
Plan  participants  pay  a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment
of dividends or distributions.

The  fund  reserves  the  right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change sent to
Plan  participants  at least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or
distribution.  The  Plan  also  may  be amended or terminated by the Agent on at
least 90 days' written notice to Plan participants.

MANAGED DIVIDEND POLICY

The  fund' s  dividend  policy  is  to  distribute  substantially all of its net
investment  income  to  its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more consistent yield to the current trading price of shares
of  Common Stock of the fund, the fund may at times pay out less than the entire
amount  of net investment income earned in any particular month and may at times
in  any  month  pay out such accumulated but undistributed income in addition to
net  investment  income earned in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by
the  fund  for  any  particular month may be more or less than the amount of net
investment  income  earned  by  the  fund  during such month. The fund's current
accumulated but undistributed net investment income, if any, is disclosed in the
Statement  of  Assets  and  Liabilities,  which  comprises part of the Financial
Information included in this report.

BENEFITS AND RISKS OF LEVERAGING

The  fund  utilizes leverage to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value of
its  Common  Stock.  These  objectives  cannot  be achieved in all interest rate
environments. To leverage, the fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends
at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests

30

the  proceeds  in  long-term  municipal  bonds.  The  interest  earned  on these
investments  is  paid  to  Common Shareholders in the form of dividends, and the
value  of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the per share net asset value
of  the  fund's Common Stock. In order to benefit Common Shareholders, the yield
curve  must  be  positively  sloped:  that is, short-term interest rates must be
lower  than  long-term  interest  rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining  interest  rates  will benefit Common Shareholders. If either of these
conditions  change,  then  the  risk  of  leveraging  will begin to outweigh the
benefits.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

During  the period ended November 30, 2003, shareholders approved changes in the
fund' s  fundamental  investment  policies  to permit the fund to engage in swap
transactions  and  to  permit  the fund to invest in other investment companies.
Otherwise,  during the period, there were: (i) no material changes in the fund's
investment  objectives  or  policies,  (ii)  no changes in the fund's charter or
by-laws  that  would  delay or prevent a change of control of the fund, (iii) no
material changes in the principal risk factors associated with investment in the
fund, and (iv) no changes in the person primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the fund's portfolio.

                                                             The Fund 31

                                 THE DREYFUS FAMILY OF FUNDS
                            CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                                AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



1.      Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

      This code of ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
complex (each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or Controller, or
other persons performing similar functions, each of whom is listed on Exhibit A
(the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
      apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
      relationships;

o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
      documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities and
      Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications made by
      the Fund;

o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
      person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

      2. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts
of Interest


      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of the Fund and the Fund's
investment adviser (the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or identify and
correct, violations of these provisions. The Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and the circumstances they
cover fall outside of the parameters of the Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), will be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board that
the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes of ethics.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that
the Code cannot enumerate every possible scenario. The overarching principle of
the Code is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

      Each Covered Officer must:

o     not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund whereby
      the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

o     not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
      of the Fund; and

o     not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
      potential violations that are made in good faith.

      3. Disclosure and Compliance

o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
      requirements generally applicable to the Fund within his area of
      responsibility;

o     each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
      misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or outside
      the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members and auditors, and to
      governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations; and

o     each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
      responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and
      the Adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
      understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
      with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
      the Fund; and

o     it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
      with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
      regulations.

      4. Reporting and Accountability

      Each Covered Officer must:

o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
      read, and understands the Code;

o     annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
      requirements of the Code; and

o     notify the Adviser's General Counsel (the "General Counsel") promptly if
      he knows of any violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a
      violation of the Code.

      The General Counsel is responsible for applying the Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by any
Covered Officer will be considered by the Fund's Board.

      The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing the
Code:

o     the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
      potential violations reported to him;

o     if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
      violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any
      further action;

o     any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
      reported to the Board;

o     if the Board concurs that a violation has occurred, it will consider
      appropriate action, which may include: review of, and appropriate
      modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
      appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board; or dismissal of the
      Covered Officer;

o     the Board will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

o     any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required, will be
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

      5. Other Policies and Procedures

      The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. The Fund's, its
principal underwriter's and the Adviser's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under
the Investment Company Act and the Adviser's additional policies and procedures,
including its Code of Conduct, are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

      6. Amendments

      The Code may not be amended except in written form which is specifically
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Fund's Board, including a
majority of independent Board members.

      7. Confidentiality

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds and their counsel, the
appropriate Boards (or Committees) and their counsel and the Adviser.

      8. Internal Use

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
