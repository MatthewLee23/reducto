TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:

We are happy to present to you our report for the year ended October 31, 2003,
which we believe contains complete and pertinent financial information.

After two traumatic years, most world stock markets have made dramatic rebounds
from their cyclical bottoms.

We are pleased to inform you that over the past fiscal year BMC Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") is up 19%. The Fund's strong performance reinforces the Board's
long-term strategy to remain well diversified across asset categories. By
maintaining a significant exposure to stocks when they became very unpopular,
the Fund's overall asset value increased substantially as equity prices rose.

For the latest fiscal year, earnings including unrealized gains grew to
$23,247,017, which represents an 18.5% increase. Obviously, we cannot expect
comparable earnings during the year which will end October 31, 2004, as markets
are volatile; however, we are reasonably optimistic that barring an unexpected
national or international event the financial markets will continue to improve.

BMC Fund, Inc. became a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) on April 1, 1981.
During the year ended October 31, 2003 the Fund paid the following dividends per
share:

    December 10, 2002 to shareholders of record November 25, 2002      $  .25
    March 10, 2003 to shareholders of record February 25, 2003            .25
    June 10, 2003 to shareholders of record May 25, 2003                  .25
    September 10, 2003 to shareholders of record August 25, 2003          .25
                                                                       ------

    Total                                                              $ 1.00
                                                                       ======

The Fund paid a dividend of $.38 per share on December 10, 2003 to shareholders
of record November 25, 2002.

Schedule I is a listing of all the Fund's diversified securities at October 31,
2003, with a total market value of $127,056,406.

It is our intent to render reports to shareholders each six months.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of BMC Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of BMC
Fund, Inc. (the "Company"), including the schedules of investments, as of
October 31, 2003, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the year ended October 31,
2003 and the seven months ended October 31, 2002, and the financial highlights
for the year ended October 31, 2003, the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and
the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits. The financial highlights for each of
the seven years in the period ended March 31, 2000 were audited by other
auditors whose report dated May 19, 2000 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
financial highlights for those seven years.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and the financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2003 and
the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and the financial highlights for the
year ended October 31, 2003, the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and the
years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of BMC Fund, Inc. as of October 31,
2003, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its
net assets for the year ended October 31, 2003 and the seven months ended
October 31, 2002, and the financial highlights for the year ended October 31,
2003, the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and the years ended March 31, 2002
and 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year Ended October 31, 2003
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company") is a closed-end, diversified investment
      company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
      Prior to becoming a regulated investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
      Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary
      of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the
      preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity
      with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies.

      A.    Investment Valuations - The investment securities are stated at
            market value as determined by closing prices on national securities
            exchanges. Investment securities include corporate bonds, mutual
            funds, and common and preferred stocks.

            The investments in limited partnerships, other investments and
            venture capital are stated at estimated fair value as determined by
            the management of these investments and are approved by the
            Company's Valuation Committee after giving consideration to
            historical and projected financial results, economic conditions,
            financial condition of investee and other factors and events subject
            to change. Because of the inherent uncertainty of those valuations,
            the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that
            would have been used had a ready market value for the securities
            existed, and these differences could be material.

            The carrying value of the investments in wholly owned subsidiaries
            is based on an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the
            subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of the wholly owned subsidiaries in
            the statement of operations represents the current year earnings of
            the subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method.

            The carrying value of the investment in real estate is based on an
            independent appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate.

      B.    Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for
            on the date the order to buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
            losses on investments are determined on the basis of specific
            identification of issues sold or matured.

      C.    Income Taxes - No federal tax provision is required as it is the
            Company's policy to comply with the provisions of Subchapter M of
            the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the
            distribution to its shareholders of substantially all of its income
            and any capital gains not offset by capital losses. Also, no state
            income tax provision has been provided because the states in which
            the Company has income recognize the tax exempt status of a
            regulated investment company.

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

      D.    Dividend Policy - It is the Company's policy to pay dividends during
            the year in sufficient amounts to meet the requirements to maintain
            its status as a regulated investment company.

      E.    Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of financial
            reporting, the Company considers all investments at financial
            institutions with original maturities of three months or less to be
            equivalent to cash. Short-term money market investments managed by
            third party investors are included in investment securities.

      F.    Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States of America requires management to make estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
            liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
            revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
            could differ from those estimates.

2.    LINE OF CREDIT

      On September 25, 2000 (modified on October 20, 2000 and renewed October
      14, 2003), the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for an
      unsecured line of credit in the amount of $10,000,000 to provide the
      Company more flexibility in its payment of dividends and management of its
      investments. The interest rate on any borrowings will be at the LIBOR
      market index rate plus 125 basis points. No commitment fee is charged on
      any unused balance. As of October 31, 2003, the Company had borrowings of
      $10,000,000 from this line of credit, which expires on July 31, 2004

3.    ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS

      The Company does not have an advisory board. The independent directors are
      paid an annual fee of $3,000 plus $1,000 for each meeting attended. Each
      such independent director is paid an additional $1,000 for each day
      attending a committee meeting other than on the date of a board meeting.
      In addition, all directors are reimbursed for their reasonable expenses
      incurred in attending meetings.

4.    CHANGE OF FISCAL YEAR

      The Company changed its fiscal year from March 31 to October 31, beginning
      with the seven month period ending October 31, 2002. The change was made
      to facilitate the annual calculation of capital gains that must be paid by
      each December 31 for the preceding twelve month period ending October 31.

officer, and principal accounting officer or controller (individually, a
"Senior Financial Officer" and collectively, the "Senior Financial Officers")
of BMC Fund, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the "Company").  Its purpose
is to promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with the law,
particularly as related to the maintenance of the Company's financial
records and the preparation of financial statements filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The obligations of this Code of
Ethics supplement, but do not replace, the Company's Code of Ethics
applicable to all Access Persons.

1. Senior Financial Officers are expected to carry out their responsibilities
honestly and with integrity, exercising at all times their best independent
judgment.

2. Senior Financial Officers must avoid situations in which their
own interests conflict, or may appear to conflict, with the
interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise when a
Senior Financial Officer takes actions or has interests that may
make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when a Senior
Financial Officer, or a member of his or her family, receives
improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position
in the Company. In any case in which a Senior Financial Officer
finds himself or herself with an actual or apparent material
conflict of interest, he or she must promptly disclose it to
the Chairman of the Audit Committee so that the Audit Committee
may review the transaction or relationship.  The Audit Committee
will have final authority to determine how the situation should be resolved.
In furtherance of the above, no Senior Financial Officer
may:
(a) Work for, or receive payments for services or accept gifts of
more than a nominal value from, any investment adviser or other provider of
services to the Company or from any of the Company's portfolio companies.
(b) Serve on the board of directors or a similar body for an outside company
or government agency, other than a non-profit or community organization,
without the approval of the Audit Committee.
(c) Provide a gift to any person or entity that would violate any
law.

3. Senior Financial Officers are responsible for assuring full,
fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure of relevant
financial information to shareholders and investors. In particular
they are responsible for assuring that the Company complies with
SEC rules governing disclosure of financial information. Among
other things, Senior Financial Officers shall:
(a) Establish and maintain internal controls and procedures and
disclosure controls and procedures designed to assure that
financial information is recorded, processed and transmitted to
those responsible for preparing periodic reports and other public
communications containing financial information so that they are
complete, accurate, and timely.
(b) Oversee the appropriate personnel to help ensure that the
internal controls and procedures and disclosure controls and
procedures are being followed.
(c) Carefully review each periodic report for accuracy and
completeness before it is filed with the SEC and carefully review
each public communication containing financial information before
it is released.
(d) Promptly disclose to the Audit Committee and the Company's
independent auditors any material weaknesses in, or concerns
regarding, the Company's disclosure controls or internal controls.
(e) Never create or maintain secret or unrecorded funds, assets, or
accounts, or intentionally make a payment or approve an invoice,
expense report or other document that is incorrect, misleading or
inaccurate.
(f) Comply at all times with applicable governmental laws, rules
and regulations.

4. Senior Financial Officers are responsible for promptly bringing
to the attention of the Audit Committee or the full Board of
Directors:
(a) Any matters that could compromise the integrity of the Company's
financial reports;
(b) Any disagreement with respect to any material accounting matter; and
(c) Any violation of this Code of Ethics or of any law or
regulation related to the Company's accounting or financial affairs.

5. No Senior Financial Officer may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,
harass, or in any other manner discriminate against
an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of
any lawful act done by the employee (1) to provide information,
cause information to be provided or otherwise assist in an investigation
regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes
a violation of law, including any rule or regulation of the SEC, or any
provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders; (2) to file,
cause to be filed, testify, participate in, or otherwise assist in a proceeding
filed or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the employer) relating
to an alleged violation of law, including any rule or regulation of
the SEC, or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against
shareholders; or (3) to make any report pursuant to the Company's
Procedures for Reporting Complaints About Accounting and Auditing Matters.

6. The Audit Committee shall approve any waiver or amendment of this
Code of Ethics, and any such waiver or amendment shall be disclosed
promptly, as required by law or SEC regulation.

7. A failure by any Senior Financial Officer to comply with the
laws or regulations governing the Company's business, this Code
of Ethics or any other Company policy or requirement may result
in disciplinary action, including termination, and, if warranted,
legal proceedings. The Audit Committee will investigate violations
and appropriate action will be taken in the event of any violations
of this Code of Ethics.

Adopted:  July 26, 2003

Exhibit 10(a)(3)

BMC FUND, INC.
PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") invests in voting securities of a variety
of portfolio companies in order to achieve the Fund's investment objective
of providing a maximum level of income for shareholders consistent with
maintaining the Fund's long-term purchasing power.  The Fund's Board
of Directors, acting on behalf of the Fund, has the right, and
the obligation, to vote proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio
securities.  The Board has delegated to the Investment
Committee and the Treasurer proxy voting authority, subject to the
Board's continuing oversight.  In discharging this authority, the
Investment Committee and the Treasurer must act in a manner that
is consistent with the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders.

The following policies will govern the Investment Committee's
and the Treasurer's voting of proxies relating to the Fund's
portfolio securities:

General Policies

1. Delegation of Proxy Voting Decisions:  The Fund will not
delegate proxy voting decisions to any third party, including its
external investment advisers.  Proxy voting decisions will be made
on behalf of the Fund by the Investment Committee or
by the Treasurer of the Fund in accordance with the Investment
Committee's direction.  The Investment Committee or Treasurer
may consider, to the extent deemed appropriate,  recommendations
of nationally recognized institutional shareholder representative
groups, such as Institutional Shareholder Services, in determining
how to vote proxies.

The Investment Committee will instruct the Treasurer how to vote
proxies with respect to securities acquired on behalf of the Fund
by an external investment adviser without consultation with such
adviser.  The Investment Committee will instruct the Treasurer
how to vote proxies with respect to securities acquired on behalf
of the Fund by an internal portfolio manager after consultation
with such portfolio manager.  Notwithstanding the above, the Treasurer
may vote proxies in favor of the recommendation of the board of
directors of a portfolio company with respect to the election of
directors and the appointment or ratification of auditors
without specific instruction from the Investment Committee.

2. Matters Affecting Shareholder Rights.   If a portfolio company
submits to its shareholders a matter that, in the view of the
Investment Committee, adversely affects the rights of the portfolio
company's shareholders as a whole, the Investment Committee will
cause the proxy to be voted against the proposal.  If the Fund's
ownership of the portfolio securities represents more than five
percent of the portfolio company's outstanding voting securities,
the Investment Committee will notify the portfolio company's
management of the Fund's opposition to the proposal and encourage
the portfolio company to withdraw the proposal.

3. Consideration of Views of Management of Portfolio Company.  Except as
otherwise provided in this Policy, in considering how to vote a proxy
relating to a portfolio security, the Investment Committee will generally
defer to the views of management of the portfolio company if the portfolio
security has performed in accordance with the Fund's expectations
(taking into account not only the performance of the portfolio company
but also industry and economic factors over which the portfolio company
has no control).

4. Conflicts with Affiliated Persons.  If a matter submitted to a vote of
the shareholders of a portfolio company presents a conflict between the
interests of the Fund's shareholders and the interests of any affiliated
person or investment adviser of the Fund, the Investment Committee will
cause the proxy relating to the portfolio security to be voted in
accordance with the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders as
a whole, without consideration of the interests of the affiliated person
or investment adviser.  If the affiliated person of the Fund whose
interests conflict with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
is a member of the Investment Committee, such person will recuse himself
or herself from the Investment Committee's consideration of the matter.

5. General Principle:  The most important factor to be considered by the
Investment Committee in evaluating how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities is the financial impact of the matter on the Fund's
investment.  The Investment Committee may also take into account
non-financial considerations, including those described in the Global S
ullivan Principles of Corporate Social Responsibility, but such factors
are secondary to financial considerations.

Specific Policies

The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will cause a proxy to be voted
against, or cause the Fund's authority to vote in favor to be withheld,
for the following issues when submitted to a shareholder vote:

1. Classified Boards.  The Fund believes that it is in the best interests
of the Fund and its shareholders for portfolio companies to be able to
elect a full slate of directors at each annual meeting.

2. Dual Class Capitalization. The Fund believes that it is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders for portfolio companies to
oppose capital structures that diminish the rights of the Fund's voting
shares.

3. Golden Parachutes.  The Fund believes that it is in the best interests
of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose proposals that
would grant excessive awards to employees in the event of termination of
employment following a change in control.

4. Blank Check Preferred Stock.  The Fund believes that it is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose blank
check preferred stock proposals, because this type of preferred stock
gives the company's board of directors discretionary authority over voting,
conversion, dividend and other rights at the time the stock is issued and is
susceptible to abuse.  The Fund might vote in favor of this provision if
the company's board provides assurances that this provision would not be
used without advance shareholder approval in a change in control situation
or that the voting rights of a series of preferred stock are limited to one
vote per share.

5. Re-pricing of Outstanding Options.  The Fund believes that it is in
the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to
oppose excessive re-pricing of outstanding options for officers and
directors, because doing so usually would be inconsistent with the
incentive nature of the stock option plan as originally adopted and
could result in unfair dilution of the Fund's investment in the company.

6. Supermajority Voting.  The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will
vote against supermajority voting provisions because the Fund believes
that a simple majority provides shareholders with a better means to
effect change.

The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote for the following
issues when submitted to a shareholder vote:

1. Adoption or Extension of Shareholder Rights Plans.  The Treasurer,
on behalf of the Fund, will vote for shareholder rights plans if
shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on the plan and the
plan is subject to a limited term and is tied to an overall corporate
strategy.

2. Stock-based Compensation Plans.   The Treasurer, on behalf of the
Fund, will vote for stock-based compensation plans because the Fund
believes in providing appropriate equity incentives to corporate
employees for increasing shareholder value.  The Treasurer will
analyze each plan approval or plan amendment to be sure that the
stock-related compensation plan aligns the interests of corporate
management with those of the shareholders.

3. Increases in Authorized Common Stock.  The Treasurer, on behalf
of the Fund, will vote for increases in authorized common stock as
long as the increase is reasonable under the circumstances.

4. Confidential Voting.  The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will
vote for confidential voting proposals because the Fund believes
that shareholders should have the right to vote in private, thus
enabling them to maintain their independence and, in the case of
employee shareholders, to vote without fear of retribution.

Disclosure of Voting Policies

These Policies are available to shareholders of the Fund without
charge, upon request, by calling the Secretary of the Fund
(collect at 828-758-6100, extension 22).  The Fund will mail a
copy of these Policies by first class mail to any shareholder
requesting a copy within three business days after the request
is made.  The Policies will also be available on the Securities
and Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov).
