A Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder

Financial markets embarked on a wild ride during the August reporting period.
Subprime mortgage troubles intensified in the final months of the period,
spawning a widespread credit and liquidity crisis that crept into other areas of
the market. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) and other countries'
central banks stepped in to inject liquidity into the markets and bolster
investor confidence. In August, the Fed cut the discount rate, the rate charged
to banks to borrow money directly from the Fed, from 6.25% to 5.75%. Another
..50% cut in the discount rate came on September 18, along with a .50% cut in the
more widely followed federal funds rate. This brought the target short-term
interest rate, which had remained unchanged at 5.25% for over a year, to 4.75%.

Although heightened volatility has been a recurring theme throughout the past
year, the global economy (excluding the U.S. housing market) remained quite
healthy. In general, equity market fundamentals also held firm -- second-quarter
corporate earnings exceeded expectations (although future earnings could be at
risk if the economy weakens), dividend payouts and share buybacks continued to
grow, and valuations remained attractive. These tailwinds generally prevailed
over such headwinds as a slowing U.S. economy and troubled housing market,
although the more recent credit crunch dampened corporate merger-and-acquisition
activity, a key source of strength for equity markets. Stocks recorded their
second-worst day of the year in August, yet remained comfortably in the black
year-to-date.

Meanwhile, mixed economic signals and the credit market debacle made for a
volatile backdrop for fixed income, with investors fleeing from bonds associated
with the housing and credit markets in favor of higher-quality Treasury issues.
As a result, the 10-year Treasury yield, which touched 5.30% in June (its
highest level in five years), fell to 4.54% by period-end, while prices
correspondingly rose.

Against this backdrop, financial markets posted mixed results for the six- and
12-month periods ended August 31, 2007:

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield
and net asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be
achieved in all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues
Preferred Stock, which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates,
and invests the proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on
these investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock
shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings
is reflected in the per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock.
However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be
positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than
long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally declining
interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of these
conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh the
benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As of August 31, 2007, the Fund's leverage amount, due to Auction Market
Preferred Stock, was 36.58% of total net assets, before the deduction of
Preferred Stock.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. See Note 1(c) to Financial Statements for details of
municipal bonds held in trust.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may invest in swap agreements, which are over- the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party
with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to
pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations
to pay the other party to the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol MVF. The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price
in the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general direction
of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures contracts
and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing
prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are
valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In the
case of options traded in the OTC market, valuation is the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements are
valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Fund's pricing service.
Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at their net asset value
each business day. Securities and other assets for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or
under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Such valuations and
procedures will be reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract due to an
unfavorable change in the price of the underlying security or index, or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract. The counterparty for certain
instruments may pledge cash or securities as collateral.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such financial futures contracts.
      Financial futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of
      securities at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield.
      Upon entering into a contract, the Fund deposits and maintains as
      collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the
      transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
      receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
      fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
      as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
      losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time
      it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call options and purchase call and
      put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the
      premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent
      liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked-to-market
      reflecting the current market value of the option written. When a security
      is purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the related premium
      paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from) the basis of the
      security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds of the
      security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a closing
      transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent
      of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost
      of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.

<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts
      in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments
      on a specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set
      period of time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The
      net periodic payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate;
      the change in market value of a specified security, basket of securities,
      or index; or the return generated by a security. These periodic payments
      received or made by the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of
      Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are
      also realized upon termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are
      marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements.

(c) Municipal bonds held in trust -- The Fund invests in leveraged residual
certificates ("TOB Residuals") issued by tender option bond trusts ("TOBs"). A
TOB is established by a third party sponsor forming a special purpose entity,
into which the Fund, or an agent on behalf of the Fund, transfers municipal
securities. A TOB typically issues two classes of beneficial interests:
short-term floating rate certificates, which are sold to third party investors,
and residual certificates, which are generally issued to the Fund which made the
transfer or to affiliates of the Fund. The transfer of the municipal securities
to a TOB does not qualify for sale treatment under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," therefore the municipal
securities deposited into a TOB are presented in the Fund's schedule of
investments and the proceeds from the transaction are reported as a liability
for trust certificates of the Fund. Similarly, proceeds from residual
certificates issued to affiliates, if any, from the transaction are included in
the liability for trust certificates. Interest income from the underlying
security is recorded by the Fund on an accrual basis. Interest expense incurred
on the secured borrowing and other expenses related to remarketing,
administration and trustee services to a TOB are reported as expenses of the
Fund. The floating rate certificates have interest rates that generally reset
weekly and their holders have the option to tender certificates to the TOB for
redemption at par at each reset date. The residual interests held by the Fund
include the right of the Fund (1) to cause the holders of a proportional share
of the floating rate certificates to tender their certificates at par, and (2)
to transfer a corresponding share of the municipal securities from the TOB to
the Fund. At August 31, 2007, the aggregate value of the underlying municipal
securities transferred to TOBs was $204,629,901, the related liability for trust
certificates was $97,603,890 and the range of interest rates on the liability
for trust certificates was 3.682% to 3.734%.

Financial transactions executed through TOBs generally will underperform the
market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment, but
tend to outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates decline
or remain relatively stable. Should short-term interest rates rise, the Fund's
investment in TOB Residuals likely will adversely affect the Fund's investment
income -- net and distributions to shareholders. Fluctuations in the market
value of municipal securities deposited into the TOB may adversely affect the
Fund's net asset value per share.

While the Fund's investment policies and restrictions expressly permit
investments in inverse floating rate securities such as TOB Residuals, they
generally do not allow the Fund to borrow money for purposes of making
investments. The Fund's management believes that the Fund's restrictions on
borrowings do not apply to the secured borrowings deemed to have occurred for
accounting purposes.

(d) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(e) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(f) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(g) Recent accounting pronouncements -- In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48") "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." FIN
48 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in
connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or
expected to be

taken by an entity, including mutual funds, before being measured and recognized
in the financial statements. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for the last net
asset value calculation in the first required financial statement reporting
period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact on the
Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implication of FAS 157
and its impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been
determined.

In addition, in February 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
("FAS 159"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal
year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects
to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. At this time, management is evaluating
the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on the Fund's financial statements,
if any, has not been determined.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

On September 29, 2006, BlackRock, Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill
Lynch") combined Merrill Lynch's investment management business, Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers, L.P. ("MLIM") and its affiliates, including Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"), with BlackRock, Inc. to create a new independent
company. Merrill Lynch has a 49.8% economic interest and a 45% voting interest
in the combined company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. has
approximately a 34% economic and voting interest. The new company operates under
the BlackRock name and is governed by a board of directors with a majority of
independent members.

On August 15, 2006, shareholders of the Fund approved a new Investment Advisory
Agreement with BlackRock Advisors, Inc. BlackRock Advisors, Inc. was reorganized
into a limited liability company and renamed BlackRock Advisors, LLC (the
"Manager"). The new Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the
Manager became effective on September 29, 2006. Prior to September 29, 2006, FAM
was the manager. The general partner of FAM is an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, which is the limited partner.

The Manager is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .50% of the Fund's average daily net
assets, including net assets acquired from the sale of Preferred Stock. The
Manager (and previously FAM) has agreed to reimburse its management fee by the
amount of management fees the Fund pays to the Manager (and previously FAM)
indirectly through its investment in the Merrill Lynch Institutional Tax-Exempt
Fund. For the period September 1, 2006 to September 29, 2006, FAM reimbursed the
Fund in the amount of $1,469. For the period September 30, 2006 to August 31,
2007, the Manager reimbursed the Fund in the amount of $17,796.

In addition, the Manager has entered into a Sub-Advisory Agreement with
BlackRock Investment Management, LLC ("BIM"), an affiliate of the Manager, under
which the Manager pays BIM for services it provides a monthly fee that is a
percentage of the management fee paid by the Fund to the Manager.

For the year ended August 31, 2007, the Fund reimbursed FAM and the Manager $988
and $16,104, respectively, for certain accounting services.

Prior to September 29, 2006, certain officers and/or directors of the Fund were
officers and/or directors of FAM, Merrill Lynch and/or MLIM.

Commencing September 29, 2006, certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are
officers and/or directors of BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the
year ended August 31, 2007 were $401,058,986 and $398,163,459, respectively.

2007 and August 31, 2006 was as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       8/31/2007      8/31/2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions paid from:

                                                      --------------------------
Total distributions ..............................    $44,207,045    $47,230,435
                                                      ==========================

As of August 31, 2007, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undistributed tax-exempt income -- net ......................    $  3,243,931
Undistributed long-term capital gains -- net ................              --
Total undistributed earnings -- net .........................       3,243,931
Capital loss carryforward ...................................     (13,312,422)*
Unrealized gains -- net .....................................      15,205,550**

                                                                 ============

*     On August 31, 2007, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $13,312,422, all of which expires in 2009. This amount will be available
      to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized gains is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      tax deferral of losses on straddles and the difference between the book
      and tax treatment of residual interests in tender option bond trusts.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets, including the schedule
of investments, of BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2007, and the
related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of August 31, 2007, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2007, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

How the Plan Works -- The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by the Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the shareholders by The Bank of New York (the
"Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Fund declares a dividend,
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the participant's
account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized shares
of the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares of
Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset value per share is equal to
or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage commissions (a
condition often referred to as a "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest
the dividend amount in newly issued shares. If the Fund's net asset value per
share is greater than the market price per share (a condition often referred to
as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount by
purchasing on the open market additional shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend amount in open market purchases, or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent
will invest any uninvested portion in newly issued shares. The shares acquired
are credited to each shareholder's account. The amount credited is determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by either (i) when the shares are
newly issued, the net asset value per share on the date the shares are issued or
(ii) when shares are purchased in the open market, the average purchase price
per share.

Participation in the Plan -- Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Fund unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time
without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan -- The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants
in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they could otherwise
purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received. However, there may not be enough shares
available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem shares, the price on resale
may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees -- There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders will
pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications -- The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore, income and
capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not receive
cash. The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be
excluded from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would
be excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a
market premium, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a greater
fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible that all or
a portion of the discount from the market value (which may not exceed 5% of the
fair market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable
distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also
possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all
the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan.
Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information -- All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The Bank of
New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY 10286-1258,
Telephone: 800-432-8224.

Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which
comprises part of the financial information included in this report.

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level
of current income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which is exempt from federal income taxes in the opinion of bond counsel to
the issuer.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to the
shareholders of BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase of
shares of the Fund or any securities mentioned in the report. Past performance
results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. The Fund has leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Statements and other information herein
are as dated and are subject to change.

            the end of the period covered by this report, applicable to the
            registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial
            officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing
            similar functions. During the period covered by this report, there
            have been no amendments to or waivers granted under the code of
            ethics. A copy of the code of ethics is available without charge at
            www.blackrock.com.

Item 3 -    Audit Committee Financial Expert - The registrant's board of
            directors or trustees, as applicable (the "board of directors") has
            determined that (i) the registrant has the following audit committee
            financial experts serving on its audit committee and (ii) each audit
            committee financial expert is independent: (1) Ronald W. Forbes, (2)
            Richard R. West, and (3) Edward D. Zinbarg (retired as of December
            31, 2006).

            Under applicable securities laws, a person determined to be an audit
            committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any
            purpose, including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11
            of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or
            identified as an audit committee financial expert. The designation
            or identification as an audit committee financial expert does not
            impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liabilities
            greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on
            such person as a member of the audit committee and board of
            directors in the absence of such designation or identification.

related to the performance of the audit of financial statements not included in
Audit Fees.
2 The nature of the services include tax compliance, tax advice and tax
planning.
3 The nature of the services include a review of compliance procedures and
attestation thereto.

            (e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures:

                  The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
            policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
            Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
            registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
            Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
            provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to
            the registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly
            to the operations and the financial reporting of the registrant.
            Certain of these non-audit services that the Committee believes are
            a) consistent with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b)
            routine and recurring services that will not impair the independence
            of the independent accountants may be approved by the Committee
            without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis ("general
            pre-approval"). However, such services will only be deemed
            pre-approved provided that any individual project does not exceed
            $5,000 attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for all of the
            registrants the Committee oversees. Any proposed services exceeding
            the pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by
            the Committee, as will any other services not subject to general
            pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services). The
            Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
            pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board
            meeting.

<PAGE>

            (e)(2) None of the services described in each of Items 4(b) through
            (d) were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraph
            (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

            (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered and determined
            that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
            registrant's investment adviser (not including any non-affiliated
            sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
            subcontracted with or overseen by the registrant's investment
            adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
            control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services
            to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph
            (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
            maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

                      Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

      These Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures ("Policy") for BlackRock
Advisors, LLC and its affiliated U.S. registered investment advisers(1)
("BlackRock") reflect our duty as a fiduciary under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") to vote proxies in the best interests of our
clients. BlackRock serves as the investment manager for investment companies,
other commingled investment vehicles and/or separate accounts of institutional
and other clients. The right to vote proxies for securities held in such
accounts belongs to BlackRock's clients. Certain clients of BlackRock have
retained the right to vote such proxies in general or in specific
circumstances.(2) Other clients, however, have delegated to BlackRock the right
to vote proxies for securities held in their accounts as part of BlackRock's
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets.

      When BlackRock votes proxies for a client that has delegated to BlackRock
proxy voting authority, BlackRock acts as the client's agent. Under the Advisers
Act, an investment adviser is a fiduciary that owes each of its clients a duty
of care and loyalty with respect to all services the adviser undertakes on the
client's behalf, including proxy voting. BlackRock is therefore subject to a
fiduciary duty to vote proxies in a manner BlackRock believes is consistent with
the client's best interests,(3) whether or not the client's proxy voting is
subject to the fiduciary standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 ("ERISA").(4) When voting proxies for client accounts (including
investment companies), BlackRock's primary objective is to make voting decisions
solely in the best interests of clients and ERISA clients' plan beneficiaries
and participants. In fulfilling its obligations to clients, BlackRock will seek
to act in a manner that it believes is most likely to enhance the economic value
of the underlying securities held in client accounts.(5) It is imperative that
BlackRock considers the interests of its clients, and not the interests of
BlackRock, when voting proxies and that real (or perceived) material conflicts
that may arise between BlackRock's interest and those of BlackRock's clients are
properly addressed and resolved.

- ----------
(1) The Policy does not apply to BlackRock Asset Management U.K. Limited and
BlackRock Investment Managers International Limited, which are U.S. registered
investment advisers based in the United Kingdom.

(2) In certain situations, a client may direct BlackRock to vote in accordance
with the client's proxy voting policies. In these situations, BlackRock will
seek to comply with such policies to the extent it would not be inconsistent
with other BlackRock legal responsibilities.

(3) Letter from Harvey L. Pitt, Chairman, SEC, to John P.M. Higgins, President,
Ram Trust Services (February 12, 2002) (Section 206 of the Investment Advisers
Act imposes a fiduciary responsibility to vote proxies fairly and in the best
interests of clients); SEC Release No. IA-2106 (February 3, 2003).

(4) DOL Interpretative Bulletin of Sections 402, 403 and 404 of ERISA at 29
C.F.R. 2509.94-2.

(5) Other considerations, such as social, labor, environmental or other
policies, may be of interest to particular clients. While BlackRock is cognizant
of the importance of such considerations, when voting proxies it will generally
take such matters into account only to the extent that they have a direct
bearing on the economic value of the underlying securities. To the extent that a
BlackRock client desires to pursue a particular social, labor, environmental or
other agenda through the proxy votes made for its securities held through
BlackRock as investment adviser, BlackRock encourages the client to consider
retaining direct proxy voting authority or to appoint independently a special
proxy voting fiduciary other than BlackRock.


                                       1
<PAGE>

      Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-6 was adopted by the SEC in 2003 and requires,
among other things, that an investment adviser that exercises voting authority
over clients' proxy voting adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients,
discloses to its clients information about those policies and procedures and
also discloses to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has
voted their proxies.

      In light of such fiduciary duties, the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6, and
given the complexity of the issues that may be raised in connection with proxy
votes, BlackRock has adopted these policies and procedures. BlackRock's Equity
Investment Policy Oversight Committee, or a sub-committee thereof (the
"Committee"), addresses proxy voting issues on behalf of BlackRock and its
clients.(6) The Committee is comprised of senior members of BlackRock's
Portfolio Management Group and advised by BlackRock's Legal and Compliance
Department.

- ----------
(6) Subject to the Proxy Voting Policies of Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Company
FSB, the Committee may also function jointly as the Proxy Voting Committee for
Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Company FSB trust accounts managed by personnel
dually-employed by BlackRock.

I. Scope of Committee Responsibilities

      The Committee shall have the responsibility for determining how to address
proxy votes made on behalf of all BlackRock clients, except for clients who have
retained the right to vote their own proxies, either generally or on any
specific matter. In so doing, the Committee shall seek to ensure that proxy
votes are made in the best interests of clients, and that proxy votes are
determined in a manner free from unwarranted or inappropriate influences. The
Committee shall also oversee the overall administration of proxy voting for
BlackRock accounts.(7)

      The Committee shall establish BlackRock's proxy voting guidelines, with
such advice, participation and research as the Committee deems appropriate from
portfolio managers, proxy voting services or other knowledgeable interested
parties. As it is anticipated that there will not necessarily be a "right" way
to vote proxies on any given issue applicable to all facts and circumstances,
the Committee shall also be responsible for determining how the proxy voting
guidelines will be applied to specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's
unique structure, management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances,
probable economic and other anticipated consequences of alternative actions. In
so doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a manner
contrary to its generally stated guidelines.

      The Committee may determine that the subject matter of certain proxy
issues are not suitable for general voting guidelines and requires a
case-by-case determination, in which case the Committee may elect not to adopt a
specific voting guideline applicable to such issues. BlackRock believes that
certain proxy voting issues - such as approval of mergers and other significant
corporate transactions - require investment analysis akin to investment
decisions, and are therefore not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee
may elect to adopt a common BlackRock position on certain proxy votes that are
akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit portfolio managers to make
individual decisions on how best to maximize economic value for the accounts for
which they are responsible (similar to normal buy/sell investment decisions made
by such portfolio managers).(8)

      While it is expected that BlackRock, as a fiduciary, will generally seek
to vote proxies over which BlackRock exercises voting authority in a uniform
manner for all BlackRock clients, the Committee, in conjunction with the
portfolio manager of an account, may determine that the specific circumstances
of such account require that such account's proxies be voted differently due to
such account's investment objective or other factors that differentiate it from
other accounts. In addition, on proxy votes that are akin to investment
decisions, BlackRock believes portfolio managers may from time to time

- ----------
(7) The Committee may delegate day-to-day administrative responsibilities to
other BlackRock personnel and/or outside service providers, as appropriate.

(8) The Committee will normally defer to portfolio managers on proxy votes that
are akin to investment decisions except for proxy votes that involve a material
conflict of interest, in which case it will determine, in its discretion, the
appropriate voting process so as to address such conflict.


                                       3

legitimately reach differing but equally valid views, as fiduciaries for
BlackRock's clients, on how best to maximize economic value in respect of a
particular investment.

      The Committee will also be responsible for ensuring the maintenance of
records of each proxy vote, as required by Advisers Act Rule 204-2.(9) All
records will be maintained in accordance with applicable law. Except as may be
required by applicable legal requirements, or as otherwise set forth herein, the
Committee's determinations and records shall be treated as proprietary,
nonpublic and confidential.

      The Committee shall be assisted by other BlackRock personnel, as may be
appropriate. In particular, the Committee has delegated to the BlackRock
Operations Department responsibility for monitoring corporate actions and
ensuring that proxy votes are submitted in a timely fashion. The Operations
Department shall ensure that proxy voting issues are promptly brought to the
Committee's attention and that the Committee's proxy voting decisions are
appropriately disseminated and implemented.

      To assist BlackRock in voting proxies, the Committee may retain the
services of a firm providing such services. BlackRock has currently retained
Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") in that role. ISS is an independent
adviser that specializes in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related
services to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians,
consultants, and other institutional investors. The services provided to
BlackRock may include, but are not limited to, in-depth research, voting
recommendations (which the Committee is not obligated to follow), vote
execution, and recordkeeping.

- ----------
(9) The Committee may delegate the actual maintenance of such records to an
outside service provider. Currently, the Committee has delegated the maintenance
of such records to Institutional Shareholder Services.

II. Special Circumstances

      Routine Consents. BlackRock may be asked from time to time to consent to
an amendment to, or grant a waiver under, a loan agreement, partnership
agreement, indenture or other governing document of a specific financial
instrument held by BlackRock clients. BlackRock will generally treat such
requests for consents not as "proxies" subject to these Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures but as investment matters to be dealt with by the responsible
BlackRock investment professionals would, provided that such consents (i) do not
relate to the election of a board of directors or appointment of auditors of a
public company, and (ii) either (A) would not otherwise materially affect the
structure, management or control of a public company, or (B) relate to a company
in which BlackRock clients hold only interests in bank loans or debt securities
and are consistent with customary standards and practices for such instruments.

      Securities on Loan. Registered investment companies that are advised by
BlackRock as well as certain of our advisory clients may participate in
securities lending programs. Under most securities lending arrangements,
securities on loan may not be voted by the lender (unless the loan is recalled).
BlackRock believes that each client has the right to determine whether
participating in a securities lending program enhances returns, to contract with
the securities lending agent of its choice and to structure a securities lending
program, through its lending agent, that balances any tension between loaning
and voting securities in a matter that satisfies such client. If client has
decided to participate in a securities lending program, BlackRock will therefore
defer to the client's determination and not attempt to seek recalls solely for
the purpose of voting routine proxies as this could impact the returns received
from securities lending and make the client a less desirable lender in a
marketplace. Where a client retains a lending agent that is unaffiliated with
BlackRock, BlackRock will generally not seek to vote proxies relating to
securities on loan because BlackRock does not have a contractual right to recall
such loaned securities for the purpose of voting proxies. Where BlackRock or an
affiliate acts as the lending agent, BlackRock will also generally not seek to
recall loaned securities for proxy voting purposes, unless the portfolio manager
responsible for the account or the Committee determines that voting the proxy is
in the client's best interest and requests that the security be recalled.

      Voting Proxies for Non-US Companies. While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States, voting proxies of non-US companies
frequently involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock's ability to
vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These
issues include (but are not limited to): (i) untimely notice of shareholder
meetings, (ii) restrictions on a foreigner's ability to exercise votes, (iii)
requirements to vote proxies in person, (iv) "shareblocking" (requirements that
investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of
their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder
meeting), (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy, and (vi)
requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to
facilitate voting instructions.


                                       5
<PAGE>

      As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies of non-US companies only on a
"best-efforts" basis. In addition, the Committee may determine that it is
generally in the best interests of BlackRock clients not to vote proxies of
companies in certain countries if the Committee determines that the costs
(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with shareblocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote generally are expected to
outweigh the benefit the client will derive by voting on the issuer's proposal.
If the Committee so determines in the case of a particular country, the
Committee (upon advice from BlackRock portfolio managers) may override such
determination with respect to a particular issuer's shareholder meeting if the
Committee believes the benefits of seeking to exercise a vote at such meeting
outweighs the costs, in which case BlackRock will seek to vote on a best-efforts
basis.

      Securities Sold After Record Date. With respect to votes in connection
with securities held on a particular record date but sold from a client account
prior to the holding of the related meeting, BlackRock may take no action on
proposals to be voted on in such meeting.

      Conflicts of Interest. From time to time, BlackRock may be required to
vote proxies in respect of an issuer that is an affiliate of BlackRock (a
"BlackRock Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of BlackRock (a
"BlackRock Client").(10) In such event, provided that the Committee is aware of
the real or potential conflict, the following procedures apply:

      o     The Committee intends to adhere to the voting guidelines set forth
            herein for all proxy issues including matters involving BlackRock
            Affiliates and BlackRock Clients. The Committee may, in its
            discretion for the purposes of ensuring that an independent
            determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to advise
            the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of
            BlackRock's clients; and

      o     if the Committee determines not to retain an independent fiduciary,
            or does not desire to follow the advice of such independent
            fiduciary, the Committee shall determine how to vote the proxy after
            consulting with the BlackRock Legal and Compliance Department and
            concluding that the vote cast is in the client's best interest
            notwithstanding the conflict.

- ----------
(10) Such issuers may include investment companies for which BlackRock provides
investment advisory, administrative and/or other services.

III. Voting Guidelines

      The Committee has determined that it is appropriate and in the best
interests of BlackRock's clients to adopt the following voting guidelines, which
represent the Committee's usual voting position on certain recurring proxy
issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances. With respect to
any particular proxy issue, however, the Committee may elect to vote differently
than a voting guideline if the Committee determines that doing so is, in the
Committee's judgment, in the best interest of its clients. The guidelines may be
reviewed at any time upon the request of any Committee member and may be amended
or deleted upon the vote of a majority of voting Committee members present at a
Committee meeting for which there is a quorum.


                                       7

      A. Boards of Directors

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders relating to
the composition of the Board of Directors of companies other than investment
companies. As a general matter, the Committee believes that a company's Board of
Directors (rather than shareholders) is most likely to have access to important,
nonpublic information regarding a company's business and prospects, and is
therefore best-positioned to set corporate policy and oversee management. The
Committee therefore believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is
the election of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to
diligently represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over time.
In individual cases, the Committee may look at a Director nominee's history of
representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies, or other
factors to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#     VOTE and DESCRIPTION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.1   FOR nominees for director of United States companies in uncontested
      elections, except for nominees who
      o     have missed at least two meetings and, as a result, attended less
            than 75% of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees
            the previous year, unless the nominee missed the meeting(s) due to
            illness or company business
      o     voted to implement or renew a "dead-hand" poison pill
      o     ignored a shareholder proposal that was approved by either a
            majority of the shares outstanding in any year or by the majority of
            votes cast for two consecutive years
      o     failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the
            shareholders have tendered their shares
      o     are corporate insiders who serve on the audit, compensation or
            nominating committees or on a full Board that does not have such
            committees composed exclusively of independent directors
      o     on a case-by-case basis, have served as directors of other companies
            with allegedly poor corporate governance
      o     sit on more than six boards of public companies
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.2   FOR nominees for directors of non-U.S. companies in uncontested elections,
      except for nominees from whom the Committee determines to withhold votes
      due to the nominees' poor records of representing shareholder interests,
      on a case-by-case basis
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.3   FOR proposals to declassify Boards of Directors, except where there exists
      a legitimate purpose for classifying boards
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.4   AGAINST proposals to classify Boards of Directors, except where there
      exists a legitimate purpose for classifying boards
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                       8

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.5   AGAINST proposals supporting cumulative voting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.6   FOR proposals eliminating cumulative voting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.7   FOR proposals supporting confidential voting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.8   FOR proposals seeking election of supervisory board members
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.9   AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking additional representation of women
      and/or minorities generally (i.e., not specific individuals) to a Board of
      Directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.10  AGAINST shareholder proposals for term limits for directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.11  FOR shareholder proposals to establish a mandatory retirement age for
      directors who attain the age of 72 or older
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.12  AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring directors to own a minimum amount
      of company stock
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.13  FOR proposals requiring a majority of independent directors on a Board of
      Directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.14  FOR proposals to allow a Board of Directors to delegate powers to a
      committee or committees
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.15  FOR proposals to require audit, compensation and/or nominating committees
      of a Board of Directors to consist exclusively of independent directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.16  AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking to prohibit a single person from
      occupying the roles of chairman and chief executive officer
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.21  FOR proposals permitting shareholder ability to remove directors directly
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.22  AGAINST proposals to eliminate shareholder ability to remove directors
      directly
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

      B. Auditors

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders related to
the selection of auditors. As a general matter, the Committee believes that
corporate auditors have a responsibility to represent the interests of
shareholders and provide an independent view on the propriety of financial
reporting decisions of corporate management. While the Committee will generally
defer to a corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee
may look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.1   FOR approval of independent auditors, except for
      o     auditors that have a financial interest in, or material association
            with, the company they are auditing, and are therefore believed by
            the Committee not to be independent
      o     auditors who have rendered an opinion to any company which in the
            Committee's opinion is either not consistent with best accounting
            practices or not indicative of the company's financial situation
      o     on a case-by-case basis, auditors who in the Committee's opinion
            provide a significant amount of non-audit services to the company
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.2   FOR proposals seeking authorization to fix the remuneration of auditors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.3   FOR approving internal statutory auditors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.4   FOR proposals for audit firm rotation, except for proposals that would
      require rotation after a period of less than 5 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                       10
<PAGE>

      C. Compensation and Benefits

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders related to
management compensation and employee benefits. As a general matter, the
Committee favors disclosure of a company's compensation and benefit policies and
opposes excessive compensation, but believes that compensation matters are
normally best determined by a corporation's board of directors, rather than
shareholders. Proposals to "micro-manage" a company's compensation practices or
to set arbitrary restrictions on compensation or benefits will therefore
generally not be supported.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.1   IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF ISS on compensation plans if the
      ISS recommendation is based solely on whether or not the company's plan
      satisfies the allowable cap as calculated by ISS. If the recommendation of
      ISS is based on factors other than whether the plan satisfies the
      allowable cap the Committee will analyze the particular proposed plan.
      This policy applies to amendments of plans as well as to initial
      approvals.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.2   FOR proposals to eliminate retirement benefits for outside directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.3   AGAINST proposals to establish retirement benefits for outside directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.4   FOR proposals approving the remuneration of directors or of supervisory
      board members
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.5   AGAINST proposals to reprice stock options
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.6   FOR proposals to approve employee stock purchase plans that apply to all
      employees. This policy applies to proposals to amend ESPPs if the plan as
      amended applies to all employees.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.7   FOR proposals to pay retirement bonuses to directors of Japanese companies
      unless the directors have served less than three years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.8   AGAINST proposals seeking to pay outside directors only in stock
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.9   FOR proposals seeking further disclosure of executive pay or requiring
      companies to report on their supplemental executive retirement benefits
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.10  AGAINST proposals to ban all future stock or stock option grants to
      executives
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.11  AGAINST option plans or grants that apply to directors or employees of
      "related companies" without adequate disclosure of the corporate
      relationship and justification of the option policy
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.12  FOR proposals to exclude pension plan income in the calculation of
      earnings used in determining executive bonuses/compensation
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

      D. Capital Structure

      These proposals relate to various requests, principally from management,
for approval of amendments that would alter the capital structure of a company,
such as an increase in authorized shares. As a general matter, the Committee
will support requests that it believes enhance the rights of common shareholders
and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably dilutive.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.1   AGAINST proposals seeking authorization to issue shares without preemptive
      rights except for issuances up to 10% of a non-US company's total
      outstanding capital
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.2   FOR management proposals seeking preemptive rights or seeking
      authorization to issue shares with preemptive rights
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.3   FOR management proposals approving share repurchase programs
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.4   FOR management proposals to split a company's stock
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.5   FOR management proposals to denominate or authorize denomination of
      securities or other obligations or assets in Euros
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.6   FOR proposals requiring a company to expense stock options (unless the
      company has already publicly committed to do so by a certain date).
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      E. Corporate Charter and By-Laws

      These proposals relate to various requests for approval of amendments to a
corporation's charter or by-laws, principally for the purpose of adopting or
redeeming "poison pills". As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
provisions.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.1   AGAINST proposals seeking to adopt a poison pill
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.2   FOR proposals seeking to redeem a poison pill
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.3   FOR proposals seeking to have poison pills submitted to shareholders for
      ratification
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.4   FOR management proposals to change the company's name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      F. Corporate Meetings

      These are routine proposals relating to various requests regarding the
formalities of corporate meetings.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.1   AGAINST proposals that seek authority to act on "any other business that
      may arise"
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.2   FOR proposals designating two shareholders to keep minutes of the meeting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.3   FOR proposals concerning accepting or approving financial statements and
      statutory reports
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.4   FOR proposals approving the discharge of management and the supervisory
      board
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.5   FOR proposals approving the allocation of income and the dividend
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.6   FOR proposals seeking authorization to file required documents/other
      formalities
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.7   FOR proposals to authorize the corporate board to ratify and execute
      approved resolutions
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.8   FOR proposals appointing inspectors of elections
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.9   FOR proposals electing a chair of the meeting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.10  FOR proposals to permit "virtual" shareholder meetings over the Internet
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.11  AGAINST proposals to require rotating sites for shareholder meetings
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                       14

      G. Investment Companies

      These proposals relate to proxy issues that are associated solely with
holdings of shares of investment companies, including, but not limited to,
investment companies for which BlackRock provides investment advisory,
administrative and/or other services. As with other types of companies, the
Committee believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its
shareholders) is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management.
However, the Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over
certain matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
Investment Company Act of 1940 envisions will be approved directly by
shareholders.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.1   FOR nominees for director of mutual funds in uncontested elections, except
      for nominees who
      o     have missed at least two meetings and, as a result, attended less
            than 75% of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees
            the previous year, unless the nominee missed the meeting due to
            illness or fund business
      o     ignore a shareholder proposal that was approved by either a majority
            of the shares outstanding in any year or by the majority of votes
            cast for two consecutive years
      o     are interested directors who serve on the audit or nominating
            committees or on a full Board that does not have such committees
            composed exclusively of independent directors
      o     on a case-by-case basis, have served as directors of companies with
            allegedly poor corporate governance
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.2   FOR the establishment of new series or classes of shares
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.3   AGAINST proposals to change a fund's investment objective to
      nonfundamental
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.4   FOR proposals to establish a master-feeder structure or authorizing the
      Board to approve a master-feeder structure without a further shareholder
      vote
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.5   AGAINST a shareholder proposal for the establishment of a director
      ownership requirement
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.6   FOR classified boards of closed-end investment companies
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                       15

      H. Environmental and Social Issues

      These are shareholder proposals to limit corporate conduct in some manner
that relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are inappropriate
forums for the discussion of larger social issues, and opposes shareholder
resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting release of
information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an investment in the
corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee is generally supportive
of proposals to require corporate disclosure of matters that seem relevant and
material to the economic interests of shareholders, the Committee is generally
not supportive of proposals to require disclosure of corporate matters for other
purposes.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.1   AGAINST proposals seeking to have companies adopt international codes of
      conduct
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.2   AGAINST proposals seeking to have companies provide non-required reports
      on:
      o     environmental liabilities;
      o     bank lending policies;
      o     corporate political contributions or activities;
      o     alcohol advertising and efforts to discourage drinking by minors;
      o     costs and risk of doing business in any individual country;
      o     involvement in nuclear defense systems
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.3   AGAINST proposals requesting reports on Maquiladora operations or on CERES
      principles
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.4   AGAINST proposals seeking implementation of the CERES principles
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest

            BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
            compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
            protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
            another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address
            the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
            transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
            conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client

<PAGE>

            accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
            furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
            clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
            applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
            accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have
            performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio
            managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees),
            which may be the same as or different from those made to the Fund.
            In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and any officer, director,
            stockholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the
            securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Fund.
            BlackRock, or any of its affiliates, or any officer, director,
            stockholder, employee or any member of their families may take
            different actions than those recommended to the Fund by BlackRock
            with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain
            from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of
            companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
            directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
            which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors
            and employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest
            or possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager
            also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be
            opposed to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection,
            it should be noted that certain portfolio managers currently manage
            certain accounts that are subject to performance fees. In addition,
            certain portfolio managers assist in managing certain hedge funds
            and may be entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees
            earned on such funds and a portion of such incentive fees may be
            voluntarily or involuntarily deferred. Additional portfolio managers
            may in the future manage other such accounts or funds and may be
            entitled to receive incentive fees.

            As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
            must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
            securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated
            in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts
            to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
            accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
            end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
            investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
            client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve
            reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock
            with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that
            is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client
            base.

            (a)(3) As of August 31, 2007:

            Portfolio Manager Compensation

                  Compensation Program

                  The elements of total compensation for portfolio managers on
            BlackRock's municipal team include a fixed base salary, annual
            performance-based cash and stock compensation (cash and stock bonus)
            and other benefits. BlackRock has balanced these components of pay
            to provide these portfolio managers with a powerful incentive to
            achieve consistently superior investment performance. By design,
            compensation levels for these portfolio managers fluctuate--both up
            and down--with the relative investment performance of the portfolios
            that they manage.

                  Base compensation

                  Like that of many asset management firms, base salaries
            represent a relatively small portion of a portfolio manager's total
            compensation. This approach serves to enhance the motivational value
            of the performance-based (and therefore variable) compensation
            elements of the compensation program.

<PAGE>

                  Performance-Based Compensation

                  BlackRock believes that the best interests of investors are
            served by recruiting and retaining exceptional asset management
            talent and managing their compensation within a consistent and
            disciplined framework that emphasizes pay for performance in the
            context of an intensely competitive market for talent. To that end,
            BlackRock and its affiliates portfolio manager incentive
            compensation is based on a formulaic compensation program.
            BlackRock's formulaic portfolio manager compensation program
            includes: investment performance relative to a subset of general,
            closed-end, leveraged municipal debt funds over 1-, 3- and 5-year
            performance periods and a measure of operational efficiency.
            Portfolio managers are compensated based on the pre-tax performance
            of the products they manage. If a portfolio manager's tenure is less
            than 5 years, performance periods will reflect time in position.
            Portfolio managers are compensated based on products they manage. A
            discretionary element of portfolio manager compensation may include
            consideration of: financial results, expense control, profit
            margins, strategic planning and implementation, quality of client
            service, market share, corporate reputation, capital allocation,
            compliance and risk control, leadership, workforce diversity,
            supervision, technology and innovation. All factors are considered
            collectively by BlackRock management.

                  Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP)

                  The LTIP is a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward
            certain key employees. The plan provides for the grant of awards
            that are expressed as an amount of cash that, if properly vested and
            subject to the attainment of certain performance goals, will be
            settled in cash and/or in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.

                  Cash Bonus

                  Performance-based compensation is distributed to portfolio
            managers in a combination of cash and stock. Typically, the cash
            bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of
            total compensation for portfolio managers.

                  Stock Bonus

                  A portion of the dollar value of the total annual
            performance-based bonus is paid in restricted shares of BlackRock
            stock. Paying a portion of annual bonuses in stock puts compensation
            earned by a portfolio manager for a given year "at risk" based on
            the company's ability to sustain and improve its performance over
            future periods. The ultimate value of stock bonuses is dependent on
            future BlackRock stock price performance. As such, the stock bonus
            aligns each portfolio manager's financial interests with those of
            the BlackRock shareholders and encourages a balance between
            short-term goals and long-term strategic objectives. Management
            strongly believes that providing a significant portion of
            competitive performance-based compensation in stock is in the best
            interests of investors and shareholders. This approach ensures that
            portfolio managers participate as shareholders in both the "downside
            risk" and "upside opportunity" of the company's performance.
            Portfolio managers therefore have a direct incentive to protect
            BlackRock's reputation for integrity.

<PAGE>

                  Other Compensation Programs

                  Portfolio managers who meet relative investment performance
            and financial management objectives during a performance year are
            eligible to participate in a deferred cash program. Awards under
            this program are in the form of deferred cash that may be
            benchmarked to a menu of BlackRock mutual funds (including their own
            fund) during a five-year vesting period. The deferred cash program
            aligns the interests of participating portfolio managers with the
            investment results of BlackRock products and promotes continuity of
            successful portfolio management teams.

                  Other Benefits

                  Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
            broad-based plans offered generally to employees of BlackRock and
            its affiliates, including broad-based retirement, 401(k), health,
            and other employee benefit plans.

            (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of August 31, 2007,
            none of Messrs. Stuebe, Jaeckel or O'Connor beneficially owned any
