                                                              PRESIDENT'S LETTER

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:                                                   JULY 2004

The stock market posted a modest advance during the second quarter, as the S&P
500 Index gained 1.7 percent during the period. The gain duplicated the index's
1.7 percent advance in the first quarter, bringing its first half return to 3.4
percent. The S&P 500 declined in April, but gained ground in May and June to
conclude the half.

    The quarter was marked by the prospect of higher interest rates, rising oil
prices, fears surrounding the handover of power in Iraq and concerns over a
slowdown in global economic growth. All contributed to sluggishness in share
prices. With this uncertainty as a backdrop, small cap stocks underperformed
large cap stocks; energy stocks advanced, and financial stocks declined owing to
concerns over higher interest rates. Stocks have experienced a broad based
decline thus far in July as the market has failed to overcome the aforementioned
concerns.

    On the positive side, the economy continued to expand and corporate earnings
continued to rise. During the quarter, the government reported a 4.4 percent
rise in first quarter GDP, up from the solid 4.1 percent pace registered in the
fourth quarter of 2003. By the time all reports are in, year-over-year second
quarter corporate earnings are expected to be ahead by more than 20 percent for
the fourth quarter in a row--a rare event.

    We continued to see a gradual rotation toward higher quality stocks--those
companies that exhibit sustainable earnings growth, strong balance sheets and
solid cash flow. However, for the entire first half the lowest quality stocks
still narrowly outperformed the highest quality ones. In terms of style, value
outperformed growth across the board--large, mid and small-cap--during the first
half.

    Liberty All-Star Equity Fund posted a generally positive quarter. With
shares valued at net asset value (NAV) with dividends reinvested, the Fund
gained 2.6 percent. This result topped the S&P 500 Index and was ahead of the
Fund's primary benchmark, the Lipper Large-Cap Core Mutual Fund Average, which
advanced 0.9 percent. For the first half, the Fund gained 5.6 percent with
shares valued at NAV with dividends reinvested. By comparison, the S&P 500
Index, as mentioned, gained 3.4 percent for the half, while the Lipper Large-Cap
Core Mutual Fund Average advanced 2.0 percent.

    The sole reversal for the quarter was a 6.4 percent decline in the market
value of Fund shares with dividends reinvested. This was in sharp contrast to
the solid NAV

                                        1
<Page>

investment performance. During the quarter, the premium at which Fund shares
traded above NAV reached a high of 13.6 percent which, history shows, was
unsustainably high. By quarter-end, the Fund continued to trade at a modest
premium to NAV, and its market price return for the first half was on the
positive side at 2.3 percent.

    Long term, the Fund continues to perform well. The Fund ranks in the top 20
percent of funds in the Lipper Large-Cap Core Mutual Fund universe since the
Fund's first full calendar year of operation, more than 17 years ago. One-,
three- and five-year Fund returns are all in the top 5 percent of that Lipper
universe.

    In other Fund news, the offering to shareholders of rights to purchase
additional shares of the Fund was completed successfully. The offering, which
allowed investors to subscribe for one additional share for each 10 shares
owned, was oversubscribed. In accord with previously announced terms of the
offering, the number of shares offered was increased by an additional 25 percent
to cover a portion of the over-subscription requests. This brought the total
value of the offering to approximately $132 million. We at Liberty Asset
Management Company (LAMCO) are gratified by this response, and thank
shareholders for their confidence in the Fund.

    We invite you to read the interview with investment manager Arnold Schneider
of Schneider Capital Management beginning on page 8. This is the first interview
of this manager since we introduced him to Fund shareholders in the first
quarter report of 2002. We believe you'll find his comments to be interesting
and insightful.

    Once again, we at LAMCO thank shareholders for their ongoing support of the
Fund. We believe that the Fund is properly structured with a quality team of
investment managers, giving us confidence as we move into the future.

Sincerely,

/s/ William R. Parmentier, Jr.

The dark blue region of the graph above reflects the growth of the investment
assuming all distributions were received in cash and not reinvested back in the
Fund. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $46,017 (this
value includes distributions per share totaling $18.40 during the period,
including tax credits of $0.67 per share on retained capital gains).

    The light blue region of the graph depicts additional value realized through
reinvestment of all distributions and participation in all the rights offerings
under the terms of each offering. On five occasions, the Fund has conducted
rights offerings that allowed shareholders to purchase additional shares at a
discount. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $93,457.

MANAGER INTERVIEW

ARNOLD C. SCHNEIDER, III
President and Chief Investment Officer
Schneider Capital Management Corporation

WHEN A STOCK IS OUT OF FAVOR, IT MIGHT FIND A FRIEND IN SCM--IF THERE'S REASON
TO ANTICIPATE A REBOUND IN FUNDAMENTALS

SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (SCM) IS A VALUE STYLE MANAGER PRACTICING A
DISCIPLINED FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH TO ADD VALUE OVER TIME. A RESEARCH-INTENSIVE
MANAGER, SCM FOCUSES ON UNCOVERING NEW IDEAS IN THE BELIEF THAT THE BROADER
MARKET IS SLOW TO REACT TO CHANGE, PARTICULARLY WHERE OUT-OF-FAVOR STOCKS ARE
CONCERNED. OWNING THESE STOCKS BEFORE THEY EXPERIENCE A REBOUND IN EARNINGS AND
COME TO THE ATTENTION OF OTHER INVESTORS CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PRICE
APPRECIATION BEFORE FUNDAMENTALS WARRANT THE STOCK BE SOLD. RECENTLY, WE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ARNOLD C. SCHNEIDER, III, CFA, THE FIRM'S FOUNDER,
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER.

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS INTERVIEW REPRESENT THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S POSITION
AT THE TIME OF THE DISCUSSION (JULY 2004) AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

LAMCO: THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE IN DEPTH FOR A SHAREHOLDER REPORT WAS IN THE FIRST
QUARTER OF 2002, AND THAT WAS ALSO YOUR FIRST INTERVIEW FOR LIBERTY ALL-STAR
EQUITY FUND. AS A REFRESHER AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF NEW FUND SHAREHOLDERS, TELL
US A LITTLE ABOUT SCM.

SCHNEIDER: We started Schneider Capital Management in 1996. We're located in
Wayne, Pennsylvania, and the firm is 100 percent employee owned. We have about
$3 billion in total assets under management. Our clients are mostly
institutions, including corporations, endowments, foundations and public
retirement systems.

    As to our investment philosophy, it's one of deep value. We focus on
companies that are out-of-favor in the marketplace but that, in our assessment,
have the ability to repair their current performance and return to former levels
of earnings. We generally expect to see improvement in these companies'
fundamentals around a year after their purchase. SCM has a solid research
foundation focused on new idea generation, and we believe in managing relatively
concentrated portfolios that are focused on the best ideas our research process
can produce.

LAMCO: You describe Schneider Capital Management as "research intensive." Given
that many, if not most, managers use or rely on research, what is unique or
differentiating about SCM's research?

SCHNEIDER: For one thing, we try to

[SIDENOTE]

"WE FOCUS ON COMPANIES THAT ARE OUT-OF-FAVOR IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT THAT...HAVE
THE ABILITY TO REPAIR THEIR CURRENT PERFORMANCE AND RETURN TO FORMER LEVELS OF
EARNINGS."

                                        8
<Page>

focus on the future. Spending time on the past or present simply isn't
productive because all of that is already fully discounted in the marketplace.
We also try to be relatively efficient by focusing only on those elements of a
company's business that will ultimately drive its profitability. Finally, ours
is very much a hands-on process. We're quite independent, we have our own point
of view and we don't rely on quantitative research or computer screens.

LAMCO: YOUR "SCM VALUE CYCLE" ILLUSTRATES YOUR PHILOSOPHY QUITE WELL. WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE IT FOR US?

SCHNEIDER: There are five phases to the SCM value cycle--reject, consider, buy,
hold and sell.

    Taking them in order, the "reject" stage is what's sometimes called the
"value trap" stage. That's when a company's stock appears to be cheap but really
isn't, either because earnings are unsustainably high or because the industry is
about to undergo secular change that's going to cause returns to permanently
decline. The "consider" stage is the reject stage after some of the negative
elements have been disseminated in the marketplace. At this point, the stock is
even cheaper. The negative cards have been turned over and it's now obvious that
company fundamentals are deteriorating and the stock is now out of favor and
completely friendless. No one is recommending it. We wouldn't buy in the
consider stage, however, until we feel that there's a bottom and the
fundamentals are no longer declining. That's the point when we move into the
"buy" stage--when the stock is undervalued but the fundamentals have at least
stopped deteriorating. We aren't necessarily looking for an immediate first leg
up. But, we do expect the fundamentals to begin to improve over the ensuing
year. The "hold" stage phases in as the fundamentals are starting to turn up.
The stock price may be higher, but mostly fundamentals are getting better.
Typically, however, the kinds of companies that we own still have a long way to
go at this stage, so we let our winners run and we hold our stocks in this
category. Ultimately, we move into the "sell" stage either because the stock
hits our price target or because the positive fundamentals have now run their
course and aren't going to get any better.

LAMCO: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A TYPICAL HOLDING PERIOD?

SCHNEIDER: We really don't have a typical holding period. If we miss on a stock
and it turns out to be a loser, we will hold it for a very short period of time.
On the other hand, we will hold some of our winners for five years or longer. If
pressed, I would say that our successful investments most often fall into the
three- to four-year timeframe.

LAMCO: INVESTORS READ AND HEAR A LOT ABOUT MACRO FACTORS THESE DAYS. THEY
INCLUDE INFLATION, HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGH OIL PRICES, PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS
AND GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS. TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU FACTOR TOP-DOWN CONCERNS INTO
YOUR THINKING, OR ARE YOU STRICTLY BOTTOM-UP?

SCHNEIDER: We do use macro factors to provide a framework for our
decision-making, but macro factors don't play a

[SIDENOTE]

"...WE BELIEVE IN MANAGING RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE FOCUSED
ON THE BEST IDEAS OUR RESEARCH PROCESS CAN PRODUCE."

                                        9
<Page>

significant role in our stock selection process. We're primarily a bottom-up
stock picker. We mostly use macro factors to keep us away from certain areas as
opposed to guiding us towards areas for investment.

LAMCO: EARLIER, YOU MENTIONED YOUR BELIEF IN CONCENTRATED PORTFOLIOS WHERE YOU
CAN LET YOUR BEST IDEAS IMPACT OVERALL PERFORMANCE. CAN YOU DESCRIBE A TYPICAL
SCHNEIDER PORTFOLIO?

SCHNEIDER: We usually have 50 to 60 stocks, with the top 10 holdings
representing one-third of the market value of the portfolio. We have industry
and sector weightings that are often meaningfully different from a large cap
value benchmark, such as the Russell 1000 Value Index. We're not trying to
replicate benchmarks because we don't closet index. We let bottom-up decisions
lead us to our weightings.

LAMCO: YOU PRACTICE A RIGOROUS SELL DISCIPLINE. CAN YOU SUMMARIZE IT FOR US?

SCHNEIDER: I already mentioned two of the ways we sell: when a stock reaches its
target price or when the fundamentals begin to deteriorate. A third way would be
if a new idea has better investment potential versus an older idea that may not
necessarily have reached its target but has lower potential than the new one.
So, we would trim the existing holding to make room for the new one. The other
scenario is just a matter of portfolio construction--if there's a certain
industry exposure that becomes too great or if a single position just becomes
too large. We don't want any single holding to exceed 5 percent of the portfolio
at cost or 8 percent of the portfolio at market value.

LAMCO: CATCH US UP ON HOW, IN GENERAL, VALUE PERFORMED THROUGH 2003 AND THE
FIRST HALF OF 2004.

SCHNEIDER: Two thousand three was a pretty broad-based rally, so growth and
value did fairly similarly. This year, the value indices have resumed their
outperformance of the earlier years of the decade, mostly because tech stocks
have lagged and they are more widely represented in the growth indices.

LAMCO: AND HOW IS THAT INFLUENCED BY CAPITALIZATION IN TERMS OF LARGE CAP,
MID-CAP AND SMALL CAP? IS THAT PRETTY MUCH TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD?

SCHNEIDER: Yes, it has just been an unbelievable five- to six-year period...
very consistent beginning in late 1998. Small caps have beat mid-caps, which
have beat large caps. We have been favorably disposed towards small cap stocks,
but their terrific outperformance over mid-caps and the mid-caps' outperformance
over large caps has narrowed the valuation gap. So, at least from a valuation
standpoint, the gap has been closed, although the market can sometimes carry
that beyond where it should go.

LAMCO: PERHAPS WE COULD CLOSE BY ASKING YOU TO DESCRIBE A COUPLE OF STOCKS THAT
ARE IN THE PORTION OF THE LIBERTY ALL-STAR EQUITY FUND PORTFOLIO THAT YOU MANAGE
AND WHY THEY EXEMPLIFY THE SCM APPROACH TO INVESTING.

[SIDENOTE]

"...WE TRY TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. SPENDING TIME ON THE PAST OR PRESENT SIMPLY
ISN'T PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE ALL OF THAT IS ALREADY FULLY DISCOUNTED IN THE
MARKETPLACE."

                                       10

SCHNEIDER: J. C. Penney has been one of our best stocks since we've been
managing for Liberty All-Star Equity Fund. It is a company that has been totally
transformed over the last two and one-half years under the leadership of
Chairman and CEO Allen Questrom. He has replaced virtually the entire executive
management of the company. It was a company that had become moribund and lost
its way--there was no vision or leadership. Questrom has brought in a plan and a
strategy and now the company has become a real leader, gaining market share
versus its competitors every year. Margins are in the process of moving from 2
percent in the department store division to the 6 to 7 percent range. It's just
a tremendous turnaround. The stock has more than doubled in a period where the
market has been relatively flat. This is a classic broken stock, not necessarily
a broken company. It has been completely revitalized under new leadership and is
now considered to be a very well run company. Now the stock is in favor, with a
couple of people recommending it when no one recommended it three years ago. So,
J.C. Penney is a stock that represents our style well.

LAMCO: WHERE DID QUESTROM COME FROM?

SCHNEIDER: He has a background with Federated Department Stores and Barney's, so
he has been in the retail business his whole career, and has a very strong track
record. Once again, he is achieving great results.

LAMCO: CAN YOU DESCRIBE ANOTHER STOCK?

SCHNEIDER: A second one would be Tyco International. Obviously, this is a
company that has been under a lot of press scrutiny, given the issues
surrounding former CEO Dennis Kozlowski, and it could be considered a
controversial stock. But, the fact is that it is a company with leadership
positions in most of its businesses and it generates strong free cash flow. The
old management was forced out under the scandal and Edward Breen came in from
Motorola to be chairman and CEO. He has a good reputation for operations, and
that's what the company needed because a lot of its divisions had lost their
way. And, even though the company had leadership positions in their industries,
many divisions were underperforming. Breen has instituted six sigma quality
programs and other initiatives to improve operations. Earnings were in the $1.25
range when we bought the stock and we believe that they should improve to over
$2 a share in the next couple of years. The stock has not jumped as much as J.
C. Penney but it has gone from the high teens to over $30 a share today. So, it
has been a good performer and, just like J. C. Penney, we think it has more
upside potential.

LAMCO: THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER INTERESTING INTERVIEW.

[SIDENOTE]

"...WE WILL HOLD SOME OF OUR WINNERS FOR FIVE YEARS OR LONGER. IF PRESSED, I
WOULD SAY THAT OUR SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENTS MOST OFTEN FALL INTO THE THREE- TO
FOUR-YEAR TIMEFRAME."

"WE'RE PRIMARILY A BOTTOM-UP STOCK PICKER. WE MOSTLY USE MACRO FACTORS TO KEEP
US AWAY FROM CERTAIN AREAS AS OPPOSED TO GUIDING US TOWARDS AREAS FOR
INVESTMENT."

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

I. ORGANIZATION

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (the "Fund"), is a Massachusetts business trust
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended, as
a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Fund seeks total investment return comprised of long-term capital
appreciation and current income through investing primarily in a diversified
portfolio of equity securities.

FUND SHARES

The Fund may issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest.

II. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Equity securities are valued at the last sale price at the close of the
principal exchange on which they trade. Unlisted securities or listed securities
for which there were no sales during the day are valued at the closing bid price
on such exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

    Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service approved by the
Fund's Board of Trustees (the "Board"), based upon market transactions for
normal, institutional-sized trading units of similar securities. The services
may use various pricing techniques, which will take into account appropriate
factors such as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading
characteristics and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for
which quotes are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange
bid quotation.

    Short-term debt obligations maturing in more than 60 days for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at current market value. Short-term
debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

    Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued
at fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures
approved by and under the general supervision of the Board.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with institutions that
the Fund's investment advisor has determined are creditworthy. The Fund, through
its custodian, receives delivery of underlying securities collateralizing a
repurchase agreement. Collateral is at least equal, at all times, to the value
of the repurchase obligation including interest. A repurchase agreement
transaction involves certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the
counterparty. These risks include possible delays or restrictions upon the
Fund's ability to dispose of the underlying securities and a possible decline in
the value of the underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to
assert its rights.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual

                                       26
<Page>

basis. Premium and discount are amortized and accreted, respectively, on all
debt securities. Corporate actions and dividend income are recorded on the
ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

Consistent with the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable income to shareholders, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund currently has a policy of paying distributions on its shares of
beneficial interest totaling approximately 10% of its net asset value per year.
The distributions are payable in four quarterly distributions of 2.5% of the
Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday
prior to each quarterly declaration date. Distributions to shareholders are
recorded on ex-date.

III. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2003
was as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                                <C>

                                                                   $ 91,197,064
</Table>

*For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions, if any, are considered
ordinary income distributions.

    The source of the distributions in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 are estimates and are subject to
change based on Fund activity through December 31, 2004, the Fund's fiscal
year-end.

IV. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

Liberty Asset Management Company ("LAMCO"), an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor of
the Fund. Prior to April 1, 2004, LAMCO was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Fund's investment advisor, was acquired by BOA. The
acquisition did not change the way the Fund is managed, the investment personnel
assigned to manage the Fund or the fees paid by the Fund.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia"), an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of BOA and an affiliate of LAMCO, is responsible for providing
pricing and bookkeeping services to the Fund under a pricing and bookkeeping
agreement. Under a separate agreement (the "Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia
has delegated those functions to State Street Corporation ("State Street").
Columbia pays the total fees collected from the Fund for the services to State
Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

    Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Fund, Columbia receives
from the Fund an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Fund's average weekly net assets exceed $50 million, an additional monthly
fee. The additional fee rate is calculated by taking into account the fees
payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to
the average daily net assets of the Fund for that month. The Fund also pays
additional fees for pricing services. For the six months ended June 30, 2004,
the annualized effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.020%.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. The Fund could have invested a portion of the
assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement in an income
producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS

The Fund pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
LAMCO or its affiliates.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Fund related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Fund paid $2,937 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Miscellaneous expense"
on the Statement of Operations.

V. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $460,068,509 and
$491,094,795, respectively.

VI. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS

During the six months ended June 30, 2004, and the year ended December 31, 2003,
distributions in the amount of $18,933,626 and $38,881,100, respectively, were
paid in newly issued shares valued at market value or net asset value, but not
less than 95% of market value. Such distributions resulted in the issuance of
2,094,335 and 4,584,918 shares, respectively.

VII. SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

RIGHTS OFFERING

In a rights offering commencing June 2004, shareholders were issued
non-transferable rights entitling them to subscribe for one additional share for
every ten shares held, with the right to subscribe for additional shares not
subscribed for by others in the primary subscription. The rights offering
expired on July 7, 2004. The Fund issued 15,841,927 shares at $8.34 per share,
which represented 95% of the net asset value on July 8, 2004. Total proceeds of
the offering amounted to $132,121,671. The issuance of shares at a discount to
NAV resulted in dilution to the NAV of $0.05 per share.

                                  DISTRIBUTION POLICY/DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's current policy, in effect since 1988, is to pay
distributions on its shares totaling approximately 10 percent of its net asset
value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2.5 percent of the
Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday
prior to each quarterly declaration date. THE FIXED DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT
RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE FUND'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME OR NET REALIZED
CAPITAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND MAY BE TAXED AS ORDINARY INCOME UP TO THE AMOUNT OF
THE FUND'S CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS. If, for any calendar
year, the total distributions made under the 10 percent pay-out policy exceed
the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will
generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the
shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares. If the Fund's net investment
income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount distributed
under the 10 percent pay-out policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and
not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the
extent of such excess. The Fund retained such excess gains in 1993, 1996 and
1997.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Through the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan, the
Fund's shareholders have the opportunity to have their dividends automatically
reinvested in additional shares of the Fund. Participants are kept apprised of
the status of their account through quarterly statements.

    For complete information and enrollment forms, please call Investor
Assistance toll-free at 1-800-LIB-FUND (1-800-542-3863) weekdays between 9 AM
and 5 PM Eastern Time. If your shares are held for you by a broker, bank or
other nominee, you should contact the institution holding your shares if you
wish to participate in the Plan.

10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities that

<Page>

may recommend nominees to the registrant's Board of Trustees/Directors since
those procedures were last disclosed in response to Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of
Schedule 14A.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

   (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
        officer, based on their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure
        controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing of
        this report, have concluded that such controls and procedures are
        adequately designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
        by the registrant in Form N-CSR is accumulated and communicated to the
        registrant's management, including the principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
        appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

        financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal
        half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an
        annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
        materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
        reporting.

I, William R. Parmentier, Jr., certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Liberty All-Star Equity Fund;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

     (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

          evaluation; and

     (c)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
