PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return assumes reinvestment of all dividends and
capital gains and excludes payment of maximum early withdrawal charge. An early
withdrawal charge for Class B shares of 3.00% will be imposed on most shares
accepted by the fund for repurchase within the first year after purchase and
declining thereafter to 0.00% after the fifth year. An early withdrawal charge
for Class C shares of 1.00% will be imposed on most shares accepted by the fund
for repurchase, which have been held for less than one year. Effective February
18, 2005, the Class B and Class C early withdrawal charge was terminated. (See
Note 12 in the Notes to Financial Statements.)

Fund Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund is managed by the Adviser's Senior Loans team, led
by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director of the Adviser.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The semiannual period ended January 31, 2005 saw a continuation of the favorable
backdrop for the senior-loan market that has prevailed for much of the last two
years. The economy maintained a path of healthy growth, inflation remained
modest, and the long-awaited increase in long-term interest rates failed to
materialize. All of these factors continued to support corporate financial
performance, which has been further aided by the strides in efficiency many
companies made over the past several years in response to an increasingly
competitive environment. The significant decline of the U.S. dollar over the
last two-plus years has provided an additional boost to the competitiveness of
many of the companies that underlie the senior loan market, as a weaker dollar
makes foreign goods more expensive to U.S. consumers and U.S. exports of
manufactured goods more competitive. The end result of strong corporate
profitability has been improving credit quality, which has supported the senior-
loan market's performance.

Yield spreads in the senior-loan market began the semiannual period near
historical lows and remained there throughout the period. These narrow spreads
continued to allow a greater range of companies to access the senior-loan market
at very favorable terms. At the same time, an expanding array of institutional
investors has been attracted to the asset class in view of its improved credit
quality, which has been reflected in significantly lower default rates. In fact,
while senior loans have traditionally been considered somewhat speculative,
there is growing appreciation of the asset class' defensive characteristics. As
a result, demand for and inflows into senior loans remained strong, and
investors readily absorbed the healthy supply of new issues that came to market
during the period. In both the primary and secondary markets, demand has
continued to outstrip supply, which has supported the continued narrowing of
spreads.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 2.58 percent for the six months ended January 31, 2005 (Class
B shares, unadjusted for sales charges).

We believe that the fund's performance over the period reflects the resources we
have dedicated to performing fundamental research and analysis on the companies
held in the portfolio. We continue to focus on identifying those companies that
exhibit strong management, solid and predictable cash flows, and collateral that
is sufficient to provide a healthy backstop in the event of default.

In addition to a strong focus on fundamental company analysis, we continued to
maintain a high level of diversification in the fund's portfolio during the
period in order to minimize the risk of over-concentration in any one sector or
security. We follow a bottom-up security-selection process and generally do not
practice sector rotation. However, we will move to limit the portfolio's
exposure to certain industries facing ongoing challenges. For example, we
continued to minimize the fund's exposure to the auto industry during the
period. We believe that as that industry continues the process of sorting out
the winners from the losers, the risks to auto manufacturers and their suppliers
dictate a cautious approach. We have followed a similar path in
telecommunications, which is experiencing ongoing problems with overcapacity. In
addition, within the healthcare sector, we have avoided exposure to companies
which rely on Medicare reimbursement rates for revenues. Federal budget
constraints put at risk the maintenance of existing reimbursement rates.

Looking ahead, while growth in corporate profits is showing signs of slowing, we
believe profitability and pricing power for the borrowers that underlie the
senior loan market may remain strong. As a result, we expect that these
companies will potentially be able to continue to generate free cash-flow and
that credit quality will not deteriorate in any meaningful way. For these
reasons, we believe the environment for senior loans may continue to be quite
favorable in the coming months. We will continue to pursue a disciplined
investment approach, that seeks to balance attractive yields with a relatively
stable net asset value for the fund.

There is no guarantee that any securities will continue to perform well or be
held by the fund in the future.

       public web site, www.vankampen.com. In addition to the semiannual and
       annual reports that Van Kampen delivers to shareholders and makes
       available through the Van Kampen public web site, each fund files a
       complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the fund's first
       and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q. Van Kampen does not deliver the
       reports for the first and third fiscal quarters to shareholders, nor are
       the reports posted to the Van Kampen public web site. You may, however,
       obtain the Form N-Q filings (as well as the Form N-CSR and N-CSRS
       filings) by accessing the SEC's web site, http://www.sec.gov. You may
       also review and copy them at the SEC's Public Reference Room in
       Washington, DC. Information on the operation of the SEC's Public
       Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-202-942-8090. You
       can also request copies of these materials, upon payment of a duplicating
       fee, by electronic request at the SEC's e-mail address
       (publicinfo@sec.gov) or by writing the Public Reference section of the
       SEC, Washington, DC 20549-0102.

       In addition to filing a complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the
       SEC each fiscal quarter, each Van Kampen fund makes portfolio holdings
       information available by periodically providing the information on its
       public web site, www.vankampen.com. Each Van Kampen fund provides a
       complete schedule of portfolio holdings on the public web site on a
       calendar-quarter basis approximately 30 days after the close of the
       calendar quarter. Furthermore, each Van Kampen fund provides partial
       lists of its portfolio holdings (such as top 10 or top 15 fund holdings)
       to the public web site each with a delay of approximately 15 days.

       You may obtain copies of a fund's fiscal quarter filings, or its monthly
       or calendar-quarter web site postings, by contacting Van Kampen Client
       Relations at 1-800-847-2424.

                                                                               5

ANNUAL HOUSEHOLDING NOTICE

       To reduce fund expenses, the fund attempts to eliminate duplicate
       mailings to the same address. The fund delivers a single copy of certain
       shareholder documents to investors who share an address, even if the
       accounts are registered under different names. The fund's prospectuses
       and shareholder reports (including annual privacy notices) will be
       delivered to you in this manner indefinitely unless you instruct us
       otherwise. You can request multiple copies of these documents by either
       calling 800-341-2911 or writing to Van Kampen Investor Services at 1
       Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181. Once Investor
       Services has received your instructions, we will begin sending individual
       copies for each account within 30 days.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

       A description of the fund's policies and procedures with respect to the
       voting of proxies relating to the fund's portfolio securities is
       available without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-847-2424. This
       information is also available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's
       website at http://www.sec.gov

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) All or a portion of this security is segregated in connection with unfunded
    loan commitments.

(b) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(c) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(d) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(e) This borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(f) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(g) Payment-in-kind security.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2005.

(i) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(j) Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(k) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 3.4%
    of the net assets of the Fund.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. The interest rates
    shown are those in effect at January 31, 2005. Senior Loans are generally
    considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is contractually
    obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or Borrower prior to
    the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. In June 2003, the Fund completed a
transaction in which it redesignated its shares issued before June 13, 2003 as
Class B Shares and issued new Class C Shares to the shareholders of Van Kampen
Senior Floating Rate Fund in exchange for the assets and liabilities of that
fund. Effective February 18, 2005, the Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund B and C share
classes were renamed Class IB and Class IC Shares, respectively. Also, effective
February 18, 2005, the Fund seeded new Class A, Class B and Class C Shares. (See
Note 12.)

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans are valued by the Fund following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Fund's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate redetermination period and
maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the
period until the next interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such
Senior Loans. Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial
paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate
securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the
Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by
the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

agreements, which are short-term investments in which the Fund acquires
ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the security at
a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for service
fees, which are applicable only to Class C shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2004, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $959,524,180, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

asset value of the shares on the expiration date of the tender offer. Effective
February 3, 2005, the Board of Trustees approved a new fundamental policy
whereby the Fund commits to make regular offers to repurchase shares of the
Fund. Initially, the Fund will be making quarterly offers to repurchase up to
15% of its then outstanding shares. The Fund is seeking exemptive relief from
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to enable the Fund to conduct
monthly repurchase offers. At present, the Fund expects that upon receiving such
exemptive relief, it would conduct monthly repurchase offers for 5% of its
outstanding shares. The Fund cannot guarantee that the SEC will grant exemptive
relief. There is no guarantee that you will be able to sell your Shares at any
given time. For the six months ended January 31, 2005, 21,615,729 shares were
tendered and repurchased by the Fund.

6. EARLY WITHDRAWAL CHARGE

An early withdrawal charge to recover offering expenses will be imposed in
connection with most Class B shares held for less than five years and Class C
shares held less than one year which are accepted by the Fund for repurchase
pursuant to tender offers. The early withdrawal charge will be payable to Van
Kampen. Any early withdrawal charge which is required to be imposed will be made
in accordance with the following schedule.

    The Fund has entered into a revolving credit agreement for an aggregate of
$300,000,000, which will terminate on November 12, 2005. The proceeds of any
borrowing by the Fund under the revolving credit agreement shall be used for
temporary liquidity purposes and funding of shareholder tender offers. Annual
commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of the credit line.
For the six months ended January 31, 2005, the Fund recognized commitment fee
expenses of approximately $257,900.

    Borrowings under this facility will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate
plus 1.00%. For the six months ended January 31, 2005, the average daily balance
of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement was $2,364,130 with a
weighted average interest rate of 2.44%.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At January 31, 2005, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation
basis.

9. SERVICE PLAN

For Class C, the Fund has adopted a Service Plan (the "Plan") designed to meet
the service fee requirements of the sales charge rule of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The Plan governs payments for personal
services and/or the maintenance of shareholder accounts.

    Annual fees under the Plan of .15% (.25% maximum) of average daily net
assets are accrued daily and paid monthly for Class C. Of this amount, Van
Kampen paid Morgan Stanley DW Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor, approximately
$53,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2005. Effective February 18, 2005,
the distributor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. ("Distributor") began waiving this
service fee. (See Note 12.)

10. LITIGATION

On September 28, 2001 and October 11, 2001, separate complaints were filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois each by a
shareholder of the Fund against the Fund, the Adviser, Van Kampen Funds Inc. and
certain directors and officers of the Fund. The respective complaints, framed as
class actions, allege misstatements and omissions in the Fund's registration
statements in violation of the federal securities laws. The separate complaints
were consolidated on or about December 15, 2001, and the class was certified on
or about August 26, 2002. The consolidated action is entitled Abrams et al. v.
Van Kampen Funds, Inc., et al., No. 01 C 7538 (N.D. Ill., Hart J.). The ultimate
outcome of this action is not presently determinable and no provision has been
made in the Fund's financial statements for the effect, if any, of this action.

11. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

12. OFFERING OF NEW SHARE CLASSES

On February 18, 2005, the Fund redesignated its Class B Shares issued before
February 18, 2005 as a new class of Shares designated Class IB Shares and
redesignated its Class C Shares

                                                                              41

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

issued before February 18, 2005 as a new class of Shares designated Class IC
Shares. On February 18, 2005, the Fund commenced offering new Class A Shares,
new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares (the new Class B Shares and new Class
C Shares have different fees, expenses and characteristics than the original
classes of Class B Shares and Class C Shares). The Class IB Shares and Class IC
Shares are not continuously offered. The only new Class IB Shares and Class IC
Shares to be issued after February 18, 2005 are those Class IB Shares and Class
IC Shares issued to satisfy dividend and capital gain reinvestments. Shares of
each of new Class A Shares, new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares are sold
at their offering price, which is based upon the net asset value per Share for
such class of Shares plus sales charges where applicable. New Class A Shares are
subject to an up front sales charge of up to 3.25%. There is no initial sales
charge or underwriting discount on purchases of new Class B and new Class C
Shares but such Shares are subject to early withdrawal charges which will be
made in accordance with the following schedule:

</Table>

    The Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares have no early withdrawal charges
(the early withdrawal schedule applicable to the former Class B Shares and
former Class C Shares outstanding on February 18, 2005 has been terminated).

    Effective February 18, 2005, the Fund has adopted a distribution plan (the
"Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its new Class A Shares, new Class B
Shares and new Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with Rule
12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as
if the Fund were an open-end investment company. The Fund also has adopted a
service plan (the "Service Plan") with respect to each of its new Class A
Shares, new Class B Shares, new Class C Shares and Class IC Shares. There is no
Distribution Plan or Service Plan for the Class IB Shares and no Distribution
Plan for the Class IC Shares. All service fees under the Service Plan applicable
to new Class A Shares, new Class B Shares, new Class C Shares and Class IC
Shares are currently being waived. Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan,
the Fund pays distribution fees in connection with the sale and distribution of
its Shares and service fees in connection with the provision of ongoing services
to shareholders of each such class and the maintenance of shareholder accounts.

    Under the Distribution Plan and the Service Plan, the Fund may spend up to a
total of 0.25%, 1.00% and 1.00% per year of the average daily net assets of new
Class A Shares, new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares, respectively. Due to
voluntary fee waivers by the Distributor, the aggregate distribution and service
fees are currently 0.00%, 0.75% and 0.75% per year of the average daily net
assets for new Class A Shares, new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares,
respectively. Annual fees under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan are
accrued daily. The net annual fees for new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares
are paid monthly.
