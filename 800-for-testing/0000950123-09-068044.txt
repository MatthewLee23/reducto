Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2009 (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited
liability  company on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware  and
is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),  as a
closed-end,   non-diversified,   management   investment  company.   The  Fund's
investment  objective is to generate  consistent  capital  appreciation over the
long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional
equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective
by allocating its assets  primarily  among  professionally  selected  investment
funds  ("Investment   Funds")  that  are  managed  by  experienced   third-party
investment  advisers  ("Portfolio  Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a
corporation  formed  under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  ("JPMorgan  Chase"),  is responsible for the allocation of
assets to various Investment Funds,  subject to policies adopted by the Board of
Directors (the "Board"). Ehrlich Associates, L.L.C., a limited liability company
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing  Member"),  serves
as the managing  member of the Fund.  The  Managing  Member is  registered  as a
commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission  ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York and an
affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the special  member of the Fund (the
"Special  Member").  The  Special  Member  is  entitled  to all  incentive-based
performance allocations, if any, from Members' accounts.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the United  States of America  requires  the  Investment
Manager to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
the financial  statements and  accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
Investment  Manager  as of the last day of each  month  in  accordance  with the
valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined  from time to time
pursuant to policies  established  by the Board.  The Fund's  investments in the
Investment  Funds  are  considered  to be  illiquid  and can  only  be  redeemed
periodically.  The  Board has  approved  procedures  pursuant  to which the Fund
values its  investments in Investment  Funds at fair value.  In accordance  with
these  procedures,  fair  value as of each  month-end  ordinarily  is the  value
determined as of such month-end for each  Investment Fund in accordance with the
Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies  and  reported at the time of the Fund's
valuation.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
as  determined by the  Investment  Manager  represents  the amount that the Fund
could  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an  Investment  Fund if the  Fund's
interest  were  redeemed  at the time of the  valuation,  based  on  information
reasonably  available at the time the valuation is made and that the  Investment
Manager  believes to be reliable.  In the unlikely event that an Investment Fund
does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,  the Investment
Manager would determine the fair value of such Investment Fund based on the most
recent  value  reported  by the  Investment  Fund,  as well any  other  relevant
information  available at the time the Investment Manager Fund values the Fund's
portfolio.  The values  assigned  to these  investments  are based on  available
information and do not necessarily  represent  amounts that might  ultimately be
realized,  as such amounts depend on future  circumstances and cannot reasonably
be determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated. However,
because of the inherent  uncertainty of valuation,  those  estimated  values may
differ  significantly  from the  values  that  would  have been used had a ready
market for the investments existed, and the differences could be significant.

Investments  in  Investment  Funds  with  a  value  of  $177,575,095   which  is
approximately  94.59% of the Fund's net assets at September 30, 2009,  have been
fair valued and are illiquid and restricted as to resale or transfer.

Some of the  Investment  Funds may invest  all or a portion  of their  assets in
investments  which  may be  illiquid.  Some of  these  investments  are  held in
so-called "side pockets",  sub funds within the Investment Funds,  which provide
for their separate  liquidation  potentially  over a much longer period than the
liquidity an investment  in the  Investment  Funds may provide.  Should the Fund
seek  to  liquidate  its  investment  in  an  Investment  Fund  which  maintains
investments in a side pocket arrangement or which holds substantially all of its
assets in illiquid securities, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its
investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such cases, during the
period  until the Fund is  permitted  to fully  liquidate  its  interest  in the
Investment Funds, the value of its investment could fluctuate.

Accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
("GAAP"),  establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods.
The three levels of inputs are as follows:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
                    for similar securities,  interest rates,  prepayment speeds,
                    credit risk, etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant  unobservable  inputs  (including the Fund's own
                    assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology  used for valuing  securities  are not  necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied
as a reduction of the  investment's  cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital.  Once the  investment's  cost is  received,  any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on
the   ex-dividend   date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  Investment  Fund
transactions  are  calculated  on the  identified  cost basis.  Investments  are
recorded on the effective date of the  subscription in the Investment  Fund. All
changes  in the  value  of the  Investment  Funds  are  included  as  unrealized
appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of Operations.

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business  other than those that the
Investment  Manager  assumes.  The  expenses  of the Fund  include,  but are not
limited  to,  the  following:  all  costs and  expenses  related  to  investment
transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and
auditing fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a  partnership  for
Federal  income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for the  payment of
Federal,  state  or local  income  taxes  has  been  provided.  Each  Member  is
individually  required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

The Investment  Manager evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing the Fund's financial statements to determine whether the
tax positions are  "more-likely-than-not"  of being  sustained by the applicable
tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the Fund level not deemed to
meet the "more-likely-than-not"  threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or
expense in the current year. The Investment Manager's  conclusions regarding tax
positions will be subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on
factors  including,   but  not  limited  to,  on-going  analyses  of  tax  laws,
regulations and interpretations thereof.

The Investment  Manager has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have
a material impact to the Fund's financial  statements.  However,  the Investment
Manager's  conclusions  regarding FIN 48 may be subject to review and adjustment
at a later  date  based  on  on-going  analyses  of tax  laws,  regulations  and
interpretations thereof and other factors.

G. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash  represents  cash and cash  equivalents  held at PFPC Trust Company  ("PFPC
Trust"), the Fund's custodian.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration
for such  management  services,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.1042% (approximately 1.25% on an annualized basis) and
an  additional  administrative  services  fee of 0.0125% per month  (0.15% on an
annualized basis) of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Expense  Limitation  Agreement"),  dated May 26,
2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary,  reimburse  expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the  Agreement  is in place so that the  total  operating  expenses  of the Fund
(excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary  expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive Allocation)
do not exceed  2.30% on an  annualized  basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each  month.  Under the  Expense  Limitation  Agreement,  any  waivers or
reimbursements  made by the  Investment  Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement  is made,  provided that  repayment  does not result in the Fund's
aggregate  operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense  limitations.  For
the period ended  September  30,  2009,  the Funds'  operating  expenses did not
exceed  the  expense  limitation.  The Fund  did not  reimburse  the  Investment
Manager,  and the Investment  Manager did not pay for any expenses on the Fund's
behalf.

The Fund has entered into an administration agreement with PNC Global Investment
Servicing (U.S.), Inc. ("PNC"),  whereby PNC provides fund accounting,  investor
services  and  transfer  agency  functions  for the Fund.  As  compensation  for
services  set forth  herein  that are  rendered  by PNC  during the term of this
Agreement,  the Fund pays PNC an annual fee ranging from 0.035% to 0.075% of the
Fund's  average  net  assets,   with  a  minimum   monthly  fee  of  $6,250  for
administration and accounting, an annual fee of 0.015% of the Fund's average net
assets,  with a minimum  monthly  fee of $3,334  for  regulatory  administration
services,  and an annual  fee for Member  services  of $150 per  Member,  with a
minimum  monthly fee of $1,000.  For the six months  ended  September  30, 2009,
administration fees totaled $183,594, of which none were waived.

PFPC Trust  serves as  custodian  of the Fund's  assets and  provides  custodial
services to the Fund. As compensation for services,  the Fund pays PFPC Trust an
annual fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average gross assets,  with a minimum monthly
fee of $795.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The  Independent  Directors  are each paid an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus
reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in  consideration  for their  attendance  at
meetings of the Board, and any committees  thereof,  and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

4. LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time,  the Fund may borrow  cash from a major  institution  under a
credit  agreement  up to a maximum  of $8  million.  Interest  is payable on any
outstanding  balance at PRIME plus Margin (0.00%) or LIBOR plus Margin  (1.85%).
During the six months ended  September 30, 2009,  there were no borrowings,  and
there was no loan payable  outstanding  on September 30, 2009.  Credit  facility
fees  incurred for the six months ended  September 30, 2009 amounted to $32,533,
which is included in other expenses in the Statement of Operations

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate  purchases  and sales of  Investment  Funds for the six  months  ended
September 30, 2009 amounted to $48,916,130 and $29,476,708, respectively.

At September 30, 2009, the estimated cost of investments  for Federal income tax
purposes  was  substantially  the  same  as the  cost  for  financial  reporting
purposes.   Accordingly,   gross  unrealized  appreciation  on  investments  was
$19,483,956 and gross unrealized  depreciation was $8,858,882,  resulting in net
unrealized appreciation of $10,625,074.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscription  for  interests  by  eligible
investors  may be  accepted  at such times as the Fund may  determine.  The Fund
reserves the right to reject any  subscriptions  for interests in the Fund.  The
initial  acceptance  for  subscriptions  for  Interests  was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial  Closing Date,  the Fund generally
accepts subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times, and in such
amounts,  and on such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Board,  in its sole
discretion.  The Investment  Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase  Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September,  and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee payable to the Fund
will be charged for  repurchases of Members'  Interests at any time prior to the
day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a Member's purchase of its
Interests.  For the six  months  ended  September  30,  2009,  the fund  charged
repurchase fees totaling $13,281 to Members.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

At the end of each Allocation  Period of the Fund, any net capital  appreciation
or net capital  depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized),  as the
case  may  be,  is  allocated  to the  capital  accounts  of all of the  Members
(including  the Special  Member and the Managing  Member) in proportion to their
respective  opening capital account  balances for such  Allocation  Period.  The
initial  "Allocation  Period"  began on the  Initial  Closing  Date,  with  each
subsequent  Allocation  Period  beginning  immediately  after  the  close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the  last  day of each  month,  (2) the  date  immediately  prior  to the
effective  date of (a) the  admission  of a new Member or (b) an  increase  in a
Member's  capital  contribution,  (3) the  effective  date of any  repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar  year,  each Member's  return on investment  for the
year is determined  and a portion of the net capital  appreciation  allocated to
each Member's  capital account during the year (the  "Performance  Allocation"),
net of the  Member's  allocable  share  of the  Management  Fee and the  Manager
Administrative  Services  Fee,  equal to 10% of the  portion of such net capital
appreciation  that  exceeds  the  Preferred  Return (as  defined  below) will be
reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member. The "Preferred Return"
is equal to the 3-month  U.S.  Treasury  Bill yield (as defined  below) for each
month during the relevant  calendar year (or any shorter period of calculation).
The "3-month U.S.  Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal one-twelfth of
the annual yield for the 3-month U.S.  Treasury Bill for the first  business day
of the then current  calendar  quarter as set forth in the U.S.  Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant  maturities",
or if such  measurement  is not  available,  such other  source as the  Managing
Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.

Prior  to April  1,  2005  the  performance  allocation  was  calculated  in the
following  manner:  (1)  net  capital  appreciation  up to a 6%  return  remains
allocated to each Member (the"Preferred  Return");  (2) net capital appreciation
in excess of the Preferred  Return is reallocated to the Special Member until it
has  been  allocated  the  next  0.30%  of  return  (the  "Catch-Up");  and  (3)
thereafter,  95% of any net  capital  appreciation  in excess  of the  Preferred
Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member,  and the remaining 5%
of such net capital appreciation is reallocated to the Special Member.

No Performance  Allocation is made, however,  with respect to a Member's capital
account until any cumulative net capital  depreciation  previously  allocated to
such   Member's   capital   account  plus  any   Management   Fees  and  Manager
Administrative   Service  Fees  charged  to  such  capital  account  (the  "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately  to reflect  the  repurchase  of any  portion  of that  Member's
Interest.  Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at the end of a calendar
year) from a Member,  a Performance  Allocation will be determined and allocated
to the Special Member,  and in the case of any repurchase of a partial Interest,
on a "first in - first out" basis  (i.e.,  the  portion  of the  Interest  being
repurchased (and the amount with respect to which the Performance  Allocation is
calculated)   will  be  deemed  to  have  been  taken  from  the  first  capital
contribution  of such Member (as such  contribution  has been  adjusted  for net
capital  appreciation or depreciation,  Management Fees, Manager  Administrative
Services  Fees and other  expenses)  until it is decreased to zero and from each
subsequent  capital  contribution  until  such  contribution  (as  adjusted)  is
decreased to zero).

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

For the period September 30, 2009, $3,268 was reallocated to the capital account
of the Special Member in connection  with  repurchases of interests.  Based upon
profits for the six months ended  September 30, 2009, the  additional  Incentive
Allocation  that would be  reallocated  to the Special  Member is $86,096.  This
amount is subject to change as  Incentive  Allocations  occur at the end of each
calendar year and on repurchases of Interests.

7. RISK EXPOSURE

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance   sheet  risk.   These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,
short-selling activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,
and interest rate,  credit default and total return equity swaps contracts.  The
Fund's  risk of loss in these  Investment  Funds is  limited to the value of the
investments in the Funds.

In pursuing its investment objectives, the Fund invests in Investment Funds that
are not  registered  under  the 1940 Act.  These  Investment  Funds may  utilize
diverse  investment   strategies,   which  are  not  generally  managed  against
traditional  investment indices.  The Investment Funds selected by the Fund will
invest in and actively trade securities and other financial  instruments using a
variety of strategies and  investment  techniques  that may involve  significant
risks.  Such risks  arise  from the  volatility  of the  equity,  fixed  income,
commodity  and  currency  markets,  leverage  both  on  and  off  balance  sheet
associated  with  borrowings,   short  sales  and  derivative  instruments,  the
potential illiquidity of certain instruments including emerging markets, private
transactions,  derivatives,  and counterparty and broker defaults. Various risks
are also associated with an investment in the Fund,  including risks relating to
the  multi-manager  structure  of  the  Fund,  risks  relating  to  compensation
arrangements and risks related to limited liquidity of the units. The Investment
Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually, and may
be subject to various lock-up provisions and early withdrawal fees.

The   investments  of  the  Investment   Funds  are  subject  to  normal  market
fluctuations  and other risks  inherent in investing in securities and there can
be no  assurance  that  any  appreciation  in value  will  occur.  The  value of
investments  can fall as well as rise and  investors  may not realize the amount
that they invest.

Although the Investment  Manager will seek to select Investment Funds that offer
the  opportunity  to have their  shares or units  redeemed  within a  reasonable
timeframe,  there can be no assurance  that the liquidity of the  investments of
such Investment Funds will always be sufficient to meet redemption  requests as,
and when, made.

The  Investment  Manager may invest the Fund's assets in  Investment  Funds that
invest in illiquid securities and do not permit frequent  withdrawals.  Illiquid
securities owned by Investment Funds are riskier than liquid securities  because
the  Investment  Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid  securities if
their  investment  performance  deteriorates,  or may be able to  dispose of the
illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price. Similarly,  the illiquidity
of the  Investment  Funds  may  cause  Members  to incur  losses  because  of an
inability  to  withdraw  their  investments  from the Fund  during or  following
periods of negative performance.

Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2009 (unaudited) (concluded)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. RISK EXPOSURE (CONTINUED)

The  Investment  Funds may invest in the  securities of foreign  companies  that
involve special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing
in U.S. companies. These risks include devaluation of currencies,  less reliable
information  about  issuers,  different  securities  transaction  clearance  and
settlement  practices,  and future adverse political and economic  developments.
Moreover,  securities  of many foreign  companies  and their markets may be less
liquid and their prices more volatile than those  securities of comparable  U.S.
companies.

The Investment Funds may also invest in derivatives  which represent  agreements
between the Investment Fund and a counterparty.  Such agreements,  which include
forward contracts,  non-exchange-traded  options and swaps, usually represent an
agreement  between  two  parties to either  receive  or pay monies  equal to the
difference between a selective value or market rate and/or  corresponding  value
or market value ("Reference  Rates") upon the termination of an agreement.  Such
transactions can be effected on a leveraged basis which may amplify the positive
or negative outcome of the change in Reference Rates.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of  representations  that provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management  has  evaluated  all  subsequent  transactions  and events  after the
balance sheet date through November 27, 2009, the date of filing,  and except as
already included in the notes to these financial statements, has determined that
no additional items require disclosure.
