                           Franklin Templeton Investments

                           GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE


                           Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure
                           combines the specialized expertise of three
                           world-class investment management groups--Franklin,
                           Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE      Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                           autonomously, relying on its own research and staying
                           true to the unique investment disciplines that
                           underlie its success.

                           FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a leader in
                           tax-free investing and a driving force in fixed
                           income investing around the globe. They also bring
                           expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                           investing.

                           TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                           international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                           has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                           with research offices in over 25 countries, they
                           offer investors the broadest global reach in the
                           industry.

                           MUTUAL SERIES. Established in 1949, Mutual Series is
                           dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                           searching aggressively for opportunity among
                           undervalued stocks, arbitrage situations and
                           distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION       Because our management groups work independently and
                           adhere to distinctly different investment approaches,
                           Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically
                           have a low overlap of securities. That's why our
                           funds can be used to build truly diversified
                           portfolios covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST  At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                           consistently provide investors with exceptional
                           risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                           the reliable account services that have helped us
                           become one of the most trusted names in financial
                           services.

Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Templeton Dragon Fund covers the period ended December
31, 2003.


PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the year ended December 31, 2003, Templeton Dragon Fund delivered a +108.44%
cumulative total return in market price terms and +76.54% in net asset value
terms, as shown in the Performance Summary on page 6.


ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Despite a temporary setback resulting from the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) outbreak early in the year, China's economy recorded robust gross
domestic product (GDP) growth of 9.1% in 2003.(1) Trade also continued to
prosper as 2003 exports and imports jumped 35% and 40% compared with 2002.(2)
The mainland's attraction to multinational companies and strong economic growth
continued to stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) during the period. FDI
inflows totaled a record US$53.5 billion for 2003, a 1.4% increase over 2002.(3)
To ease pressure on the government to revalue the local currency, China relaxed
controls on overseas companies' investments.

Tensions between Taiwan and China heightened once again during the fourth
quarter as Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian stressed that Taiwan was an
independent, sovereign country and proposed holding a referendum during
presidential elections in March 2004 where Chen will seek re-election. The
proposed referendum centers on the issues of support of the one-country
principle, whether Taiwan

should buy more anti-missile weapons if China refused to withdraw its missiles
pointed at Taiwan, and whether Taipei should open talks with Beijing. China has
repeatedly stressed that the island must unify with the mainland or face war.
Taiwan's economy, in terms of GDP, is expected to grow 3.2% in 2003 and 4.1% in
2004.(4) Taiwanese exports rose 10.4% to US$144.2 billion in 2003, while imports
increased 13.1% to US$127.3 billion over the same time.(5)

Hong Kong's economy bounced back in the latter half of 2003, leading third
quarter GDP growth to rebound to 4.0% annualized after a poor second quarter,
with the Hong Kong government forecasting 3.0% growth for calendar year 2003.(6)
Unemployment rose to a high of 8.7% in 2003, reflecting the negative impact SARS
had on tourism, retail and service sectors, primarily.(6) As the scenario
improved toward the latter half of the year, unemployment dropped to 7.5% by the
end of November.(6) On another positive note, Hong Kong and China signed a
free-trade agreement at the end of June, an indication of China's opening its
economy to international competition.

Markets in the greater China region underperformed their emerging markets
counterparts in the first part of the year due to the SARS outbreak. However,
Chinese markets rebounded strongly after the containment of the virus. Bargain
investors then returned in search of oversold stocks and, as reflected in the
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) China Free Index, these markets
returned 87.6% in U.S.-dollar terms for the year ended December 31, 2003.(7)


INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
which we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, such as price/earnings
ratios, operating profit margins and liquidation values, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.


MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's overweighted positions, relative to the MSCI China Free Index, in
Tsingtao Brewery, Sinopec Beijing Yanhua Petrochemical and China Petroleum &
Chemical provided a strong boost to the Fund's total return this year, as did
our position in China Mobile. However, our overweighted Taiwanese positions in
Sinopac Holdings and Altek Corporation worked against it. Consistent with our
strategy, we continued to hold Sinopac Holdings because we believe that as a
provider of a comprehensive range of financial products and services the company
could benefit from the consolidation of Taiwan's banking industry. Similarly, we
believe Altek, one of the world's largest manufacturers of digital cameras,
could benefit from growing global demand for its products.

By industry, the Fund's holdings in beverages, wireless telecommunication
services, and food and staples retailing sectors yielded the greatest
contribution relative to the MSCI China Free Index during the year. China Mobile
was the strongest contributor among our wireless telecommunication services
stocks; Hong Kong's Dairy Farm International generated positive results among
food and staples retailing stocks; and China H share Tsingtao Brewery led
performance in the beverages sector and was sold during the period as gains were
realized. On the negative side, an overweighted position in real estate stocks
and an underweighting in automobiles dampened performance, as real estate
underperformed and automobiles outperformed the MSCI China Free Index.

In May, the Fund completed a tender offer and bought back a total 6,656,425
shares of its common stock. The purchase was funded primarily by decreasing


4 |  Annual Report

<PAGE>

certain stock holdings that we believed were less attractively valued. During
the year, war and its aftermath in Iraq, ongoing geopolitical upheaval and fear
of SARS brought significant price movements to many financial markets,
especially in the first half of 2003. These developments, coupled with changes
in fundamentals for some companies held by the Fund, were some of the major
factors behind the portfolio changes.

During the year under review, consistent with our strategy we decreased the
Fund's exposure to China H shares (Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies), as we
believed some valuations grew expensive after the market's recent strong
performance. Key sales included Tsingtao Brewery, China Shipping Development and
shares of Zhejiang Expressway and Jiangsu Expressway. The Fund still held 29.5%
of total net assets in China H shares as of December 31, 2003. A key purchase
during the year included Red Chip stock China Mobile, a dominant wireless
telecommunications operator in China we believed to be well positioned to
benefit from China's ongoing economic expansion.

We increased the Fund's exposure to Taiwan due to the emergence of attractive
valuations, as we believed some stocks had become oversold due to concerns over
the SARS outbreak. There were also signs of global recovery within the
technology sector, Taiwan's largest market sector. Key purchases included Acer,
a major player in the global personal computer market; Delta Electronics, the
world's largest notebook PC adapter manufacturer; and additional shares of
Sunplus Technology, an integrated circuit design company specializing in
consumer products components.

We thank you for your interest in Templeton Dragon Fund, welcome your questions
and comments and look forward to serving your investment needs in the years
ahead.

ENDNOTES

ONGOING MARKET VOLATILITY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCE; MORE
RECENT RETURNS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE SHOWN. SPECIAL RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
FOREIGN INVESTING, INCLUDING CURRENCY VOLATILITY, ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTRIES WHERE THE FUND INVESTS. EMERGING
MARKETS INVOLVE HEIGHTENED RISKS RELATED TO THE SAME FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO
THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND LESSER LIQUIDITY. ALSO, AS
A NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT COMPANY INVESTING IN "CHINA COMPANIES," THE FUND
MAY INVEST IN A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF ISSUERS AND, AS A RESULT, BE SUBJECT
TO A GREATER RISK OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. SINCE
MARKETS CAN GO DOWN AS WELL AS UP, INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. The
Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing at least 45% of its total
assets in the equity securities of "China companies," as defined in the Fund's
prospectus.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange or NASDAQ are
valued at the last reported sales price. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of the
latest quoted bid and asked prices. Investments in open-end mutual funds are
valued at the closing net asset value. Foreign securities are valued at the
close of trading of the foreign exchange or the NYSE, whichever is earlier. If
events occur that materially affect the values of securities after the prices or
foreign exchange rates are determined, or if market quotations are not readily
available, the securities will be valued at fair value as determined following
procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes, and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included
in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Certain income from foreign securities is recorded as soon as information is
available to the Fund. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.



                                                              Annual Report | 15

2. CAPITAL STOCK

On October 18, 1997, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
implement an open-market share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may
purchase, from time to time, up to 5.4 million shares of the Fund's common stock
in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management (approximately 10%
of the shares outstanding at the time the program was initially implemented). In
May 2000, the Board of Directors removed the 10% limitation on share repurchases
in order to give management greater flexibility to engage in an aggressive share
repurchase program. Effective May 10, 2002, the Board of Directors discontinued
the repurchase program.

At December 31, 2003, there were 100 million shares authorized ($.01 par value).

On July 11, 2002 and May 22, 2003, the Fund purchased and retired certain
amounts of its outstanding common stock. The Fund incurred tender costs, which
were charged to additional paid-in-capital. Tender offer transactions were as
follows:

                                         ---------------------------------
                                          MAY 22, 2003*     JULY 11, 2002
                                         ---------------------------------

Shares repurchased and retired .........    6,656,425         4,364,926
Purchase price .........................        $9.97             $9.45
Percentage of net asset value ..........        92.5%               90%
Tender costs incurred ..................     $167,136          $242,221

*See Note 8 regarding Recent Litigation


3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers or directors of Templeton Asset
Management Ltd. (TAML) and Franklin Templeton Services, LLC (FT Services), the
Fund's investment manager and administrative manager, respectively.

The Fund pays an investment management fee to TAML of 1.25% per year of the
average weekly net assets of the Fund. The Fund pays FT Services an
administrative fee of 0.15% per year of the Fund's average weekly net assets, of
which 0.10% is paid to Nomura Asset Management, Inc., for sub-administrative
services.


4. INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2003, the cost of investments, net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation), and undistributed ordinary income for income tax purposes were
as follows:

Cost of investments .....................................   $427,257,882
                                                            --------------
Unrealized appreciation .................................    225,925,227
Unrealized depreciation .................................    (10,631,101)
                                                            --------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ..............   $215,294,126
                                                            --------------

4. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, was as follows:

                                     -------------------------
                                        2003         2002
                                     -------------------------

Distributions paid from:
 Ordinary income .................   $21,136,146   $7,570,574

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions.

Net realized gains and losses differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatment of wash sales and foreign currency
transactions.

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had tax basis capital losses of $45,572,045 which
may be carried over to offset future capital gains. Such losses expire in 2009.


5. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of securities (excluding short-term securities) for the year
ended December 31, 2003 aggregated $139,926,322 and $190,359,489, respectively.


6. HOLDINGS OF 5% VOTING SECURITIES OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES

The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines "affiliated companies" to include
investments in portfolio companies in which the Fund owns 5% or more of the
outstanding voting securities. Investments in "affiliated companies" at December
31, 2003 were as shown below.

On January 29, 2003, the Fund, together with Templeton China World Fund, Inc.
("China Fund"), another closed-end management investment company in Franklin
Templeton Investments, and TAML, the investment adviser to the Fund and China
Fund, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, Northern Division, against Harvard College, Harvard Management
Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor to Harvard
College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management (referred to
collectively as "Harvard"). The complaint alleged that Harvard violated several
provisions of the Federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC related to
Harvard's ownership of Fund shares and actions as a shareholder. On February 7,
2003, Harvard counterclaimed, alleging that the Fund, China Fund, TAML and each
fund's directors violated certain provisions of the Federal securities laws and
SEC rules. Harvard also asserted counterclaims of breach of fiduciary duty under
Maryland state law against TAML and each fund's directors. On March 20, 2003,
the parties announced a settlement of their claims.

DISMISSAL OF LAWSUIT. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Fund and
Harvard, the complaint brought by the Fund, China Fund and TAML against Harvard,
as well as the counterclaims brought by Harvard against the Fund, China Fund,
each fund's directors and TAML were dismissed without prejudice. The parties
have also entered into covenants not to sue each other with respect to the
claims that were made or could have been made in the litigation absent a breach
of the settlement agreements.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. As part of the settlement, Harvard College agreed to
withdraw all of its shareholder proposals for the Fund's 2003 Annual
Shareholders' meeting (the "Meeting.")

8. RECENT LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

TENDER OFFERS. The Fund announced that as part of its settlement with Harvard,
it agreed to take, and the Board approved, the following actions:

o  APRIL 2003 CASH TENDER OFFER--The Fund agreed to commence a cash tender
   offer, which was required to be commenced on or prior to April 30, 2003, for
   15% of the Fund's outstanding shares at 92.5% of net asset value per share as
   of the date the offer expires. Previously, the Board had approved an April
   2003 cash tender offer for not less than 10% of the Fund's outstanding shares
   at not less than 90% of net asset value per share. On April 24, 2003, the
   Fund commenced a tender offer for up to 6,656,425 shares, or 15%, of the
   Fund's outstanding shares at a price per share equal to 92.5% of net asset
   value per share as of May 22, 2003, the expiration date of the tender offer.
   In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, 6,656,425 shares were
   accepted by the Fund for a purchase price of $9.97 per share.

o  IN-KIND TENDER OFFERS--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an exemptive order
   allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic tender offers, each for up
   to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price equal to 95% of net asset
   value per share as of the date the offer expires, to be paid entirely in kind
   through a pro rata distribution of marketable portfolio securities and
   available cash. Subject to certain conditions, the settlement requires the
   Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for 20% of the Fund's shares
   within three months after obtaining the SEC exemption. The Fund may also be
   required under the settlement to conduct, on substantially identical terms,
   up to two additional in-kind tender offers under certain circumstances. There
   is no assurance that the SEC will issue the exemptive order, nor is it
   possible to predict the date when an exemptive order might be granted.

o  ADDITIONAL CASH TENDER OFFERS--If the SEC does not issue the exemptive order
   for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the settlement provides that the
   Fund may, but is not obligated to, conduct an additional cash tender offer,
   and possibly later follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15% of the Fund's
   outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per share as of the
   date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if the Fund does not
   conduct these tender offers, Harvard will be relieved of its obligation to
   refrain from making shareholder proposals and taking other actions with
   respect to the Fund.

Harvard announced that it intends to tender all of the shares it then owns into
each tender offer described above that is commenced.

The Settlement Agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.



                                                              Annual Report | 19

8. RECENT LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, nor to encourage others to
do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any time to
acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or similar
investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Fund agreed that TAML would be responsible for the
legal fees and expenses incurred by the Fund and its directors with respect to
the Settlement Agreement and the litigation. The Fund agreed that TAML would
also be responsible for the legal fees and expenses incurred by the Fund through
March 20, 2003, with respect to its proxy contest relating to the Meeting.


9. REGULATORY MATTERS

On February 4, 2004, the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an administrative complaint against
Franklin Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company"),
alleging violations of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act. The complaint
arises from activity that occurred in 2001 during which time an officer of a
Company subsidiary was negotiating an agreement with an investor relating to
investments in a mutual fund and a hedge fund.

The Fund, in addition to other entities within Franklin Templeton Investments,
including the Company and other funds, has been named in shareholder class
actions related to the matter described above. The Fund's management believes
that the claims made in the lawsuit are without merit and it intends to defend
vigorously against the allegations. It is anticipated that the Fund may be named
in additional similar civil actions related to the matter described above.

In addition, as part of ongoing investigations by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of
California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney General, the
U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the Florida Department of
Financial Services, and the Commissioner of Securities and the Attorney General
of the State of West Virginia, relating to certain practices in the mutual fund
industry, including late trading, market timing and sales compensation
arrangements, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current or
former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for
information and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and
its current employees are providing documents and information in response to
these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to requests
for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the
foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management
business.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

The Staff of the SEC has informed the Company that it intends to recommend that
the Commission authorize an action against an affiliate of the Fund's adviser
and a senior executive officer relating to the frequent trading issues that are
the subject of the SEC's investigation. These issues were previously disclosed
as being under investigation by government authorities and the subject of an
internal inquiry by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and on its
public website. The Company currently is in discussions with the SEC Staff in an
effort to resolve the issues raised in their investigation. Such discussions are
preliminary and the Fund management has been advised that the Company cannot
predict the likelihood of whether those discussions will result in a settlement
and, if so, the terms of such settlement. The impact, if any, of these matters
on the Fund is uncertain at this time. If the Company finds that it bears
responsibility for any unlawful or improper conduct, it has committed to making
the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

material respects, the financial position of Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the

ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the

the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN


The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Securities Trust Company (the "Plan Agent") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Agent must receive
written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Agent, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per month, for
the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments shall be made
by check or money order payable to "Mellon Securities Trust Company" and sent to
Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attn:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Agent shall apply such payments (less a
$5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to purchases of
the Fund's shares in the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Agent sent to Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box
3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Agent; or, if the participant wishes, the Plan
Agent will sell the participant's shares and send the proceeds, less a service
charge of $5.00 and less trading fees.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

Effective April 23, 2004, the fees for the sale of shares through the Plan will
be $15.00 per transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee. All other terms
and conditions of the Plan remain in effect and have not been modified or
amended.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)


Under Section 854(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund hereby
designates up to maximum of $4,789,102 as qualified dividends for purposes of
the maximum rate under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003. In January 2004, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV
which will include their share of qualified dividends distributed during the
calendar year 2003. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors
for information on the treatment of these amounts on their individual income tax
returns.

At December 31, 2003, more than 50% of the Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.'s total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from dividends paid to the Fund on these
investments. As shown in the table below, the Fund hereby designates to
shareholders the foreign source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to
Section 853 of the Internal Revenue Code. This designation will allow
shareholders of record on December 31, 2003, to treat their proportionate share
of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid directly by them. The
shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year
in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of Foreign Tax
Paid, Foreign Source Income, Foreign Qualified Dividends and Adjusted Foreign
Source Income as designated by the Fund, to shareholders of record. As a service
to individual shareholders filing Form 1116, "Adjusted Foreign Source Income per
Share" in column 4 below reports foreign source income with the required
adjustments to foreign source qualified dividends. This information is provided
to simplify your reporting of foreign source income for line 1 of Form 1116.

Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit or deduction (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a
minimum of 16 days during the 30-day period beginning 15 days before the
ex-dividend date of the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate).

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends without adjustment for the lower U.S.
tax rates. Generally, this is the foreign source income to be reported by
certain trusts and corporate shareholders.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)


Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. If you are an individual shareholder who
does not meet the qualified dividend holding period requirements, you may find
this information helpful to calculate the foreign source income adjustment
needed to complete line 1 of Form 1116.

Adjusted Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 4) is the adjusted amount per
share of foreign source income the Fund paid to you. These amounts reflect the
Foreign Source Income reported in column 2 adjusted for the tax rate
differential on foreign source qualified dividends that may be required for
certain individual shareholders pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 904(b)(2)(B).
If you are an individual shareholder who meets the qualified dividend holding
period requirements, generally, these Adjusted Foreign Source Income amounts may
be reported directly on line 1 of Form 1116 without additional adjustment.

In January 2004, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2003. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has been
reduced to take into account the tax rate differential on foreign source
qualified dividend income pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 904(b)(2)(B).
Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for information on the
treatment of these amounts on their 2003 individual income tax returns.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS    N/A


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Ltd. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors and employees of the Fund, the manager and the Proxy
Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with
the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved in
the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of directors, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as they align their interests with those of shareholders. The manager
will review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies
on expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes
in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation in connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR.

                                                        EXHIBIT (A)

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code")/1/ is for the investment  companies within
the complex  registered with the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

   o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
     relationships;

   o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
     documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other
     public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

   o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

   o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
     person or persons identified in the Code; and

   o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
    INTEREST OVERVIEW.

     A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private interest
interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the FT Funds. For example,
a conflict of  interest  would  arise if a Covered  Officer, or a member of his
family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with the
FT Funds.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships  between
Covered Officers  and the FT Funds and  already are subject  to conflict  of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund  administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three),  be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers may also be officers or employees of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code,  but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly before the
interest of the FT Funds. Each Covered Officer must:

   o Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
     influence  investment decisions or financial  reporting  by the FT Funds
     whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
     the FT Funds;

   o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
     individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
     the FT Funds;

   o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
     Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
     are made in good faith;

   o Report at least annually the following affiliations or  other
     relationships:/2/

   o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
     required to file reports with the SEC;

   o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
     directors;

   o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
     accounting firm; and

   o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund that
     will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from the advisory,
     sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with  affiliates  of
     Franklin Resources).

   There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3/:

  o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

  o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

  o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT
    Funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such
    entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
    time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
    impropriety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must
    obtain prior approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of
    $1000.

  o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
    with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
    adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
    thereof;

  o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
    charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
    transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
    arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
    equity ownership.

    FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

   o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
     requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

   o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
     to  misrepresent,  facts  about the FT Funds to others,  whether  within or
     outside the FT Funds,  including to the FT Funds'  directors  and auditors,
     and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

   o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
     responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
     the adviser and the  administrator  with the goal of promoting full,  fair,
     accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents
     the FT  Funds  file  with,  or  submit  to,  the  SEC and in  other  public
     communications made by the FT Funds; and

   o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote  compliance
     with the standards and  restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules and
     regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

   Each Covered Officer must:

   o Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as  applicable, upon becoming a
     Covered  Officer), affirm in writing to the Board  that he has  received,
     read, and understands the Code (see  Exhibit  B);

   o Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied  with the
     requirements of the Code; and

   o Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he
     knows of any violation of this Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself  is a
     violation of this Code.

     FT's  General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation./4/
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

   o FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
     action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;

   o If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy  General
     Counsel  believes that no violation has occurred,  FT's General  Counsel is
     not required to take any further action;

   o Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes
     is a  violation  will be reported to the Independent Directors  of the
     appropriate FT Fund;

   o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred,  it
     will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the  appropriate
     Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of,
     and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
     notification to appropriate  personnel of the investment adviser or its
     board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

   o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
     appropriate; and

   o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
     disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted  by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures  of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code.  The FT Code of Ethics and Policy  Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority  vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.




- ---------------------

1. Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered  management  investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted  such a code of ethics,  it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant  must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet  website and
disclose,  in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet  website;  or (3)  undertake in
its most recent  report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person  without  charge,
upon  request,  a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such  request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit  waivers)  from,  a provision  of the code in the  registrant's  annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose  amendments  and waivers by posting such  information on
its  website,  it will be  required to disclose  its  Internet  address and this
intention.

2. Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing  the Directors  and Officers  Questionnaire  and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel.

3. Any  activity or  relationship  that would  present a conflict  for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
of the Covered  Officer's  immediate  family  engages in such an activity or has
such a  relationship.  The Cover Person should also obtain  written  approval by
FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4. FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate,  with members of the Audit  Committee,  counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent  Directors,  and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR  defines  "waiver" as "the  approval by the  registrant of a material
departure  from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit  waiver," which
must also be  disclosed,  as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a
reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the
code of  ethics  that  has  been  made  known to an  executive  officer"  of the
registrant.
