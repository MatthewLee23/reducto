GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized leader in fixed income
investing and also brings expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style of
value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the year under review, Templeton Global Income Fund delivered cumulative
total returns of 14.69% based on market price and 14.20% based on net asset
value. In comparison, the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Government Bond Index (GBI) Global
posted cumulative total returns of 4.28% in local currency terms and 11.41% in
U.S. dollar terms for the same period.1 You can find the Fund's longterm
performance data in the Performance Summary on page 10.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Over the past fiscal year, the global economic recovery solidified,
characterized by improved growth in the U.S. and Asia and export-led growth in
much of Europe. Despite a large rise in oil and other commodity prices,
underlying global inflation remained subdued during most of the period, although
an upturn was observed in some regions later in the reporting period. As a
result, global bond markets generated positive returns in local currency terms
while currency gains against the U.S. dollar further extended bond market
returns for the period.

Amid this more positive global growth environment, some inflationary pressures
finally began to emerge in the U.S., in part as high global commodity prices
passed through to domestic prices. Core consumer prices (excluding food and
energy) rose from historically low levels of 1.3% at the beginning of the fiscal
year to a more typical level of 1.7% by period-end. Additionally, the labor
market began to recover, although the pace of hiring was more tentative than in
prior economic cycles. Even with some slowing in economic activity during the
second quarter of 2004, productivity rates remained favorable. The Federal
Reserve Board (Fed) began to remove some economic stimulus, raising the federal
funds target rate half a percentage point (0.50%) to 1.50% by period-end as some
of the deflationary risks present in the economy since the last rate reduction
appeared to diminish.

Consistent with a pick-up in economic growth with U.S. trade partners and a
relatively weaker U.S. dollar, export growth rebounded. However, import growth
surged as well, driving the U.S. trade deficit to another record monthly deficit
level of over $50 billion in July. 2 The trade deficit helped drive the current
account deficit to a record level totaling over $500 billion, adding further
negative pressure on the U.S. balance of payments position. 3 The magnitude of
the current

WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS A CURRENT ACCOUNT?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A current account is that part of the balance of payments where all of one
country's international transactions in goods and services are recorded.

account deficit also remained quite large relative to the country's economy at
nearly 5.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). 4 To help finance this deficit
within the balance of payments, the U.S. continued to rely on foreigners'
purchases of U.S. bonds. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate over the past
year, declining 8.34% against the U.S.'s major trading partners. 5

Economic growth in the 12-country euro zone strengthened throughout the course
of the Fund's fiscal year, reaching 2.0% during the second quarter compared with
one year earlier. 6 Growth was driven by the export sector rather than domestic
demand, limiting underlying inflation pressures. The relatively stronger euro
compared with prior periods has helped allow the European Central Bank (ECB) to
keep rates historically low, in both nominal and real terms. The rebounding
global economy also maintained healthy export growth, despite the relatively
stronger euro. In contrast to the U.S., the euro zone current account remained
in surplus at 0.7% of GDP. 7 Growth among surrounding European economies,
including Scandinavia and central Europe, remained higher and more broad-based,
reaching rates of 4.1% in Norway, 3.4% in Sweden, 4.0% in Hungary and 6.1% in
Poland in second quarter 2004 compared with a year earlier. 8 Additionally,
Sweden and Norway maintained impressive current account surpluses at nearly 7.3%
and 13.0% of GDP. 9

Asia's economic growth remained robust, despite some indication of an engineered
slowdown in China marginally impacting growth of regional trade partners. During
the second quarter of 2004, economic growth was 9.6% in China, 6.3% in Thailand,
5.5% in South Korea and 4.3% in Indonesia compared with the same quarter in
2003. 10 Japan was the exception, with growth rates falling from 6.4% in the
first quarter compared with a year earlier to 1.3% in the second quarter
compared with a year earlier as a domestic demand recovery remained uncertain.11
While growth was more broad-based in some Asian countries than others, one
common characteristic was external sector strength. In South Korea for example,
export growth continued to accelerate, exceeding 29% by period-end. 12
Similarly, Thai exports rose nearly 25% and Japan's over 14%.13 These positive
conditions contributed to the region's rising international reserves, and
despite showing signs of slowing, remained impressive. In Japan, foreign
currency reserves increased

$273 billion for the 12-month period, partially as a result of massive direct
currency intervention during the first quarter of the year. Japan purchased
foreign currency worth approximately $140 billion, slowing currency appreciation
relative to the U.S. dollar. Overall, Japan's foreign currency reserves stood at
$808 billion on August 31, 2004, up 51% from a year earlier. 14 Other Asian
countries continued to experience similar reserve accumulation, although on a
smaller scale. South Korea's reserves rose 25%, Thailand's 14% and Indonesia's
4% for the year under review. 15 With the exceptions of Japan, South Korea and
Indonesia, there was some evidence of mounting inflationary pressure throughout
the region, given strong aggregate growth and little changes in monetary or
exchange rate policy.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency rates
and credit risk.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return is influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

During the reporting period, interest rate policy generally became less
accommodative. As economic growth rebounded and an interest rate tightening
cycle, particularly in the U.S., became more probable, we reduced the Fund's
overall portfolio duration exposure. Although the Fed raised U.S. interest
rates, shortterm real interest rates (accounting for inflation) remained
negative and the monetary stance still accommodative. Therefore, the Fund
remained positioned defensively to a further rise in U.S. interest rates by
maintaining a zero allocation to U.S. Treasury securities.

Monetary policy is largely a function of individual country economic and policy
conditions. Thus, globally, we found opportunities during the period where
interest rate reductions produced positive local market bond returns, or returns
in local currency terms, and other instances where interest rate increases
facilitated currency gains and overall bond market returns in U.S. dollar terms.
During the period, U.S. yields were at historically low levels. Globally, as
shown in the chart to the right, several other international government treasury
markets offered

substantially higher yields at period-end, which was fairly typical during the

zone bond markets returned 5.55% in local currency terms. 1 Elsewhere in Europe,
Norway and Sweden reduced interest rates 125 and 75 basis points (100 basis
points equal 1.00%) to 1.75% and 2.00% during the reporting period. 16
Meanwhile, Hungary and Poland raised interest rates 150 and 125 basis points to
11.00% and 6.50%. 17 Correspondingly, Norwegian, Swedish, Hungarian and Polish
local bond markets generated returns of 8.51%, 6.44%, 2.45% and -0.62%,
respectively, for the 12 months under review, as measured by the Citigroup World
Government Bond Index (Norway), the JPM GBI Global (Sweden) and the JPM GBI
Broad (Hungary and Poland). 18

Among Asia Pacific economies, Australia and New Zealand raised interest rates
largely due to stronger domestic growth. Australia raised interest rates 50
basis points to 5.25% and New Zealand 100 basis points to 5.75%, and their bond
markets produced positive returns of 5.25% and 4.35% over the 12-month

period. 19 Strong economic expansion driven by export growth and domestic demand
prompted the Thai central bank to raise rates 25 basis points to 1.50%.20 Local
Thai bond markets reacted more negatively, declining 3.29% over the year. 21 To
help manage this risk, the Fund was positioned in short duration securities in
Thailand.

South Korea and Indonesia, on the other hand, experienced declining interest
rates. South Korea reduced rates 25 basis points to 3.50% following a slowdown
in the real economy, particularly with regard to weak consumption and private
investment. 22 Additionally, Indonesia reduced rates 150 basis points to 7.00%
following a decline in inflation and improved macroeconomic stability. 23 Local
bond markets in South Korea and Indonesia rose 7.94% and 10.34%. 21

CURRENCY STRATEGY

Although the U.S. sub-index of the JPM GBI Global outperformed other local
markets, rising 5.65%, currency gains against the U.S. dollar during the period
helped global bond markets outperform the U.S. market with the JPM GBI Global
increasing 11.41% in U.S. dollar terms. 1 Consequently, the Fund benefited from
its underweighted position in the U.S. relative to the JPM GBI Global.

In Europe, the euro rose 10.70% against the U.S. dollar and European Monetary
Unit (EMU) bond markets returned 16.83% in U.S. dollar terms, as measured by the
JPM EMU Government Bond Index.24 Although the euro remained one of our largest
currency exposures, we reduced this allocation given that much of the U.S.
dollar's adjustment had been against the euro, and because we saw better value
in Asian and other European (non-euro) currencies.

Among the Fund's other European currency positions, we benefited from exposure
to the Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone and the Hungarian forint. During the
period, these currencies rose 11.29%, 8.51% and 14.58%, respectively, and
combined with gains in the local markets, brought bond returns to 18.46%, 17.74%
and 17.38%, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms.25 Despite a narrowing interest
rate differential in Norway and Sweden over the period, accelerating growth,

current account surpluses and fiscal positions remained supportive of currency
levels, particularly relative to the euro.

Growth rates and export performance were particularly striking in the central
European economies, including Hungary and Poland, which joined the European
Union (EU) in May 2004. In addition to the Hungarian forint's strong return, the
Polish zloty rose 8.64%. Higher growth rates, prospects for rising interest
rates and attractive yields relative to the euro zone provided support to these
currencies. The Fund added a new position in Poland later in the reporting
period as Poland's government bonds and currency lagged other European markets.
The zloty began to benefit only later in the period from progress on fiscal
reform, entry into the EU and solid macroeconomic performance.

In Asia, the Fund benefited from its lack of exposure to Japan. Although the yen
rose 6.32% against the U.S. dollar, Japanese government bonds underperformed the
broader market, returning only 7.53% in U.S. dollar terms. 1 The Australian and
New Zealand dollars rose 9.10% and 13.70% against the U.S. dollar during the
12-month period. With some of the highest currency returns in the Asia Pacific
region, Australian and New Zealand government bond markets rose 14.83% and
18.64% in U.S. dollar terms, benefiting relative Fund performance. 26 In
addition to positive growth trends, favorable interest rates relative to other
developed markets, positive immigration trends, continued fiscal surpluses and
trade linkages to Asia supported currency performance. The Fund also benefited
from its overweighted position in South Korea relative to the JPM GBI Broad,
whose bond market rose 10.36% in U.S. dollar terms following a 2.29%
appreciation of the South Korean won versus the U.S. dollar. 21

The Fund continued to increase its allocation to non-Japan Asia during the
period given strong regional growth and trade patterns, and to position itself
for potential currency appreciation. Exposure to other Asian currencies weighed
on Fund performance as the Thai baht depreciated 1.34% and the Indonesian
sub-index of the HSBC Asian Local Bond Index (ALBI) fell 0.08% in U.S. dollar
terms. 21 Uncertainty surrounding Indonesia's presidential election contributed
to currency volatility, with the Indonesian rupiah declining 9.49% against the
U.S. dollar. We sought to position the Fund for the currency's longer-term
potential due to what we considered solid macroeconomic and credit conditions
following the election's conclusion, scheduled for September 2004.

<PAGE>
GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also purchased investment-grade and sub-investment grade sovereign debt
that typically compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher yields
relative to U.S. and European benchmark treasury curves. U.S. dollar denominated
emerging market debt returned 13.57% over the period, as measured by the JPM
Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG). 27 Sovereign interest rate spreads
declined from 482 basis points greater than the U.S. Treasury market at the
beginning of the reporting period to 425 basis points by period-end. 26 Euro
denominated markets also rose strongly, gaining 11.41% in euro terms and 23.89%
in U.S. dollar terms, as measured by the JPM Euro EMBIG. 28

Regionally, Latin American sovereign debt rose 15.84%, eastern Europe 11.48% and
Asia 8.47%. 27 The global demand recovery significantly benefited emerging
market economies, particularly commodity exporters, supporting growth and in
some cases balance of payment and fiscal conditions. As a result, underlying
macroeconomic and credit fundamentals remained stronger than in previous
economic tightening cycles. For example, in Russia, high oil prices provided an
opportunity for the government to establish a stabilization fund. Similarly in
Ukraine, economic growth benefited from rising global demand for commodities,
driving Ukraine's export performance and economic growth rates of more than
13.0% for the first seven months of 2004. 29

Although U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt produced solid returns over the
12-month period, the Fund shortened duration and reallocated away from U.S.
dollar-denominated investment-grade and sub-investment grade debt given a
greater

sensitivity to rising U.S. rates. Consequently, the Fund added to local currency
markets given prospects for yield and currency appreciation. As of August 31,
2004, 16.83% of the Fund's total net assets were invested in sub-investment
grade sovereign debt based on independent credit rating agency Standard & Poor's
ratings.

Important Notice to Shareholders

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Fund's Board previously authorized management to implement an openmarket
share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase Fund shares,
from time to time, in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management.
This authorization remains in effect.

CHANGE TO NON-FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT POLICY

In December 2003, the Fund's Board approved the elimination of the Fund's
nonfundamental investment policy limiting the Fund's investment in Russian
securities to no more than 5% of the Fund's total assets. The Board's action
allows the Fund's investment manager to take advantage of additional attractive
investment opportunities in Russia, in excess of 5% of the Fund's total assets,
when the investment manager believes it is advisable to do so. The Fund's
primary goal of seeking high current income and its secondary goal of capital
appreciation remain the same.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (the Fund, formerly Templeton Global Income Fund,
Inc.) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end,
non-diversified investment company. Effective June 1, 2004, the Fund was
reorganized from a Maryland corporation into a Delaware statutory trust. The
Fund seeks high current income, with a secondary objective of capital
appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of
its net assets in a portfolio of debt securities of U.S. and foreign issuers
including emerging markets. The following summarizes the Fund's significant
accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange are valued at the
last reported sales price. Securities listed or traded on NASDAQ are valued at
their official closing price. Debt securities, other over-the-counter securities
and listed securities for which no sale is reported are valued within the range
of the latest quoted bid and asked prices by independent pricing services or
recognized dealers in such securities. Foreign securities are valued at the
close of trading of the foreign exchange or the NYSE, whichever is earlier. If
events occur that materially affect the values of securities after the prices or
foreign exchange rates are determined, but prior to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or
the close of trading on the NYSE, whichever is earlier, or if market quotations
are deemed not readily available or reliable, the securities will be valued at
fair value. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net
asset value. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included
in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income. Fund distributions to
shareholders are determined on a tax basis and may differ from net investment
income and realized gains for financial reporting purposes.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Certain income from foreign securities is recorded as soon as information is
available. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Discounts
and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the
respective securities. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The Board of the Fund previously authorized an open-market share repurchase
program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time, Fund shares
in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This authorization
remains in effect. Through August 31, 2004, the Fund had repurchased a total of
11,210,400 shares.

At August 31, 2004, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized (without
par value). During the year ended August 31, 2004, 199,459 shares were issued
for $1,767,365 from reinvested distributions. During the year ended August 31,
2003, 6,265 shares were issued for $43,136 from reinvested distributions.

7. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 16.83% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

8. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS

MASSACHUSETTS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
On September 20, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Resources, Inc. and
its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the "Company") announced that
an agreement has been reached by two of its subsidiaries, Franklin Advisers,
Inc. ("Franklin Advisers") and Franklin Templeton Alternative Strategies, Inc.
("FTAS"), with the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "State of Massachusetts") related to an
administrative complaint filed on February 4, 2004. The administrative complaint
addressed one instance of market timing that was also a subject of the August 2,
2004 settlement that Franklin Advisers reached with the SEC, as described below.

Under the terms of the settlement consent order issued by the State of
Massachusetts, Franklin Advisers and FTAS have consented to the entry of a
cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million administrative fine to the
State of Massachusetts. The consent order has multiple sections, including
"Statements of Fact" and "Violations of Massachusetts Securities Laws." The
Company admitted the "Statements of Fact." The Company did not admit or deny the
"Violations of the Massachusetts Securities Laws." While Franklin Advisers and
FTAS did not admit or deny engaging in any wrongdoing, the Company believes that
it is in its best interest and the interests of its funds' shareholders to
settle this issue now and move forward.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) SETTLEMENT
On August 2, 2004, the Company announced that an agreement has been reached by
Franklin Advisers with the SEC that resolves the issues resulting from the SEC's
investigation of market timing activity and the SEC issued an "Order instituting
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to sections 203(e) and
203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, making findings and imposing remedial sanctions
and a cease-and-desist order" (the "Order"). The SEC's Order concerns the
activities of a limited number of third parties that ended in 2000 and those
that are the subject of the Massachusetts administrative complaint described
above.

Under the terms of the SEC's Order, pursuant to which Franklin Advisers neither
admits nor denies any wrongdoing, Franklin Advisers has agreed to pay $50
million, of which $20 million is a civil penalty, to be distributed to
shareholders of certain funds in accordance with a plan to be developed by an
Independent Distribution Consultant. At this time, it is unclear which funds
will receive distributions or which shareholders of any particular fund will
receive distributions. The SEC Order also requires Franklin Advisers to, among
other things, enhance and periodically review compliance policies and
procedures.

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
As part of ongoing investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney
General, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the Florida
Department of Financial Services and the Commissioner of Securities, the West
Virginia Attorney General, the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance,
Securities, and Health Care Administration and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and payments to securities dealers who
sell fund shares, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current
or former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for
information and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and
its current employees have been providing documents and information in response
to these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to
requests for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of
the foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management
business.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS (CONTINUED)
The staff of the SEC has also informed the Company that it is considering
recommending a civil action or proceeding against Franklin Advisers and Franklin
Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI") concerning payments to securities dealers
who sell fund shares (commonly referred to as "revenue sharing"). The staff of
the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO") also has advised the Company
that the California Attorney General is authorized to bring a civil action
against the Company and FTDI arising from the same events. Even though the
Company currently believes that the charges the SEC staff and CAGO staff are
contemplating are unwarranted, it also believes that it is in the best interest
of the Company's and funds' shareholders to resolve these issues voluntarily, to
the extent the Company can reasonably do so. The Company continues to have
discussions towards resolving these governmental investigations.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company, in addition to other entities within Franklin Templeton
Investments, including certain of its subsidiaries, other funds, and current and
former officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits
in different federal courts in Nevada, California, Illinois, New York and
Florida, alleging violations of various federal securities laws and seeking,
among other things, monetary damages and costs. Specifically, the lawsuits claim
breach of duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit market timing
and/or late trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to the valuation of
the portfolio securities of certain funds managed by Company subsidiaries,
resulting in alleged market timing activity. The majority of these lawsuits
duplicate, in whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the Massachusetts
administrative complaint described above. The lawsuits are styled as class
actions or derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or the
Company.

Various subsidiaries of the Company have also been named in multiple lawsuits
filed in state courts in Illinois alleging breach of duty with respect to
valuation of the portfolio securities of certain funds managed by such
subsidiaries.

In addition, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as well as certain
current and former officers, employees, and directors have been named in
multiple lawsuits alleging violations of various securities laws and pendent
state law claims relating to the disclosure of directed brokerage payments
and/or payment of allegedly excessive advisory, commission, and distribution
fees. These lawsuits are styled as class actions and derivative actions brought
on behalf of certain funds.

The Company's management strongly believes that the claims made in each of these
lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing
governmental investigations or class actions or other lawsuits. If the Company
finds that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct
that caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its
shareholders whole, as appropriate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Templeton Global Income Fund
(the "Fund," formerly Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc.) at August 31, 2004,
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at August 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

At August 31, 2004, more than 50% of the Templeton Global Income Fund's total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from income paid to the Fund on these investments.
As shown in the table below, the Fund hereby designates to shareholders the
foreign source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the
Internal Revenue Code. This designation will allow shareholders of record on
August 17, 2004, to treat their proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the
Fund as having been paid directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these
amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund
distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, foreign qualified dividends, and adjusted foreign
source income as designated by the Fund to shareholders of record. As a service
to individual shareholders filing Form 1116, "Adjusted Foreign Source Income per
Share" in column 4 below reports foreign source income with the required
adjustments to foreign source qualified dividends. This information is provided
to simplify your reporting of foreign source income for line 1 of Form 1116.

Templeton Global Income Fund

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)


Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit or deduction (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a
minimum of 16 days during the 30-day period beginning 15 days before the
ex-dividend date of the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate).

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends without adjustment for the lower U.S.
tax rates. Generally, this is the foreign source income to be reported by
certain trusts and corporate shareholders.

Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. If you are an individual shareholder who
does not meet the qualified dividend holding period requirements, you may find
this information helpful to calculate the foreign source income adjustment
needed to complete line 1 of Form 1116.

Adjusted Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 4) is the adjusted amount per
share of foreign source income the Fund paid to you. These amounts reflect the
Foreign Source Income reported in column 2 adjusted for the tax rate
differential on foreign source qualified dividends that may be required for
certain individual shareholders pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 904(b)(2)(B).
If you are an individual shareholder who meets the qualified dividend holding
period requirements, generally, these Adjusted Foreign Source Income amounts may
be reported directly on line 1 of Form 1116 without additional adjustment.

In January 2005, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2004. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has been
reduced to take into account the tax rate differential on foreign source
qualified dividend income pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 904(b)(2)(B).
Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for information on the
treatment of these amounts on their 2004 individual income tax returns.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to Mellon
Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a
maximum of $5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her
account. These payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon
Bank, N.A." and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh,
PA 15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator
shall apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share
of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fees for a sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O.
Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds, less a
service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per share, to the
participant.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the Proxy
Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with
the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved in
the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS. In light of several high profile accounting scandals,
the manager will closely scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a
case-by-case basis, the manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit
relationships and non-audit fees. The manager will also consider, on a
case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and will vote against the
ratification of auditors when there is clear and compelling evidence of
accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies on-line at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by
calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954/847-2268 or by sending a written
request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East Broward Boulevard, Suite
1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy Group. Copies of the Fund's
proxy voting records are available on-line at franklintempleton.com and posted
on the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV and reflect the twelve-month period beginning
July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2004.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS OF A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend
nominees to the Registrant's Board of Trustees that would require disclosure
herein.


ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(b) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

<DESCRIPTION>CODE OF ETHICS -PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FIN. OFFICERS
<TEXT>
                                                                EXHIBIT (A)


                           FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code")/1 is for the investment companies within
the complex  registered with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers,  Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the
"Covered  Officers"  each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
       apparent  conflicts  of interest  between  personal  and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant  files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons  identified in the Code;  and o  Accountability  for
       adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the FT Funds. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the FT Funds.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
       influence  investment decisions or financial reporting by the FT Funds
       whereby the Covered Officer would benefit  personally to the detriment
       of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report at least  annually the  following  affiliations  or  other
       relationships:/2

     o all  directorships for public companies and all companies that  are
       required to file reports with the SEC;

     o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
       directors;

     o any direct or indirect business  relationship with any independent public
       accounting firm; and

     o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund that
       will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from the
       advisory, sub-advisory,  distribution  or service agreements  with
       affiliates of Franklin Resources).

      There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related,  reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any  question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
       charges  or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
       equity ownership.

  FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
       to misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside  the  FT  Funds,  including  to the FT  Funds'  directors  and
       auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators  and   self-regulatory
       organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
       responsibility,  consult with other  officers and  employees of the FT
       Funds,  the adviser and the  administrator  with the goal of promoting
       full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure in the
       reports and  documents  the FT Funds file with,  or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules
       and regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
       Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
       read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he
       knows of any  violation of this Code.  Failure to do so is itself is a
       violation of this Code.

      FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation./4/
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers/5/ sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

      The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
       action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;

     o If, after such  investigation, FT's General  Counsel or Deputy  General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred,  FT's General Counsel
       is not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes
       is a violation  will be reported to the  Independent  Directors of the
       appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the  Independent  Directors  concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation  to the Board of the appropriate
       Funds,  which will  consider  appropriate  action,  which may  include
       review of, and appropriate  modifications to, applicable  policies and
       procedures;  notification  to appropriate  personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board;  or a  recommendation  to  dismiss  the  Covered
       Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the FT Funds for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable  to registered  investment  companies  there under.  Insofar as other
policies  or  procedures  of the FT  Funds,  the FT Funds'  advisers,  principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions of this Code.  The FT Code of Ethics and Policy  Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter  pursuant  to Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company Act and more
detailed  policies  and  procedures  set  forth in FT's  Employee  Handbook  are
separate  requirements  applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.



- -------------------------------------

1 Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual report; (2) post the text of the code on its Internet website and
disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3) undertake in
its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person without charge,
upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the registrant's annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting such information on
its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet address and this
intention.

2 Reporting of these affiliations or other  relationships may be made separately
by completing  the Directors  and Officers  Questionnaire  and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel.

3 Any  activity  or  relationship  that would  present a conflict  for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
of the Covered  Officer's  immediate  family  engages in such an activity or has
such a  relationship.  The Cover Person should also obtain  written  approval by
FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4 FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult,  as
appropriate,  with members of the Audit  Committee,  counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent  Directors,  and are encouraged to do so.

5 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines  "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material  departure  from a  provision  of the  code of  ethics"  and  "implicit
waiver,"  which must also be  disclosed,  as "the  registrant's  failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material  departure from a
provision  of the  code of  ethics  that  has been  made  known to an  executive
officer" of the registrant.
