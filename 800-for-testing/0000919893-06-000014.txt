                              GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management groups--
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                              Templeton offers investors a truly global
                              perspective.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                              it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                              arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to different investment approaches,
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                              typically have distinct portfolios. That's why our
                              funds can be used to build truly diversified
                              allocation plans covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                              that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                              names in financial services.

REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program, which was

discontinued the open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection
with the Fund's previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund
may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the six months under review, regional economic growth remained robust.
Despite efforts aimed at cooling China's overheated sectors, the economy grew
11.3% in second quarter 2006, higher than the 10.3% growth recorded in the first
quarter. 1 As evidence of China's increasing role in the global market, the
government projects its 2006 trade surplus to be between US$120 billion and
US$130 billion, surpassing last year's US$102 billion. 2

In Hong Kong, gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from 7.5% in
fourth quarter 2005 from a year earlier to 8.2% in first quarter 2006 from a
year earlier. 3 Key drivers included rising exports and consumer expenditures.
Unemployment continued to decline, ending June 2006 at 5.0%. 3 The government
budget registered its first surplus in eight years in the fiscal year ended
March 2006 due to higher tax revenues and cost cutting measures.

Taiwan's economy grew 4.9% in first quarter 2006 from a year earlier. 4 This was
lower than the 6.4% growth rate recorded in fourth quarter 2005 mainly due to
high oil prices and rising credit card debt, which subsequently impacted
consumer expenditures. 4 Relations between Taiwan and mainland China somewhat
improved during the period as both sides agreed to develop trade links and
increase mainland tourist flow to Taiwan.

For investors, 2006 began where 2005 left off -- on a wave of optimism. The
markets had ample liquidity as fund flows remained strong. However, many global
financial markets declined in early May as markets experienced substantial fund
outflows triggered by U.S. inflationary pressures and increased uncertainty over
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy.

In this environment, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) China Index
posted a +23.70% return in U.S. dollar terms as Chinese stocks held on to most
of the strong gains recorded earlier in the period. 5 Political instability in
Taiwan stemming from allegations of corruption against President Chen
Shui-bian's government and family members led investors to be more cautious,
while rising interest rates in the first part of the period adversely impacted

Hong Kong's stock market. However, improving market sentiment allowed both
markets to end the reporting period with positive returns.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

During the six-month reporting period, the Fund's underweighted exposures to the
telecommunication services and transportation sectors were among the largest
contributors to performance relative to the MSCI China Index. 6 In
telecommunications services, our underweighted positions in China Telecom and
China Mobile benefited the Fund. No holdings in transportation companies such as
China Shipping Containers, Zhejiang Expressway and China Shipping Development
contributed to relative performance as these stocks underperformed the index.

Stock selection in food products further supported Fund performance. Within this
industry, the Fund gained from its holding in Uni-President Enterprises, which
is not part of the index, as the stock significantly outperformed the index
during the period.

6.    The telecommunication services sector comprises diversified
      telecommunication services and wireless telecommunication services in the
      SOI. The transportation sector comprises air freight and logistics,
      airlines, and transportation infrastructure.

It is important to recognize the effect of currency movements on the Fund's
performance. In general, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases compared with
a foreign currency, an investment traded in that foreign currency will decrease
in value because it will be worth fewer U.S. dollars. This can have a negative
effect on Fund performance. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation
to a foreign currency, an investment traded in that foreign currency will
increase in value, which can contribute to Fund performance. For the six months
ended June 30, 2006, the U.S. dollar fell in value relative to most non-U.S.
currencies. As a result, the Fund's performance was positively affected by the
portfolio's predominant investment in securities with non-U.S. currency
exposure. However, one cannot expect the same results in future periods.

Conversely, the Fund's overweighted exposures to the food and staples retailing
industry and technology hardware and equipment sector negatively impacted
performance relative to the index. 7 The Fund only held one food and staples
retailing stock, Dairy Farm International Holdings, which declined during the
period. Dairy Farm operates supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores and
restaurants in Asia and stands to benefit from the region's growing consumer
demand. In technology hardware and equipment, the Fund's holdings in Acer and
Asustek Computer, which are not part of the index, hampered Fund performance.

An underweighted position in the outperforming insurance industry also adversely
affected relative performance. The Fund's underweighted allocation to China Life
Insurance and lack of exposure to PICC Property & Casualty detracted from
relative performance as these stocks recorded double-digit returns during the
period. Seeking to take advantage of recent market volatility, which brought the
stock to what we considered were more reasonable valuations, we increased the
Fund's China Life Insurance holding.

During the period, the Fund also continued to invest in stocks we believed could
benefit from global economic developments as well as in individual emerging
markets. A dominant theme was sustained high commodity prices despite an oil
price correction in May. Thus, the Fund significantly increased its exposure to
energy stocks as we think these companies should benefit from higher revenues
and greater earnings. 8 Key purchases included adding to PetroChina, a dominant
player in the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry, and
initiating a position in CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil and natural gas
exploration and production company.

7.    The technology hardware and equipment sector comprises communications
      equipment, computers and peripherals, electronic equipment and
      instruments, office electronics, and semiconductors and semiconductor
      equipment in the SOI.

8.    The energy sector comprises electric utilities; independent power
      producers and energy traders; and oil, gas and consumable fuels in the
      SOI.

<PAGE>

We also made substantial investments in the commercial banks and diversified
telecommunication services industries. The financial sector's liberalization
could unlock hidden value and allow banks to benefit from consumers' growing
financial needs. Higher incomes and strong consumer demand should lead to
greater use of telecommunication services, which could benefit the region's
major service providers. We initiated a position in Bank of China, which had its
initial price offering during the period and is one of the country's four
largest commercial banks, and purchased additional shares of Chinatrust
Financial Holding, a leading consumer bank in Taiwan, and China Telecom, a
dominant telecommunication services provider in Southern China.

During the period, the Fund realized gains on selected Taiwan and Hong Kong
stocks, thereby reducing exposure to those markets. Significant sales included
shares of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, the owner and operator of eight hotels
including Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel; Hang Lung Group, a Hong Kong property
developer; Acer, a major global PC market player; and Delta Electronics, a
Taiwanese electronic equipment manufacturer.

Thank you for your continued participation in Templeton Dragon Fund. We look
forward to serving your future investment needs.

Performance Summary (CONTINUED)

ENDNOTES

SPECIAL RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN INVESTING, INCLUDING CURRENCY
VOLATILITY, ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTRIES WHERE
THE FUND INVESTS. EMERGING MARKETS INVOLVE HEIGHTENED RISKS RELATED TO THE SAME
FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND
LESSER LIQUIDITY. ALSO, AS A NONDIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT COMPANY INVESTING IN
"CHINA COMPANIES," THE FUND MAY INVEST IN A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF ISSUERS
AND, AS A RESULT, BE SUBJECT TO A GREATER RISK OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO ITS
PORTFOLIO SECURITIES.

1.    Total return calculations represent the cumulative and average annual
      changes in value of an investment over the periods indicated. Six-month
      return has not been annualized.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end investment
company.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively.

Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for which there is no reported
sale are valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices.
Securities that trade in multiple markets or on multiple exchanges are valued
according to the broadest and most representative market. Investments in
open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. The investment manager monitors price movements
following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of
country specific market proxies (such as baskets of American Depository
Receipts, futures contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements
are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market
proxy to

assist in determining if an event has occurred. If such an event occurs, the
securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may include the use
of independent pricing services. All security valuation procedures are approved
by the Fund's Board of Directors.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund intends to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from foreign
securities are recognized as soon as the Fund is notified of the ex-dividend
date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are
determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These differences may be permanent or temporary.
Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their
tax character. These reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the
results of operations. Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may
reverse in subsequent periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program. Originally
implemented in October 1997, the Fund's Board of Directors had discontinued the
open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection with the Fund's
previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund may purchase,
from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market
transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

At June 30, 2006, there were 100 million shares authorized ($0.01 par value).
During the period ended June 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005,
there were no share transactions; all reinvested distributions were satisfied
with previously issued shares purchased in the open market.

4. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the period ended June 30, 2006, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

5. INCOME TAXES

For tax purposes, realized currency losses occurring subsequent to October 31
may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. At December 31, 2005, the Fund deferred realized currency losses of
$2,565.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales and foreign currency
transactions.

At June 30, 2006, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments ................................   $517,751,504
                                                       ============

Unrealized appreciation ............................   $349,966,745

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
period ended June 30, 2006, aggregated $78,443,258 and $128,364,930,
respectively.

Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Franklin Advisers, Inc. (an affiliate of the investment manager). Management
fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep Money Fund, in
an amount not to exceed the management and administrative fees paid by the Sweep
Money Fund.

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. PREVIOUS LITIGATION

Pursuant to a settlement agreement which was announced on March 20, 2003,
between the Fund and Harvard College, a former shareholder of the Fund, Harvard
Management Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor
to Harvard College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management at the
time (referred to collectively as "Harvard"), the Fund agreed to take, and the
Board approved, the following actions, among other actions, which have already
been carried out.

      o     IN-KIND TENDER OFFERS--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an
            exemptive order allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic
            tender offers, each for up to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares
            at a price equal to 95% of net asset value per share as of the date
            the offer expires, to be paid entirely in kind through a pro rata
            distribution of marketable portfolio securities and available
            cash. Subject to certain conditions, the settlement required the
            Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for 20% of the Fund's
            shares within three months after obtaining the SEC exemption. The
            Fund has also been required under the settlement to conduct, on
            substantially identical terms, up to two additional in-kind tender
            offers under certain circumstances. There is no assurance that the
            SEC will issue the exemptive order, nor is it possible to predict
            the date when an exemptive order might be granted.

      o     ADDITIONAL CASH TENDER OFFERS--If the SEC did not issue the
            exemptive order for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the
            settlement provided that the Fund could, but was not obligated to,
            conduct an additional cash tender offer, and possibly later
            follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15% of the Fund's
            outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per share
            as of the date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if
            the Fund did not conduct these tender offers, Harvard would be
            relieved of its obligation to refrain from making shareholder
            proposals and taking other actions with respect to the Fund. The
            exemptive application was not received by March 26, 2004 and the
            Fund did not conduct any tender offers for the period ended June 30,
            2006.

The settlement agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.

9. PREVIOUS LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, Inc., nor to encourage
others to do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any
time to acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or
similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, relating to certain practices in the
mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators.

Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning market timing (the "August 2, 2004 SEC
Order") and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund
shares (the "December 13, 2004 SEC Order") and with the California Attorney
General's Office ("CAGO") concerning marketing support payments to securities
dealers who sell fund shares (the "CAGO Settlement"). Under the terms of the
settlements with the SEC and the CAGO, the Company retained an Independent
Distribution Consultant ("IDC") to develop separate plans for the distribution
of the respective settlement monies. The CAGO approved the distribution plan
pertaining to the distribution of the monies owed under the CAGO settlement
agreement, and in March 2005, the disbursement of monies to the relevant funds
in accordance with the terms and conditions of that settlement was completed.
The Fund did not participate in the CAGO Settlement.

On June 23, 2006, the SEC approved the IDC's proposed plan of distribution
arising from the December 13, 2004 SEC Order and disbursement of the settlement
monies to the designated funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the SEC's order and the plan will be completed in August, 2006. The Fund did not
participate in the December 13, 2004 SEC Order.

The IDC has also completed a proposed Plan of Distribution under the August 2,
2004 SEC Order resolving the SEC's market timing investigation and has submitted
that plan to the SEC staff, where it is under review. The SEC has announced the
following expected schedule with respect to the market timing Plan of
Distribution: "The SEC anticipates that Notice of the Plan will be published on
or after September 15, 2006. After publication and comment, the proposed
Distribution Plan will be submitted to the SEC for approval. When the SEC
approves the proposed Distribution Plan, with modifications as appropriate,
distributions will begin pursuant to that Plan. The SEC anticipates the
distribution will begin in the fall of 2006."

10. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, directors, and/or
employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as shareholder class
actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or
Franklin Resources, Inc.) relating to the industry practices referenced above,
as well as to allegedly excessive advisory fees, commissions, and/or 12b-1 fees.
The lawsuits were filed in different courts throughout the country. Many of
those suits are now pending in a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland.

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend
against them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual
outcome of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact
on the Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for
any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

11. FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN
48"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the
measurement, recognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along
with accounting for the related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and is to be applied to all open
tax years as of the date of effectiveness. We have not yet completed our
evaluation of the impact, if any, of adopting FIN 48 on the Fund's financial
statements.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc., who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attention:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares in the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held February 28, 2006, the Board of Directors ("Board"), including
a majority of non-interested or independent Directors, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. ("Fund"). In
reaching this decision, the Board took into account information furnished
throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information prepared
specifically in connection with the annual renewal review process. Information
furnished and discussed throughout the year included investment performance
reports on the Fund, information on its share price discount to net asset value,
and other related financial information, as well as periodic reports on legal,
compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and other services
provided by the Investment Manager ("Manager") and its affiliates. Information
furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process included a report
prepared by Lipper, Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent organization, as well as a
Fund profitability analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper report
compared the Fund's investment performance and expenses with those of other
funds deemed comparable to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund
profitability analysis report discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton
Investments from its overall U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual
fund-by-fund basis. Included with such profitability analysis report was
information on a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and other
accounts they manage, as well as information on management fees charged by the
Manager and its affiliates including management's explanation of differences
where relevant, and a three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any
increase in expense ratios. Additional information accompanying such report was
a memorandum prepared by management describing enhancements to the services
provided to the Fund by the Franklin Templeton Investments organization, as well
as a memorandum relating to economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Directors received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Directors, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's efforts and
expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures

to function in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted by the Board that
such systems and procedures had functioned smoothly during the hurricanes and
blackout experienced last year in Florida. Among other factors taken into
account by the Board were the Manager's best execution trading policies,
including a favorable report by an independent portfolio trading analytical
firm. Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's portfolio
management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of the level of a portfolio manager's bonus
compensation was the relative investment performance of the funds he or she
managed so as to be aligned with the interests of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement
renewals. The Lipper report prepared for the Fund showed its investment
performance during 2005 and the previous ten years ended December 31, 2005, in
comparison with a six-fund performance universe consisting of the Fund and all
other non-leveraged closed-end Pacific region funds as selected by Lipper. Such
report considers total return on a net asset value basis without regard to
market discounts or premiums to accurately reflect investment performance. The
Lipper report showed that while the Fund's total return for 2005 was the fourth
lowest of such group, its total return on an annualized basis was the highest in
such group during each of the previous three-, five- and ten-year periods. In
discussing this performance, management pointed out that the Fund's total return
in net asset value terms during 2005 exceeded that of the Morgan Stanley Capital
International China Index, which it believed was an appropriate basis of
comparison in view of the Fund's focus on China related stocks. The Board was
satisfied with the Fund's performance, noting that the Fund's 2005 total return
exceeded 20% as shown in such Lipper report.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a Lipper analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with those of a
group of four other funds selected by Lipper as its appropriate Lipper expense
group. Prior to making such comparison, the Board relied upon a survey showing
that the scope of services covered under the Fund's investment management
agreement was similar to those provided by fund managers to other fund groups
that would be used as a basis of comparison in the Lipper reports. In reviewing
comparative costs, emphasis was given to each Fund's management fee in
comparison with the effective management fee that would have been charged by
other funds within its Lipper expense group assuming they were the same size as
the Fund, as well as the actual total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison
with those of such expense group. The Lipper management effective fee analysis
considers administrative fees to be part of management fees and the results of
such expense comparisons showed the Fund's effective management fee rate to be
the highest in its expense group, and the Fund's actual total expense ratio to
be the second-highest in such

Lipper expense group. The Board found such expenses to be acceptable noting that
the Fund's total expense ratio of 1.547% was only slightly above the 1.543%
median of its Lipper expense group.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
each of the individual funds. The Board also considered the extent to which the
Manager and its affiliates might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations,
as well as potential benefits resulting from allocation of fund brokerage and
the use of "soft" commission dollars to pay for research. Specific attention was
given to the methodology followed in allocating costs to each fund, it being
recognized that allocation methodologies are inherently subjective and various
allocation methodologies may each be reasonable while producing different
results. In this respect, the Board noted that the cost allocation methodology
was consistent with that followed in profitability report presentations made in
prior years and that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm
had been engaged by the Manager to perform certain procedures on a biennial
basis, specified and approved by the Manager and the Fund's Board solely for
their purposes and use in reference to the profitability analysis. Included in
the analysis were the revenue and related costs involved in providing services
to the Fund, as well as the Fund's relative contribution to the profitability of
the Manager's parent. In reviewing and discussing such analysis, management
discussed with the Board its belief that costs incurred in establishing the
infrastructure necessary to the type of fund operations conducted by the Manager
and its affiliates may not be fully reflected in the expenses allocated to each
Fund in determining its profitability, as well as the fact that the level of
profits, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost savings and
efficiencies initiated by management. In addition, the Board considered a
third-party study comparing the profitability of the Manager's parent on an
overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers broken down to show
profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution expenses, as
well as profitability including distribution expenses. Based upon its
consideration of all these factors, the Board determined that the level of
profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates from providing services to
the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature, quality and extent of services
provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
Manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that should be
shared with the Fund and its shareholders and intends to monitor future growth
of the Fund accordingly. The Board noted at the end of 2005 the Fund's net
assets were approximately $823 million and that it had added a breakpoint to the
Fund's investment advisory fee at the $1 billion level.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Ltd. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved
in the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of directors, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

July 1, 2004 and ending June 30, 2005.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
