as applicable by the average of total monthly members' capital. Total return
amounts are calculated by geometrically linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

(a)  Annualized, except for organizational and offering expenses if applicable.

(b)  The Adviser  waived  $15,369 of management  fees for the period ended March
     31, 2003. The net investment loss prior to incentive allocation ratio would
     have been  (1.87%)  and the  expense  ratio  would  have  been  1.91% on an
     annualized  basis for that  period  had these  fees not been  waived by the
     Adviser.  Pursuant to an expense deferral agreement,  the Adviser requested
     reimbursement  of deferred  expenses  during the years ended March 31, 2004
     and 2005, and agreed to forego  reimbursement of deferred  expenses in each
     of those years also.  Reimbursement to the Adviser of deferred  expenses is
     included in the expense ratios for the periods in which such  reimbursement
     was requested.

(c)  Expenses of the underlying  Portfolio Funds are not included in the expense
     ratios.

(d)  Calculated  based on the amount  reallocable to the Special Members for the
     period April 1, 2007 to September 30, 2007 had the  measurement  period for
     incentive allocation closed on the date indicated.

     addition  to the  amount  that  would have been  allocable  to the  Special
     Members  for  the  period  January  1,  2006  to  March  31,  2006  had the

1.   ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end  management  investment company and
is  operating  as a  diversified  investment  company.  The Fund has many of the
features of a private  investment fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests")  are
offered  only in  private  placements  to persons  (i) who are both  "accredited
investors"  under the Securities  Act of 1933 and "qualified  clients" under the
Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940,  as amended and (ii) who meet other  investor
eligibility criteria established by the Fund. The primary investment  objectives
of the  Fund are to  provide  investors  (i) an  attractive,  long-term  rate of
return,  on an absolute as well as a risk-adjusted  basis,  (ii) low performance
volatility  and (iii)  minimal  correlation  with the  equity  and fixed  income
markets.  The Fund employs a multi-strategy,  multi-manager  investment strategy
premised  on the risk  control  benefits of  diversification  and the value of a
hedged  investment  approach.  The Fund seeks  diversification  by  investing in
partnerships and other investment  vehicles  ("Portfolio Funds") that (i) pursue
non-traditional  investment  strategies  and (ii) are  expected to exhibit a low
degree of performance  correlation,  not only with broad market indices but also
with each  other.  These  Portfolio  Funds are  managed by  selected  investment
managers  ("Investment  Managers") who specialize in the chosen strategies.  The
Fund generally invests in between 25 and 50 Portfolio Funds.

Banc of America Investment Advisors,  Inc. (the "Adviser") is the SEC registered
investment  adviser  to  the  Fund.  The  Adviser  is an  indirect  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of Bank of America  Corporation  ("BAC").  The Adviser has  retained
Grosvenor  Capital  Management,   L.P.  ("Grosvenor"  or  the  "Subadviser")  as
subadviser to the Fund. The Adviser and the Subadviser  have been  designated as
special members (the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's  investments are valued by the Adviser as of the close of business on
the last business day of each month in accordance  with policies and  procedures
approved by the Board. The Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may be subject
to limitations  on  redemptions,  including the  assessment of early  redemption
fees. In addition,  market quotations for such interests are not available. As a
result,  the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds are valued at fair value,
which  normally  will be the  value  determined  by the  portfolio  managers  or
administrators  of  Portfolio  Funds.  Such  value of the Fund's  interest  in a
Portfolio Fund generally  represents the Fund's  proportionate  share of the net
assets of the Portfolio  Fund. The value of the Fund's  investments in Portfolio
Funds is generally increased by additional  contributions to Portfolio Funds and
the  Fund's  share  of net  earnings  from  Portfolio  Funds  and  decreased  by
withdrawals and the Fund's share of net losses from Portfolio  Funds.  The Fund,
the Adviser,  and the  Subadviser  rely upon audited and  unaudited  reports and
estimates  prepared by or for the Portfolio Fund and any other  information that
they may receive from the Portfolio Fund,  which may be subject to adjustment by
the Portfolio Fund or its manager or  administrator.  The values assigned to the
Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds may not  represent  amounts that would
ultimately  be realized,  as such  amounts  depend on future  circumstances  and
cannot be  determined  until  the  liquidation  of the  Fund's  interest  in the
Portfolio Fund. The estimated  value of the Fund's  interests in Portfolio Funds
may differ significantly from the value received upon liquidation. The Fund, the
Adviser,  and the  Subadviser  will  not be able to  confirm  independently  the
accuracy  of the  valuations  provided  by  Portfolio  Funds or their  portfolio
managers or administrators.

Portfolio Funds, or their administrator or portfolio managers,  generally use an
independent  pricing source to value the funds'  securities.  Securities with no
readily  available  market value are initially  valued at cost,  with subsequent
adjustments to values, which reflect either meaningful third-party  transactions
in the private market, or fair value deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Fund or
its portfolio  manager or  administrator.  In such instances,  consideration may
also be given to the financial  condition  and operating  results of the issuer,
the amount that Portfolio  Funds can reasonably  expect to realize upon the sale
of the securities and other factors deemed relevant by the Portfolio Fund or its
portfolio manager or administrator.

<PAGE>
               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


Some of Portfolio  Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in illiquid
securities and may hold all or a portion of these  investments  separately  from
the rest of their portfolio.  These separate baskets of illiquid  securities may
be  subject  to  restrictions  on  liquidation  that  are more  strict  than the
liquidity restrictions applicable to general interests in the Portfolio Fund. If
the Fund  liquidates its interests in such a Portfolio  Fund, it may be required
to maintain these illiquid  securities for an extended period of time. The value
of these baskets of illiquid securities may fluctuate significantly.

C.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Purchases of investments in Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the first day of
legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and sales of Portfolio Funds are recorded as
of the last day of legal  ownership  or  participation.  Purchases  and sales of
other securities are accounted for on the trade-date  basis.  Realized gains and
losses are recorded at the time of disposition  of the respective  investment on
an average cost basis.

D.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

E.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state  taxes  have been  provided  on  profits  of the Fund  since the Fund's
members (the  "Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax
return their distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

F.   CASH

At September 30, 2007, a total of $6,084,603 in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust  Company,  the Fund's  custodian.  Of that amount,  $975,271 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

G.   FUTURES

The Fund utilized futures  contracts during the period ended September 30, 2007.
The Fund's use of futures is primarily for tactical  hedging  purposes.  Initial
margin  deposits of cash and  securities  are made upon  entering  into  futures
contracts. The contracts are marked to market and the resulting changes in value
are accounted for as unrealized gains and losses.  Variation margin payments are
paid or received, depending upon whether unrealized gains or


                                       12

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

losses are  incurred.  When the contract is closed,  the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference  between the proceeds from (or cost of) the
closing transaction and the amount invested in the contract.

Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there will
be an  imperfect  price  correlation  between  the  futures  and the  underlying
securities.  Second,  it is  possible  that  a lack  of  liquidity  for  futures
contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting  in an inability to
close a  position  prior to its  maturity  date.  Third,  the  futures  contract
involves  risk that the Fund could lose more than the  original  margin  deposit
required to initiate a futures transaction. Finally, the risk exists that losses
could exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of  investments or statement of
assets and liabilities.

H.   OPTIONS CONTRACTS

An option gives the owner the right,  but not the  obligation,  to buy or sell a
specified  item at a fixed price during a specified  period for a  nonrefundable
fee (the  "premium").  The  maximum  loss to the buyer is limited to the premium
originally  paid.  The  premiums  paid for the  purchase  of these  options  are
included in the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and  members'  capital as an
investment  and  subsequently  marked-to-market  to  reflect  the  value  of the
options,  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses  included  in  the  statement  of
operations.

As a writer  of  options,  the Fund  receives  a  premium  and bears the risk of
unfavorable  changes  in the  prices  of the  securities  or  index  instruments
underlying  the  options.  Premiums  received  from writing put and call options
which have not expired are presented in the liabilities section of the statement
of assets,  liabilities and members'  capital and  subsequently  adjusted to the
current  market  value of the options  written,  but not less than zero.  If the
current  market value of an option exceeds the premium  received,  the excess is
recorded as an  unrealized  loss and,  conversely,  if the  premium  exceeds the
current market value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded
as an unrealized gain.

3.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income, gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the


                                       13

management fee paid by the Fund) over such fiscal  period,  before giving effect
to any  distributions  and repurchases of Interests (or portions thereof) by the
Fund as of the end of such period and any capital  contributions made at the end
of such period  (such  capital  contributions  being deemed to be made as of the
next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2007.  The  interests  redeemed  pursuant  to  such  tenders  are  shown  in the
Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

4.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

For the six months ended  September 30, 2007,  aggregate  purchases and sales of
Portfolio Funds amounted to $62,617,129, and $12,806,352, respectively.

5.   MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management agreement between the Fund and the Adviser, the Adviser
is entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate
of 1.0% of the Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund before taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between  the  Adviser  and the  Subadviser,  the  Adviser  pays a portion of the
management fee that it receives from the Fund to the Subadviser.  The Subadviser
is also  reimbursed  by the  Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by the
Subadviser related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



6.   INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount (as defined below) for that Incentive  Period and (ii) the balance in the
Member's  Loss  Carryforward  (as  defined  below)  as of the  end of the  prior
Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if  its  Interest  as of  the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter  and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive  Period.  The Hurdle
Rate Amounts for June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2007 were 4.910% and 4.986% per
annum,  respectively.  On June 30, 2007 an incentive  allocation  of $50,259 was
realized upon redemption of a Member's interest.  Additional capital of $664,423
would have been reallocable to the Special Members had the Members'  measurement
period for incentive allocation closed on September 30, 2007.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution, and
the Member's  opening capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the
beginning of such Incentive Period,  will be allocated between the two Interests
in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that is  repurchased  or
distributed.

7.   ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC")  (also an affiliate  of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain  accounting,  record keeping,  investor related  services,  and
regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
and the administrator  based primarily upon month-end Members' capital,  subject
to a monthly minimum fee.

8.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each Board member who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by
the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer  of $6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for
each meeting attended. Any manager or officer who is an "interested person" does
not  receive  any  annual  fee or other  fees from the Fund.  All  managers  are
reimbursed by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

Investors  who  tendered  interests  in the Fund prior to the  December 31, 2005
tender  period were not paid interest on their  contingent  payment as stated on
the tender offer documents.  As a result, these investors were due interest from
the Fund in the aggregate  amount of $12,070  representing  the unpaid  interest
amount due to investors  from the date of the original  tender  payment  through
June 30,  2006.  The Adviser  reimbursed  the Fund for unpaid  interest  paid to
investors in the amount of $12,070, which activity is reflected in the statement
of changes in members' capital for the year ended March 31, 2007.


9.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
     RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal  course of  business,  Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund  invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only  invested  in  such  limited  partnership  and  limited  liability  company
interests.

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



9.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
     RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Members and will not be  exchangeable  for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have  limited
liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund  significant  repurchases.  Members
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be remote.

10.  LITIGATION EVENT

The  events  described  below  have not  directly  impacted  the Fund or had any
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in connection  with matters  relating to mutual fund
trading. Copies of the SEC Orders are available on the SEC

10.  LITIGATION EVENT (CONTINUED)

website at  http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of the NYAG Settlements are available as
part of the Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with the events that  resulted in the NYAG  Settlements  and SEC
Orders,  various  parties filed suit against certain  Columbia Funds  (including
former Nations Funds), the Trustees of the Columbia Funds (including Trustees of
the former Nations Funds),  FleetBoston Financial Corporation (the former parent
of the Adviser) and certain of its  affiliated  entities  and/or Bank of America
Corporation  and  certain  of its  affiliated  entities.  More  than 300  cases,
including  those filed against  entities  unaffiliated  with the Columbia Funds,
their Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  and its affiliated  entities
and/or Bank of America Corporation and its affiliated entities, were transferred
to a  multi-district  proceeding in the Federal  District  Court in Maryland for
consolidated  or  coordinated  pretrial  proceedings.  The parties  have reached
settlements  with respect to the claims in the actions  concerning  the Columbia
Funds. All such settlements are subject to court approval.

Certain  other  actions  against  certain  Columbia  Funds,  the Trustees of the
Columbia Funds,  advisers and affiliated  entities,  alleging among other things
excessive fees and  inappropriate  use of fund assets for distribution and other
improper purposes,  have been consolidated in the Massachusetts federal court as
IN RE COLUMBIA  ENTITIES  LITIGATION on March 2, 2005. On November 30, 2005, the
judge  dismissed all claims by plaintiffs and entered final judgment in favor of
the  defendants.  The plaintiffs  appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the First  Circuit on  December  30,  2005.  A  stipulation  and  settlement
agreement  dated January 19, 2007 was filed in the First Circuit on February 14,
2007,  with a joint  stipulation  of  dismissal  and motion for remand to obtain
district court approval of the settlement. That joint motion was granted and the
appeal was  dismissed.  On March 6, 2007,  the case was remanded to the District
Court. On May 11, 2007, the District Court entered a preliminary  approval order
which granted preliminary approval of the settlement.  The settlement,  approved
by the District Court on September 18, 2007,  became effective October 19, 2007.
The terms of the  settlement  require the Adviser  and/or its affiliates to make
certain payments  including  plaintiffs'  attorneys' fees and costs of notice to
class members.

11.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued FASB
interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes". This
standard  defines the  threshold  for  recognizing  the  benefits of  tax-return
positions in the financial statements as  "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained
by the taxing  authority and requires  measurement of a tax position meeting the
more-likely-than-not criterion,  based  on the largest benefit that is more than
50 percent likely to be realized. FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of the
first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. At adoption, companies must
adjust their  financial  statements to reflect only those tax positions that are
more-likely-than-not to  be  sustained as  of the  adoption  date.  Based on its
analysis,  management has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a
material impact to the Fund's financial statements upon adoption.

In September  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
STATEMENT  ON  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  (SFAS)  NO.  157,  "FAIR  VALUE
MEASUREMENTS." This standard  establishes a single  authoritative  definition of
fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  requires
additional  disclosures about fair value  measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value  measurements  already  required or permitted by existing  standards.
SFAS No. 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal  years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The  changes  to  current  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  from the
application  of this  Statement  relate to the  definition  of fair  value,  the
methods used to measure  fair value,  and the  expanded  disclosures  about fair
value  measurements.  As of September  30,  2007,  the Fund does not believe the
adoption  of SFAS No. 157 will  impact the  amounts  reported  in the  financial
statements,  however,  additional  disclosures will be required about the inputs
used to develop the  measurements  and the effect of certain of the measurements
reported on the Statement of Changes in Investors' Capital for a fiscal period.

12.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent  to  September  30,  2007,  the  Fund  received   additional  capital
contributions of $13,209,000.





The Fund files its complete  schedule of portfolio  holdings with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission (the  "Commission") for the first and third quarters of
each fiscal year on Form N-Q within sixty days after the end of the period.  The
Fund's Form N-Q is available on the Commission's website at  HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV,
and may be reviewed  and copied at the  Commission's  Public  Reference  Room in
Washington,  D.C.  Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may
be obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

BOARD ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting  held on  September  19,  2007,  the Board of Directors of Columbia
Management  Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund"),  which consists only of
Directors  who are not  "interested  persons"  of the  Fund (as  defined  in the
Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended),  approved the  continuation of the
Fund's  management  agreement (the "Management  Agreement") with Banc of America
Investment   Advisors,   Inc.  ("BAIA")  and  the  subadvisory   agreement  (the
"Subadvisory  Agreement"  and,  together  with  the  Management  Agreement,  the
"Advisory Agreements") with Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor") for
an additional  one-year period ending on October 31, 2008. At that meeting,  the
Board  considered  information and factors that it believed were relevant to the
interests of the Fund's investors,  and during its deliberations  consulted with
its independent legal counsel and with Fund counsel. In addition, at most of its
other meetings  throughout the year, the Board considers  matters bearing on the
Advisory Agreements.

The Directors received and reviewed all materials that they or their independent
legal  counsel  believed to be  reasonably  necessary  to evaluate  the Advisory
Agreements and determine whether to approve their continuation.  Those materials
included,  among other items, (i) a report prepared by BAIA comparing the Fund's
investment  performance to the performance of a universe of registered  funds of
hedge funds compiled by an independent  third party,  including funds managed by
third  parties  and  another   registered  fund  managed  by  BAIA  (the  "Third
Party-Identified  Peer Group"),  and the Fund's  performance  benchmark;  (ii) a
report  prepared by BAIA comparing the Fund's  advisory fees and other expenses,
including  information  comparing  the  Fund's  expenses  to those of the  Third
Party-Identified  Peer Group,  and a report  prepared by the  independent  third
party comparing the Fund's expenses to those of the Third  Party-Identified Peer
Group; (iii) information about the profitability of the Management  Agreement to
BAIA and potential "fall-out" or ancillary benefits that BAIA and its affiliates
may  receive  as a  result  of  their  relationships  with  the  Fund;  and (iv)
information  obtained  through  BAIA's  and  Grosvenor's  response  to a  letter
prepared at the request of the  Directors  by their  independent  legal  counsel
requesting  certain  information  in  connection  with the renewal of the Fund's
Advisory  Agreements.  The Board also considered  other  information such as (v)
BAIA's financial  results and BAIA's and Grosvenor's  financial  condition;  and
(vi) BAIA's and Grosvenor's  resources devoted to, and their respective  records
of compliance with, the Fund's investment policies and restrictions, policies on
personal securities  transactions and other compliance policies.  Throughout the
process,  the  Directors  had the  opportunity  to ask questions of, and request
additional  materials  from,  BAIA  and  Grosvenor  and to  consult  with  their
independent  legal  counsel.  The Board also referred to  information  about the
Fund's  investment   process  that  it  received  from  Grosvenor's   investment
professionals at previous meetings throughout the year.

In considering  whether to approve the continuation of the Advisory  Agreements,
the  Directors  did not identify any single  factor as  determinative,  and each
weighed various factors as he deemed appropriate.  The Directors  considered the
following  matters in connection with their approval of the  continuation of the
Advisory Agreements:

                                       20

<PAGE>


               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

         Investment Contract Renewal Disclosure (unaudited) (continued)


NATURE,  EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES  PROVIDED.  The Board considered the
nature,  quality  and  extent  of the  advisory  services  provided  by BAIA and
Grosvenor under the Advisory  Agreements.  It considered the investment approach
Grosvenor employs,  Grosvenor's research capabilities,  the nature of BAIA's and
Grosvenor's  experience  and  resources,  the  experience  of relevant  BAIA and
Grosvenor  personnel,  and  BAIA's  and  Grosvenor's  resources,  practices  and
procedures designed to address regulatory compliance matters.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board reviewed the Fund's investment performance and
the performance of the funds in the Third Party-Identified Peer Group. The Board
reviewed the factors that Grosvenor identified as contributing to performance.

EXPENSE INFORMATION,  PROFITABILITY AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board considered
the fees payable  under the Fund's  Advisory  Agreements  and the fact that BAIA
pays  Grosvenor's  subadvisory  fees out of the advisory fees that BAIA receives
from the Fund.  The Board also  considered the incentive  allocation  payable to
Grosvenor and BAIA. The Board reviewed the Fund's fees and expenses and the fees
and expenses of other comparable registered funds of hedge funds included in the
Third  Party-Identified  Peer  Group.  The  Board  also  considered  information
regarding  the advisory  fees paid by a similar  registered  fund of hedge funds
managed by BAIA that was included in the Third  Party-Identified Peer Group. The
Board noted BAIA's  stated  justification  for the advisory  fees charged to the
Fund, which included information about performance and services.

The Board  reviewed the actual  dollar amount of fees paid to BAIA and Grosvenor
under the Advisory Agreements and BAIA's expenses in providing its services and,
in this context,  considered the fact that BAIA or its affiliates  provide other
services to the Fund and its investors and receive  payment for these  services.
The Board also  considered  so-called  "fall-out"  benefits to BAIA, such as any
incremental  increase  to its  reputation  derived  from  serving as  investment
adviser to the Fund.

In addition,  the Board considered  possible  economies of scale with respect to
the  management  of the Fund that  might be  realized  at  different  Fund asset
levels. In this regard,  the Board considered the Fund's existing and reasonably
foreseeable asset levels and information relating to BAIA's costs.

OTHER  CONSIDERATIONS.  The Board  also  considered  the  terms of the  Advisory
Agreements, including the applicable standard of care, and the structure of, and
the  method  used  to  determine,  the  compensation  of  Grosvenor's  portfolio
managers.  In  addition,  the  Board  considered  the  extent  to which the Fund
operated  in  accordance  with  its  investment  objective  and  its  record  of
compliance with its investment restrictions,  and the compliance programs of the
Fund, BAIA and Grosvenor.

Based on these considerations and following deliberation and discussion, in open
session with representatives of BAIA and Grosvenor and in executive session with
independent legal counsel,  the Directors  concluded that (i) BAIA and Grosvenor
had the capabilities,  resources and personnel necessary to fulfill their duties
under the Advisory Agreements; (ii) the scope and quality of services


                                       21

<PAGE>


               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

         Investment Contract Renewal Disclosure (unaudited) (continued)



provided  under  the  Advisory   Agreements  are  consistent   with  the  Fund's
operational  requirements;  (iii)  the  advisory  fees  paid to BAIA  under  the
Management  Agreement as well as the incentive  allocation  payable to BAIA were
reasonable  in light of the services  that BAIA provides and the costs that BAIA
incurs;  (iv) the  subadvisory  fees paid to  Grosvenor  under  the  Subadvisory
Agreement  as  well  as the  incentive  allocation  payable  to  Grosvenor  were
reasonable  in  light  of the  services  that  Grosvenor  provides;  (v)  BAIA's
profitability  in providing  advisory  services to the Fund was reasonable;  and
(vi) there was no  potential  for  economies of scale to be realized by BAIA and
Grosvenor in managing the Fund given the current and  foreseeable  asset size of
the Fund.  Based on their  evaluation  of all  factors  that  they  deemed to be
material, including those factors described above, and assisted by the advice of
independent  legal  counsel,  the  Directors  approved  the  continuance  of the
Advisory Agreements.
