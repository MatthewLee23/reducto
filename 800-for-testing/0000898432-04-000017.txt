CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report of the Neuberger Berman
Municipal Closed-End Funds, for the period ending October 31, 2003. The report
includes a listing of the Fund's investments and its financial statements for
the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide current income exempt from
regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific Fund, current income
exempt from that state's income taxes.

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds (maturities between three and
eight years) because our experience and research indicates strongly that this
maturity range has historically offered the best risk/reward profile on the
yield curve, providing much of the return of longer-term bonds--with less
volatility and risk.

We believe our conservative investing philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior tax-exempt current income over the long
term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to keep earning it.

Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS PORTFOLIO COMMENTARIES

In their first year of operation, the Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal
closed-end funds achieved our objective of providing shareholders with stability
and income through investing in high-quality municipal securities portfolios. In
addition, we are pleased to report that on a Net Asset Value basis, all three of
Neuberger Berman's Intermediate Municipal closed-end funds outperformed their
Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index benchmark in fiscal 2003.

In the second half of fiscal 2003, record new issuance, accompanied by softening
demand, resulting in part from investors moving back into the rallying stock
market, put downward pressure on municipal securities prices. Also, like the
Federal government, states and municipalities are confronted by declining tax
revenues and rising deficits, spawning investor concern regarding credit
quality. General Obligation bonds (GOs) came under pressure. New York and
California GOs were among the bigger casualties as huge state budget deficits
made headline news. Essential service (electric, water, and sewer) revenue
bonds, which are secured by revenues from essential service projects,
outperformed GOs.

In this unsettled environment, we have had to be quite nimble in all facets of
our investment strategy, altering portfolio weighted average maturity (WAM) and
duration in response to interest rate swings; shifting sector allocation to
sidestep problem areas and take advantage of evolving opportunities; and most
importantly, diligently evaluating credit quality. As the Funds' relative
performance indicates, we did a good job on all fronts.

Coming off a four-year bull market, bonds may be ready to take a breather. With
the economy gaining momentum, we can probably expect higher interest rates in
the year ahead. Regardless of what the fixed-income markets have in store for us
in the year ahead, we believe our commitment to quality, our securities
selection prowess, and our active duration management and sector allocation
strategies can add value. Markets will go up and down, but we will never waver
from our commitment to diligent research and "safety first" portfolio
management.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered. There is
an initial public offering and once issued, common shares of closed-end funds
are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investment securities of the Fund are valued daily by obtaining bid price
     quotations from independent pricing services on all securities available in
     each service's data base. For all other securities requiring daily
     quotations, bid prices are obtained from principal market makers in those
     securities or, if quotations are not available, by a method the directors
     of Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund
     Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", collectively, the "Funds"),
     believe accurately reflects fair value. Numerous factors may be considered
     when determining the fair value of a security, including available analyst,
     media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer
     of the security being fair valued has other securities outstanding.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.

@    Municipal securities held by the Funds are within the four highest rating
     categories (with respect to at least 80% of total assets) assigned by a
     nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") such as
     Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Investors
     Services, Inc. or, where not rated, are determined by the Funds' investment
     manager to be of comparable quality. Approximately 79%, 73%, and 56% of the
     municipal securities held by California, Intermediate, and New York,
     respectively, have credit enhancement features backing them, which the
     Funds may rely on, such as letters of credit, insurance, or guarantees.
     Without these credit enhancement features the securities may or may not
     meet the quality standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported
     by securities in escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its
     agencies, or instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay
     the periodic interest due and the principal of these bonds. Putable bonds
     give the Funds the right to sell back the issue on the date specified.

^    Credit ratings are unaudited.

++   Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

**   Security exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. These
     securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration, normally
     to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A. At October 31, 2003
     these securities amounted to $2,542,000 or 0.85% of net assets for
     Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund
     Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", collectively, the "Funds") were
     organized as Maryland corporations on July 29, 2002. California and New
     York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end management investment
     companies and Intermediate is registered as a diversified, closed-end
     management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended (the "1940 Act"). Each Fund had no operations until September 27,
     2002, other than matters relating to their organization and the sale on
     September 19, 2002 of 6,981 shares of common stock for $100,005 ($14.325
     per share) from each Fund to Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), the
     Funds' sub-adviser. The Board of Directors of the Funds may classify or
     re-classify any unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes
     of preferred stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States requires Neuberger
     Berman Management Inc. ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at
     the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
     those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income, including accretion of
     discount (adjusted for original issue discount, where applicable) and
     amortization of premium, where applicable, is recorded on the accrual
     basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded
     on the basis of identified cost.

4    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the policy of each Fund to continue to qualify
     as a regulated investment company by complying with the provisions
     available to certain investment companies, as defined in applicable
     sections of the Internal Revenue Code, and to make distributions of
     investment company taxable income and net capital gains (after reduction
     for any amounts available for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as capital
     loss carryforwards) sufficient to relieve them from all, or substantially
     all, U.S. Federal income taxes. Accordingly, each Fund paid no U.S. Federal
     income taxes and no provision for U.S. Federal income taxes was required.

5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net of
     expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to
     declare and pay dividends to common shareholders from net investment income
     on a monthly basis. Distributions from net realized capital gains, if any,
     are normally distributed in December. Income dividends and capital gain
     distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
     To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be offset

                                       24
<Page>

     by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not to
     distribute such gains. Dividends and distributions to preferred
     shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-6. At
     October 31, 2003, the capital loss carryforwards for each Fund were as
     follows:

</Table>

     Each Fund distinguishes between dividends on a tax basis and a financial
     reporting basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and
     profits are reported in the financial statements as a tax return of
     capital. Differences in the recognition or classification of income between
     the financial statements and tax earnings and profits which result in
     temporary over-distributions for financial statement purposes are
     classified as distributions in excess of net investment income or
     accumulated net realized gains in the components of net assets on the
     Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

     Subsequent to October 31, 2003, each Fund declared dividends to common
     shareholders from their net investment income payable December 15, 2003, to
     shareholders of record on November 28, 2003, with an ex-dividend date of
     November 25, 2003, as follows:

     As of October 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as follows:

     The difference between book basis and tax basis is attributable primarily
     to timing differences of dividend payments.

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to
     that Fund. Expenses not directly attributed to a Fund are allocated, on the
     basis of relative net assets, except where a more appropriate allocation of
     expenses to each of the Funds can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds re-classified
     unissued shares of capital stock into several series of Auction Market
     Preferred Shares ("AMPS"), as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
     FUND                 SERIES A SHARES   SERIES B SHARES
     <S>                            <C>               <C>

</Table>

     On December 13, 2002, the Funds issued several series of AMPS, as follows:

<Table>

     NEW YORK                         965               965
</Table>

     All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000
     per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends, whether or not earned or
     declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").
     Dividends to AMPS shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily. It
     is the policy of each Fund to pay dividends every 7 days for each Fund's
     AMPS Series A and every 28 days for each Fund's AMPS Series B, unless in a
     special rate period.

     In the absence of a special rate period, dividend rates are reset every 7
     days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an auction.
     Each Fund's AMPS Series A has approved a special rate period of 728 days
     for California and New York and 546 days for Intermediate. The effective
     dates and dividend rates for each Fund are as follows:

<Table>

     NEW YORK             October 22, 2003             1.70%
</Table>

     In the absence of a special rate period, dividend rates are reset every 28
     days for each Fund's AMPS Series B, based on the results of an auction.
     Each Fund's AMPS Series B has approved a special rate period of 364 days.
     The effective dates and dividend rates for each Fund are as follows:

</Table>

                                       26
<Page>

     The Funds declared dividends to AMPS shareholders for the period November
     1, 2003 to November 30, 2003, for each series of the AMPS as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
     FUND            SERIES A SHARES         SERIES B SHARES
     <S>             <C>                     <C>
     CALIFORNIA      $        41,798         $        28,269
     INTERMEDIATE            123,328                  89,688
     NEW YORK                 34,182                  22,622
</Table>

     The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part, on
     the second business day preceding any dividend payment date at Liquidation
     Value.

     The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
     Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
     declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
     shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation
     Value.

     The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless
     otherwise required by law, will vote with holders of common stock as a
     single class, except that the AMPS will vote separately as a class on
     certain matters, as required by law. The holders of AMPS, voting as a
     separate class, are entitled at all times to elect two Directors of each
     Fund, and to elect a majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund failed
     to pay dividends on preferred shares for two consecutive years.

8    ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay all
     organizational expenses and the amount by which each Fund's offering costs
     for common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03 per share. The costs
     incurred by management were approximately $261,029, $276,501, and $289,752
     for California, Intermediate and New York, respectively. Offering costs for
     common stock paid by each Fund were charged as a reduction of common stock
     paid-in-capital at the completion of each Fund's offerings and amounted to
     $203,759, $620,459, and $167,159 for California, Intermediate, and New
     York, respectively.

     Additionally, offering costs of $154,612, $337,770, and $143,704 and sales
     loads of $590,000, $1,794,000, and $482,500 for AMPS for California,
     Intermediate, and New York, respectively, were charged as a reduction of
     common stock paid-in-capital for each Fund's AMPS shares offering.

9    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
     held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
     developments, including those particular to a specific industry or region.
     The investment policies of California and New York involve investing
     substantially all of their assets in California state and New York state
     municipal bonds, respectively. This policy makes those funds more
     susceptible to adverse economic, political, regulatory or other factors
     affecting the issuers of such municipal bonds than a fund that does not
     limit its investments to such issuers.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its

                                       27
<Page>

     average daily Managed Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the
     Fund, less liabilities other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into
     for purposes of leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the
     Liquidation Value of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the following annual
     rates:

                     2008                                       0.20
                     2009                                       0.15
                     2010                                       0.10
                     2011                                       0.05
</Table>

     Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
     31, 2011.

     For the year ended October 31, 2003, such waived fees amounted to $374,824,
     $1,144,348, and $306,706 for California, Intermediate, and New York,
     respectively.

     Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement ("Agreement"). Pursuant to this Agreement each Fund pays
     Management an administration fee at the annual rate of 0.30% of its average
     daily Managed Assets. Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank
     and Trust Company ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a
     Sub-Administration Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all
     services received under the agreement.

     On October 31, 2003, Management and Neuberger, a member firm of The New
     York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to each Fund, became indirect wholly
     owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly held
     company ("the Transaction"). Upon completion of the Transaction, each
     Fund's management and sub-advisory agreements automatically terminated. To
     provide for continuity of management, the shareholders of each Fund voted
     on September 23, 2003, to approve new management and sub-advisory
     agreements, which took effect upon closing of the Transaction (see Report
     of Votes of Shareholders). Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish
     it with investment recommendations and research information without added
     cost to each Fund. Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of
     each Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

     Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
     custodian contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected in the
     Statements of Operations under the caption Custodian fees, was a reduction
     of $854, $810, and $808 for California, Intermediate, and New York,
     respectively.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the broker-dealer.

                                       28
<Page>

     In order to satisfy ratings agency requirements, each Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that it is
     maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or greater
     than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a minimum
     level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to maintain the
     AAA rating on the AMPS. 'Discounted value' refers to the fact that the
     rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this calculation, to
     discount portfolio securities below their face value, at a rate depending
     on their rating. Each Fund pays a fee to State Street, as Fund
     sub-administrator, for the preparation of this report.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under each Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. For each Fund, total
     return would have been lower if Management had not waived the investment
     management fee.

     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

     such action the annualized ratios of net expenses to average daily net

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, of Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and
Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. (the "Funds") as of
October 31, 2003, the related statements of operations for the year then ended,
the statements of changes in net assets for the year ended October 31, 2003, and
for the period from September 27, 2002 (commencement of operations) to October
31, 2002 and financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2003, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers or other appropriate auditing procedures where replies
from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each
of Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger
Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and Neuberger Berman New York
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. at October 31, 2003, the results of their

ended October 31, 2003 and for the period from September 27, 2002 (commencement
of operations) to October 31, 2002, and their financial highlights for each of
the periods indicated therein, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (UNAUDITED)

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
pursuant to which all holders of common stock ("Common Stockholders") whose
shares are registered in their own names will have all dividends and any capital
gain distributions (referred to collectively in this section as "dividends") on
their shares automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock
("Common Shares") by The Bank of New York, as agent for the Common Stockholders
("Plan Agent"), unless such Common Stockholders elect to receive cash. An
election to receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at a Common Stockholder's
option. In the case of record Common Stockholders such as banks, brokers or
other nominees that hold shares of common stock for others who are the
beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the
number of shares certified from time to time by the record Common Stockholder as
representing the total amount registered in such Common Stockholder's name and
held for the account of beneficial owners who participate in the Plan. Common
Stockholders whose shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other
nominee should contact the nominee for details. Such stockholders may not be
able to transfer their shares to another nominee and continue to participate in
the Plan. All dividends to investors who elect not to participate in the Plan
(or whose bank, broker or other nominee elects not to participate on the
investor's behalf), will be paid in cash by check mailed, in the case of direct
Common Stockholders, to the record holder by The Bank of New York, as the Fund's
dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your bank, broker or other nominee) elect not to participate in
the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will receive as a result of a Fund
dividend will be determined as follows:

     (1)  If Common Shares are trading at or above their net asset value (minus
          estimated brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the
          purchase of Common Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the
          Fund will issue new Common Shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
          value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market
          price per Common Share on the payment date. Because Common Shares may
          be issued at less than their market price, Plan participants may get a
          benefit that non-participants do not.

     (2)  If Common Shares are trading below their net asset value (minus
          estimated brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the
          purchase of Common Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the
          Plan Agent will receive the dividend in cash and will purchase Common
          Shares in the open market, on the American Stock Exchange or
          elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
          market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent
          has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per
          Common Share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
          thereof on the payment date, resulting in the purchase of fewer Common
          Shares than if the dividend had been paid in Common Shares issued by
          the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends received in cash to
          purchase Common Shares in the open market on or shortly after the
          payment date, but in no event later than the ex-dividend date for the
          next dividend. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
          payments.

If you own Common Shares directly, you may withdraw from the Plan at any time by
giving written notice to the Plan Agent; please be sure to include your name and
account number. You may also rejoin the Plan later. Contact the Plan Agent at
the following address for information on how to do so: The Bank of New York,
ATTN: Stock Transfer Administration, 101 Barclay Street, 11-E, New York, New
York 10286. If you wish, the Plan Agent will sell the Common Shares and send you
the proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all stockholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
stockholders may need for tax records. The Plan Agent will also furnish each
Common Stockholder with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive dividends in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares held
for you under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends in Common
Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market purchases.

                                       35
<Page>

Automatically reinvested dividends are taxed in the same manner as cash
dividends.

The Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund
reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the
participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from your
broker or by calling The Bank of New York at 1-800-524-4458.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that from time to time the Fund may purchase shares of its
common stock in the open market at market prices.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]


ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Board has  delegated  to  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger  Berman") the
responsibility  to vote  proxies  related to the  securities  held in the Fund's
portfolios.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by the Board to
vote proxies  related to portfolio  securities in the best interests of the Fund
and its  stockholders.  The Board  permits  Neuberger  Berman to contract with a
third party to obtain proxy voting and related services,  including  research of
current issues.
<PAGE>

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger  Berman has voting  authority,  including the Fund. The Proxy
Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman  addresses any conflicts that
may arise  between its  interests and those of its clients with respect to proxy
voting.

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.


ITEM 8. [RESERVED]


ITEM 9. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)    Based on an  evaluation of the  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as
       defined in rule  30a-2(c)  under the Act) as of a date  within 90 days of
       the  filing  date of this  document,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and
       Treasurer  and  Principal   Financial  and  Accounting   Officer  of  the
       Registrant  have concluded that such  disclosure  controls and procedures
       are  effectively  designed  to ensure  that  information  required  to be
       disclosed  by the  Registrant  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the
       Registrant's  management  to allow timely  decisions  regarding  required
       disclosure.

(b)    There were no significant  changes in the Registrant's  internal controls
       over financial reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that
       occurred  during  the  Registrant's  second  fiscal  half-year  that have
       materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
       Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 10. EXHIBITS

(a)    A copy of the Code of Ethics is filed as Exhibit 10(a)(1).

       of 1940, as amended,  and Sections 302 and 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF NEUBERGER BERMAN FUNDS

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

This code of ethics ("Code") for the registered  investment companies within the
Neuberger  Berman Fund complex  (each,  a "Company")  applies to each  Company's
Principal   Executive  Officer,   Principal   Financial  Officer  and  Principal
Accounting  Officer (the "Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is listed in Exhibit
A). The purpose of the Code is to promote:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent  conflicts  of  interest  between  personal  and  professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable  disclosure in reports
         and documents  that a Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Company;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to  an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  COVERED  OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE  ETHICALLY  ACTUAL,  POTENTIAL AND APPARENT
     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics  and  should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to actual,
potential and apparent conflicts of interest.

     An "actual  conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of,  or his or her  service  to,  the
Company.  For example,  a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a
result of his or her position with the Company.

     A "potential  conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest is such that it might, under certain circumstances,  interfere with the
interests  of the Company or the  Officer's  service to the  Company,  but those
circumstances do not now exist.


<PAGE>

     Appearances  may create an  "apparent  conflict of  interest"  even when an
actual conflict does not exist. For example, an apparent conflict may exist if a
Covered  Officer  owns a thinly  traded  security  that a series of a Company (a
"Fund") is buying, even if there is no actual conflict of interest.

     Certain  actual or  potential  conflicts  of interest  may arise out of the
relationships  between Covered  Officers and the Company and already are subject
to  conflict  of  interest  provisions  in the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940
("Investment  Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered  Officers may not  individually  engage in
certain  transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other
property)  with a Fund  because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" of the
Company.  The compliance  programs and procedures of Neuberger Berman Management
Inc.,  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  (collectively  referred  to as  the  "investment
adviser")  and each  Company are  designed to prevent,  or identify and correct,
violations  of these  provisions.  This Code does not,  and is not  intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  actual or potential  conflicts  may arise from, or as a result of, the
contractual relationship between the Company and the investment adviser of which
the Covered  Officers are also  officers or  employees.  As a result,  this Code
recognizes that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the Company or for the investment  adviser,  or for both),
be involved in establishing  policies and implementing  decisions that will have
different  effects on the  adviser and the  Company.  The  participation  of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship
between the  Company  and the  investment  adviser  and is  consistent  with the
performance by the Covered  Officers of their duties as officers of the Company.
Thus, if performed in conformity  with the provisions of the Investment  Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled  ethically.  In addition,  it is recognized by the Companies'  Boards of
Trustees/Directors  ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees  of one or more other  investment  companies  covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal interest
of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly before the interest of the
Company. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the
Code,  but  Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these  examples  are not
exhaustive.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships  improperly
         to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the

                                       2
<PAGE>

         Company,  as for  example  where  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
         personally to the detriment of the Company;

     o   cause the  Company  to take  action,  or fail to take  action,  for the
         individual  personal  benefit of the  Covered  Officer  rather than the
         benefit the Company;

     o   retaliate  against  any other  Covered  Officer,  or any  employee of a
         Company,  its service  providers,  or the affiliated  persons of any of
         them, for good faith reports of potential violations of this Code.

     There are some actual or  potential  conflict of interest  situations  that
should  always be approved by the  Company's  Chief Legal  Officer1 if material.
Covered  Officers are  encouraged  to discuss  with the Chief Legal  Officer any
potential conflict the materiality of which is uncertain. Examples of reportable
conflicts include:

     o   service  as a director  on the board of any public or private  company,
         other than the Companies, their investment adviser, and its affiliates;

     o   the  receipt of any non-nominal  gifts,  i.e., those in excess of $100;

     o   the  receipt  of any  entertainment  from any  company  with  which the
         Company  has  current or  prospective  business  dealings  unless  such
         entertainment is business-related,  reasonable in cost,  appropriate as
         to time and place,  and not so  frequent  as to raise any  question  of
         impropriety;

     o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
         adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o   a direct or indirect  financial  interest in  commissions,  transaction
         charges  or  spreads  paid  by  the  Company  for  effecting  portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming  shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment,  such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each  Covered  Officer  must  familiarize  himself or herself  with the
         disclosure  requirements  generally  applicable  to the Company and the
         Company's Disclosure Controls and Procedures;

     o   each Covered Officer must not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
         to misrepresent,  facts about the Company to others,  whether within or
         outside the Company, including to the Company's  trustees/directors and
         auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators   and   self-regulatory
         organizations;

- ----------------
1    The Board of each  Company has  appointed  Philip R. Carroll as Chief Legal
     Officer.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     o   each Covered Officer should,  to the extent  appropriate  within his or
         her area of  responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees
         of the Companies and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
         accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure  in the  reports  and
         documents the  Companies  file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
         public communications made by the Companies; and

     o   each Covered  Officer should promote  compliance with the standards and
         restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered  Officer),  affirm in  writing  to the Board that he or she has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

     o   annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board  that he or she has  complied
         with the requirements of the Code;

     o   report  on  the  Company's  Questionnaire  for  Trustees/Directors  and
         Officers,  where responsive to appropriate questions, all categories of
         affiliations or other relationships  giving rise to actual or potential
         conflicts of interest; and

     o   notify the Chief Legal Officer  promptly if he or she is aware of facts
         and  circumstances  that he or she knows are a violation  of this Code.
         Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is  responsible  for applying this Code to specific
situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the authority to
interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.2  However,  any approvals or
waivers3  sought by the  Principal  Executive  Officer will be considered by the
Independent Trustees/ Directors of the affected Company (the "Committee").

- ----------------
2    The Chief Legal  Officer is  authorized to consult,  as  appropriate,  with
     counsel to the Company and counsel to the  Independent  Trustees/Directors,
     and is encouraged to do so.
3    Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material  departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the  registrant's  failure to take action  within a  reasonable
     period of time regarding a material  departure from a provision of the code
     of  ethics  that  has  been  made  known to an  executive  officer"  of the
     registrant. Both waivers and implicit waivers must be disclosed publicly.


                                       4
<PAGE>

     The Companies will follow these procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any potential violations reported to him or her.

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will report to the Committee the outcome of the
         investigation, including the facts of the initial report, the scope and
         outcome  of the  investigation,  and  whether  or not the  Chief  Legal
         Officer believes that a violation occurred.

     o   The person who initially  reported the matter will be informed that the
         matter has been investigated and reported to the Committee.

     o   If the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred,  it will inform
         and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate
         action, which may include review of, and appropriate  modifications to,
         applicable   policies  and  procedures;   notification  to  appropriate
         personnel of the investment  adviser or its board; or a  recommendation
         to dismiss the Covered Officer.

     o   The Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

     o   Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code  shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted by the  Companies  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable  to  registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Companies,  the investment adviser, the Companies'
principal  underwriter,  or other  service  providers  purport to apply a lesser
standard  to the  behavior  or  activities  of the  Covered  Officers,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions of this Code. The Companies'  and the investment  adviser's  codes of
ethics  under Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company  Act and the  investment
adviser's more detailed  policies and  procedures set forth in Neuberger  Berman
Management Inc.'s Compliance  Manual are separate  requirements  applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not preempted by this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified  by a majority  vote of the Board,  including a majority of
Independent Trustees/Directors.

                                       5
<PAGE>

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed  to anyone  other  than the  appropriate  Company,  its Board (and any
Committee of the Board) and their counsel.

VIII.  INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Companies and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
