Letter to Stockholders

MARKET OVERVIEW
    Substantially all equity indices finished the first half of the year with
positive results, with emerging markets and the Eurozone registering double
digit returns.

    Liquidity in the global equity markets continued to be created by emerging
market central banks, which maintain massive foreign reserves. These monetary
policies will continue to help support global equity markets, with global
economic growth expected to stay around 5%.

    The continued strength of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity helped a
majority of the markets. Private equity firms have been heavy contributors to
this activity, accounting for 20% of the total M&A volume in 2006.

    However, the first half of the year saw an increase in volatility,
especially in March, on the back of higher interest rates and a combination of
higher inflation expectations coupled with strong economic growth in Asia and
in Europe. China also has added to market volatility, but with mitigated damage
because of the small size of its domestic equity market. High beta assets such
as emerging market equities, small capitalization stocks and cyclical
industrial companies continued to be the star performers for the first half of
2007. A possible deterioration of the credit cycle continues to loom as
investors, searching for yields, continue to underprice risk in certain
structured finance products.

SWISS MARKET OVERVIEW
    During the first half of 2007, the continuous strength of the industrial,
biotechnology, food and luxury goods sectors allowed the Swiss Performance
Index (SPI) to increase by 8.01% in US dollar terms, outperforming the
Standard & Poor's 500 average which returned 6.96%.

    Year-to-date stock market performance across continental Europe varied.
Germany clearly outperformed the rest of the pack, while Switzerland was
somewhat higher than the average. The SPI return was however also held back by
the strong influence of the pharmaceutical and financial sectors.

    The pharmaceutical industry subdued performance was due to pricing pressure
resulting from the production and sale of generic products, (especially from
companies in emerging markets who are becoming increasingly aggressive in their
intellectual property challenges), and from the lack of innovative new
products. The industry, in general, has been too conservative in drug research
and development, overemphasizing different versions of existing products and
over relying on marketing and distribution. Novartis, to some extent, is
impacted by these problems. Roche, on the other hand, is harvesting the fruits
of a more focused approach, benefiting from the strength of its oncology
franchise with Genentech and building up momentum in inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. Novartis, with its generics division, and Roche, with its
diagnostic business, are also developing strategies against the commoditization
of branded pharmaceuticals.

Letter to Stockholders (continued)


    The mid and small cap companies in the bio-pharmaceutical sector, in sharp
contrast to traditional large cap companies, performed quite well as they
continued to develop and market highly promising drugs.

    The financial sector in Switzerland is benefiting from strength in the
private banking and alternative asset management businesses. Performance in the
investment banking business, however, varied from bank to bank. Credit Suisse
has been doing reasonably well in this area while UBS has been struggling to
catch up to its competition and be in the top tier.

    The Swiss industrial sector has been very active with excellent performance
in 2007. The energy infrastructure, energy production (including renewable
energy), industrial and agricultural machinery sectors were all very strong,
and the backdrop for these sectors remains positive. Europe, being the largest
trading partner with 62% of exports (including 20% to Germany), is an important
contributor to this performance. For the first time in 15 years, European
growth in domestic demand is outpacing that of the United States. European
growth in non-residential investment has strongly accelerated since mid- 2005
to a pace not seen since 2000. Germany's recovery is an important factor to
European growth; as it emerges from a period of deflation and sees its total
rate of investment increase after bottoming out at an all time low in 2005.
This trend is likely to continue given the large percentage of companies still
owned by the government and likely to get privatized.

    Performance in the Swiss utilities sector varied as the development in
wholesale prices for electricity and CO/2/ rights was less favorable than in
the recent past. While the trend favoring strong pricing is still intact,
investors will continue to be concerned by the lack of visibility in government
policies pertaining to the environment for new investments.

    Top performing stocks for the first half of the year either had high betas
or were involved in M&A activity. The out-performance of small companies was
evident in the 25% return of the SPI Small Companies Index, as compared to the
6% return of the SPI Large Companies Index. The best sectors were Oil & Gas
(with Petroplus up 70%), and Retail (with Jelmoli, although much more a real
estate player, up 59%, and Galenica up 33%).

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
    At its last monetary policy assessment of June 14, 2007, the Swiss National
Bank (SNB) raised the target range for the three-month Libor by 25 basis points
to 2.00-3.00%. The Swiss economy developed even better than expected during the
last quarter. (Swiss economic growth accelerated by 0.8% versus consensus of
0.6%). The strongest contributors were household consumption (+0.7%) and
exports (+1.6%). Business activity is near a historic peak. (The Purchasing
Manager Index is at 62.8 versus its peak of 67.7). Capacity utilization rates
are high and employment growth is strong. (The unemployment rate is now at
2.7%). The KOF Swiss economic institute leading economic

                                      3

indicator of business has increased every month this year starting at 1.74 on
December 29, 2006 and finishing the first six months of 2007 at 1.98. The
consumer confidence indicator has also increased steadily reaching 20 (up from
two in December 2005). Given the healthy economic situation, the SNB increased
its forecast for real GDP growth from 2% to 2.5% for the whole year.

    Due to a renewed rise in oil prices, stronger than expected economic
performance and the pressure on the Swiss franc, exercised in part by the carry
trade (funding investment in high yielding currencies by borrowing in low
yielding currencies), the SNB has increased its inflation projection to 0.8%
for 2007 (up from 0.5%); to 1.5% for 2008 (up from 1.4%); and to 1.7% for 2009
(up from 1.6%). With the current high level of capacity utilization, and the
resulting upside bias to wages, there is some likelihood that production costs
will be passed on to consumers. However, this may be offset by an increase in
productivity as a result of an accelerated pace of investment in infrastructure.

    Despite continuing increases in short term interest rates, the yield curve
is not flattening, because long term rates also are increasing in response to
the positive economic outlook. The yield on the ten year bond was at 2.5% on
December 29, 2006 and finished at 3.2% on June 29, 2007.

    The euro has remained very strong against the Swiss franc, supported by
higher nominal yields. This currency backdrop continues to help Swiss exports
to the Eurozone. The US dollar was especially volatile during the second
quarter. In April, it reached an intermediate low point of 1.19 Swiss francs in
reaction to a report of disappointing US existing homes sales but rebounded
later to 1.24 and ended the second quarter at 1.22.

    Despite some improvement in the overall trade balance, the US dollar
continues on its path of weakness. Investors expect interest rate differentials
to narrow between Europe (including Switzerland) and the United States. The
high level of mortgage debt is having a deflationary impact on real estate
prices in the United States and therefore consumer spending is under pressure.
In this context, there is the increased probability that the Federal Reserve
Board's next move will be to cut interest rates. On the other side, the current
level of activity in Europe appears to be sustainable as domestic demand
supported by real wage increases is becoming the second engine of growth after
exports.

FUND PERFORMANCE
    Prior to the expiration of the fund's rights offering at the end of the
quarter, the fund's performance was slightly ahead of the SPI. Its relative
performance was helped by its underweight in Novartis and UBS, but hurt by its
underweight in Nestle and industrial companies and its overweight in utilities
and Actelion (which was about flat for the first six months after very good
performance in 2006).

    Management's approach of trying to minimize market risk (for example the
exposure to macro factors such as the global

                                      4

economic cycle and M&A activity) combined with a search for company specific
triggers in its investment choices has led to under-exposing the fund to the
sector that benefited the most from the economic upswing. Since the tide of
global growth has lifted all boats, this selectivity has not yet paid off.
Management expects that more difficult economic conditions and a little less
liquidity in the stock markets, will force investors to discriminate more in
the positions they take, and that should help validate the fund's investment
approach.

SWISS MARKET QUARTERLY CORPORATE NEWS
    SWX (Swiss stock exchange group), SIS (clearing specialist group) and
Telekurs (financial data group) announced on May 15, 2007 plans to merge into
and under a single holding company. The transaction is expected to take effect
in early 2008. These three groups are complementary. The main drivers of the
combination are to strengthen Switzerland's financial market infrastructure,
thereby making it a competitive global player, and heighten efficiency and
innovation across the entire value chain. This open multi-provider architecture
should afford unhindered access to possibilities for international
collaboration, enabling the three groups to realize joint projects more rapidly
and to be more internationally anchored.

    Credit Suisse and UBS would be holders of approximately 1/3 of the share
capital of the new holding company. The proposal remains to be accepted by the
shareholders at extraordinary general meetings of the three groups. We see this
as positive news for the Swiss market.

CORPORATE NEWS
    On May 29, 2007, Jelmoli sold its household electronics and multimedia
unit, Fust, to the Swiss Coop Group for 900 million Swiss francs. Pending
regulatory approval, this sale confirms Jelmoli's strategy to extract value by
focusing on real estate as its sole business.

    On June 18, 2007, Adecco announced that it will acquire Tuja Group of
Germany for a total of 800 million euros. This acquisition should significantly
increase Adecco's market position in Germany, where the job market has been
improving significantly with the unemployment rate declining from 12% in March
2005 to 9.1% in June 2007.

    On June 26, 2007, Roche launched an unsolicited offer for all outstanding
shares of Ventana Medical systems for $75.00 per share in cash ($3 billion).
Ventana is the leader in histopathology (tissue-based diagnostics). This should
help Roche build a strong position in cancer diagnostics, an area where Roche
has not had much previous exposure.

    On June 26, 2007, Galenica's iron replacement product, Ferinject, was
approved by the European Union. It has been submitted for approval in
Switzerland and the US, where such approval is expected later this year.

OUTLOOK
    We believe the Swiss market continues to have upside potential. The recent
performance of the Swiss market has eliminated most of the premium to the rest
of Europe that the market had built up over the preceding four years, pushing
multiples towards the low end of the range during that period. Moreover, in
comparison to companies in Europe and the US, the balance sheets of Swiss
corporations are historically overcapitalized and have become even more so
during the last four years. Investors are increasing pressure on companies to
buy back shares, increase leverage and/or participate in the global M&A market.

    Management's recent visits to private and public companies and its
discussions with venture capitalists and private equity investors have
confirmed its view of Switzerland as a center of innovation and
entrepreneurship with leadership in financial, engineering, machinery, new
energy (solar, wind, mini-hydro, geothermal) and healthcare, preserving its
potential for new investments.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.
The Fund also may acquire and hold equity and equity-linked securities of
non-Swiss companies in limited instances, as fully described in its prospectus.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity
securities that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund
uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities, the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. If a current bid price is not
available, the Fund uses the mean between the latest quoted bid and asked
prices. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the responsibility of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") to
establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that
are available are considered unreliable, the Fund determines a fair value in
good faith in accordance with these procedures. The Fund may use these
procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund
may value the securities at their last reported price or at some other value.
There were no fair valued securities on June 30, 2007.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend income, net of any foreign taxes withheld, is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated expenses are also accrued
daily.

The Fund records Swiss withholding tax as a reduction of dividend income, net
of any amount reclaimable from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax
treaty between the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends at least annually to the extent it has any net
investment income and net realized gains from foreign currency transactions and
makes distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed
any capital loss carryforwards. The Fund determines the size and nature of
these distributions in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Distributions may be paid either in cash or in stock with an option to take
cash. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its books on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and
to distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Therefore, no federal
income tax provision is required.

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. See Note 5 for Federal income tax treatment of foreign currency
gain/losses.

F. SECURITIES LENDING INCOME
The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions. The Fund retains
beneficial ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any

                                      20

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

changes in their market value. For the initial transaction, the Fund requires
the borrowers of the securities to establish collateral with the Fund in the
form of cash and/or government securities equal to 105% of the value of the
securities loaned. Subsequent to the initial transaction, the Fund requires the
borrowers to maintain collateral with the Fund equal to 100% of the value of
the securities loaned. The Fund receives fees as compensation for lending its
securities. Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the securities loan
at any time. There were no securities on loan during the period ended June 30,
2007.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting records in U.S. dollars. The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and
transactions by using prevailing exchange rates. The cost basis of foreign
denominated assets & liabilities is determined on the date that they are first
recorded within the Fund and translated to U.S. dollars. These assets and
liabilities are subsequently valued each day at prevailing exchange rates. The
difference between the original cost and current value denominated in U.S.
dollars is recorded as Unrealized Currency Gain/Loss. In valuing assets and
liabilities, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing securities transactions, the receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations
shown on the Fund's financial statements result from the sale of foreign
currencies, from currency gains or losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between
the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on
the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid.

When calculating realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in
equity securities, the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the foreign currency price of the security from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain
(loss) are disclosed separately.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

NOTE 2--FEES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Hottinger Capital Corp. ("HCC"), which is owned jointly by Hottinger U.S., Inc.
and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich), is the Fund's advisor (the "Advisor"). The Fund

During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Committee allocated $19,975 of
expenses incurred in connection with publicizing the Fund as follows: $9,987 to
the Fund and $9,988 to the Advisor.

portfolio accounting services to the Fund.

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the Fund's transfer agent. The Fund

responsibility to Citibank, N.A. the transfer was completed on January 16,
2007. The Fund pays the custodian an annual fee.

The Fund pays each director who is not an interested person (as such term is
defined in the Act) of the Fund, its Advisor, or Citigroup, approximately
$30,268 per annum in compensation, except for the Chairman of the Board to whom
the Fund pays an annual fee of approximately $42,568 and for the Chairmen of
the Audit Committee and the Governance/Nominating Committee to each of whom the
Fund pays an annual fee of approximately $35,567. In addition, the Fund pays
each disinterested Director $1,300 for each Board meeting attended; each
disinterested Director who is a member of a Committee a fee of $750 for each
Committee meeting attended and each disinterested Director who is a member of
the Ad Hoc Rights Offering Committee a fee of $1,000 for each Committee meeting
attended. Committee meeting fees are paid for only those meetings held
separately from other meetings. In addition, the Fund reimburses directors who
are not employees of or affiliated with the Advisor for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in conjunction with attendance at meetings.

Directors' fees and expenses payable of $15,595 shown on the Statements of
Assets & Liabilities represents total dollars owed to Directors that have been
accrued and not paid. Directors' fees and expenses of $272,688 shown on the
Statement of Operations represent the portion of Directors' fees and expenses

calculated by projecting Directors' fees contractually owed and adding
estimates of reimbursable expenses based on historical activity.

NOTE 5--FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Reclassifications are made to the Fund's capital accounts to reflect income and
gains available for distribution (or available capital loss carryforward) under
income tax regulations. The tax character of distributions paid during the year
and the tax components of net assets will be updated at the Fund's fiscal
year-end.

At December 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

Gains from foreign currency transactions will be treated as ordinary income for
Federal income tax purposes.

For tax purposes, post-October 2006 loss was $155,222. This loss was recognized
for tax purposes on January 2, 2007.

The aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, other
than short-term obligations, for the six months ended June 30, 2007, were
$80,523,482 and $84,489,917, respectively.

NOTE 6--STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1999 and has
continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio. The Board has authorized the Fund to repurchase up to
500,000 shares during 2007. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Fund
did not repurchase or retire any shares.

NOTE 7--LINE OF CREDIT
The Fund has entered into a line of credit agreement with the custodian to be
used for temporary purposes. The agreement provides that the Fund may borrow up
to an aggregate amount not to exceed $45,000,000 at any one time. The Fund pays
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each advance made to it from the day
of such advance until such principal amount is paid in full. The interest is
payable in arrears on demand, or if no demand has been made, on the last day of
the interest period for such advance, pursuant to the agreement.

As of June 30, 2007, the Fund had no loans outstanding under the line of
credit. During the six months ended June 30, 2007 the average borrowing was
$20.6 million and the average interest rate was 2.26%.

NOTE 8--RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109" (the "Interpretation"). The Interpretation establishes for
all entities, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the
benefit of positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity
is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax
disclosures. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006, and is required to be implemented by calendar year
closed-end funds by no later than June 29, 2007. Fund management has determined
that the Fund did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax
positions taken in the current or prior reporting periods that would require
reporting under FIN 48.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 157, Fair Value Measurements, which
clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their
disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in
interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. Adoption of SFAS
157 requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time, the Fund is in the
process of reviewing the impact, if any, of the SFAS on the Fund's financial
statements.

NOTE 9--ADVISORY AGREEMENT APPROVAL
The continuance of the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and HCC
(the "Agreement") was approved by the Board at a meeting on May 24, 2007. The
Independent Directors met with representatives of HCC before the meeting and
evaluated information that they deemed necessary to enable them to determine
that the Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement") would be in the best
interests of the Fund and its stockholders. Their evaluation included
information concerning the Fund's performance and expenses (including the fees
paid to HCC for its services), the nature, extent and quality of the services
HCC provided to the Fund, the financial position and profitability of HCC, and
other benefits that HCC or its parent derived from managing the Fund.

The Independent Directors reviewed the Fund's investment performance,
determining that the relevant measures should be in terms of its net asset
value as measured in Swiss francs because the Fund's portfolio securities and
cash were denominated in Swiss francs and because, as a matter of policy, the
Fund did not hedge its currency exposure. They compared the Fund's investment
performance for first quarter of 2007 and each of the past ten calendar years
with the Swiss Performance Index ("SPI"), with the performance of the Swiss
iShares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and with the performance of a
peer group of equity investment funds managed by Swiss advisers with publicly
available performance information. In comparing the Fund's performance with the
performance of the SPI, they considered the fact that, unlike the Fund, the
performance of the SPI did not include the impact of any expenses. As a result
of this evaluation, they concluded that the Fund's performance for the three
months of 2007 and each of the ten years ended 2006 was reasonable in relation
to the comparisons and outperformed them for the three-month 2007 period and on
a cumulative basis.

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (concluded)


The Independent Directors compared the Fund's one-, three- and five-year
investment performance in U.S. dollar terms with that of other U.S. registered
closed-end European country funds. While the Fund's performance was below that
of most of these other funds, the Independent Directors concluded that this was
due to performance differences of the Swiss market vs. the other European
countries and, to a lesser extent, the effect of the Swiss franc-U.S. dollar
exchange rates vs. the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rates and therefore was not an
indicator of HCC's investment performance.

The Independent Directors also evaluated the fees HCC charged the Fund for
investment advisory services as compared to the fees paid by U.S. registered
closed-end European country funds. They determined that the fees paid to HCC,
even when combined with the seven basis point administration fee paid to the
Fund's unaffiliated administrator, were among the lowest in each group. HCC
also had represented that the combined investment advisory fee and
administration fee was also lower than the fees HCC's parent charged to its
private advisory clients and to a Luxembourg-based fund it managed with similar
investment objectives and strategies.

The Independent Directors separately considered the fees charged by HCC
including breakpoints at various asset levels. They also took note of the
increase in the Fund's net assets that would result from the pending rights
offering, the related increase in advisory fees payable to HCC and where the
new asset level would fall on the breakpoint schedule. They concluded that the
breakpoints (which were voluntarily adjusted by HCC in 1998 to the benefit of
the Fund) allowed the Fund to share in economies of scale as its assets grew.

The Independent Directors evaluated the nature of the Fund, the creativity of
HCC in developing the Fund's investment strategies, and the complexity of the
Swiss securities market. They determined that HCC's services to the Fund were
highly professional and that the qualifications and number of HCC personnel,
the availability of company research and market and financial information from
HCC's parent in Switzerland, and the continuity of HCC personnel over time were
all desirable factors.

The Independent Directors considered the financial condition of HCC, noting
that the advisory fees it received from the Fund comprised the majority of its
income. They concluded that HCC's financial condition was sound and that its
profitability was reasonable for the services it provided to the Fund. They
considered other benefits that HCC or its parent could be considered to derive
from their relationship with the Fund including limited brokerage commissions
from executing Fund transactions, the marketing value of the Fund's performance
in attracting other clients, and the cost benefits to HCC of soft dollar
research and portfolio and financial information services. They determined that
these benefits were relatively minor and did not affect their overall
assessment of the reasonableness of the relationship.

Based on the evaluation of these factors and the assistance of independent
legal counsel, the Independent Directors concluded that the Fund's advisory fee
rate was reasonable in relation to the service to be rendered by HCC and
therefore recommended that the Board approve the continuance of the Agreement.

Additional Information (Unaudited)


   This report is sent to the stockholders of the Fund, for their information.
It is not a prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the
purchase or sale of shares of the Fund or of any securities mentioned in
this report.

Rights Offering

RESULTS
The Fund successfully concluded a rights offering on June 22, 2007, which
resulted in the issuance of an additional 8,149,552 shares of the Fund's common
stock. The Fund issued one right for every share held on the record date,
May 24, 2007, and three rights were required to subscribe for one additional
share. The final subscription price for a share of the Fund's common stock was
$16.60. The rights were transferable and traded on the New York Stock Exchange
from May 24, 2007 through June 22, 2007. The net proceeds to the Fund were
approximately $130 million after offering fees and expenses of $4.7 million.
The rationale for the rights offering was to allow the Fund to better take
advantage of current and future investment opportunities presented by the
prospects of a continuing positive economic environment and the Fund's
recently-broadened investment parameters. Management believes that it can
utilize the Fund's recently broadened investment strategies to seek attractive
investment opportunities in real estate, private equity and small and medium
sized companies. Management and the Fund's Board of Directors believed that the
rights offering was the most effective way to raise additional assets for the
Fund while offering stockholders the opportunity to buy additional shares of
the Fund at a discounted price.

PROCEEDS
As of August 24, 2007, the Fund has 4.2% of its total assets in cash. Since the
end of June, the Fund has increased its position in small- and mid-cap
industrial companies, including those involved with renewable energy, such as
OC Oerlikon and Komax, and other industrials like Schmolz and Bickenbach in the
high end steel business, and Petroplus in the oil refining business. The Fund
also has increased its position in certain bio-pharmaceutical companies, such
as Addex, and added new portfolio holdings in small- and mid-cap biotechnology
companies such as Bachem and Santhera. With respect to alternative investments,
the Fund has increased its position in an asset manager, Partners Group, and
also made two investments in private equity funds--one in buy-out and one in
venture capital. The Fund has not yet invested in the real estate sector, as
the Advisor is expecting a short-term consolidation in prices as a result of
recent increases in long-term interest rates. The Fund estimates that the
proceeds from the rights offering will be substantially invested in accordance
with its investment objective and policies within four to six months of the
completion of the offering, depending on the public or private nature of the
investment, which is ahead of the six to twelve months originally contemplated
prior to the offering.

Code of Ethics
The Board of Directors of the Fund and the Advisor have adopted Codes of Ethics
pursuant to provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Codes"). The
Codes apply to the personal investing activities of various individuals
including directors and officers of the Fund and designated officers, directors
and employees of the Advisor. The provisions of the Codes place restrictions on
individuals who are involved in managing the Fund's portfolio, who help execute
the portfolio manager's decisions or who come into possession of
contemporaneous information concerning the investment activities of the Fund.

   The fundamental principle of the Codes is that the individuals covered by
the Codes have a fiduciary responsibility to the Fund and its stockholders.
They are therefore required at all times to place the interests of the Fund and
the stockholders first and to conduct all personal securities transactions in a
manner so as to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest or abuse of
their position of trust.

   Portfolio managers and other individuals with knowledge of Fund investment
activities are prohibited from purchasing or selling a security during a
blackout period of 30 calendar days before and after the date on which the Fund
effects a trade in the same or a similar security. They are also prohibited
from engaging in short term trading of Swiss equity or equity linked
securities. Additionally, the Fund's portfolio managers are prohibited from
participating in any initial public offering or private placement of Swiss
equity and equity linked securities and other covered individuals must obtain
prior clearance before doing so.

   Any individual who violates the provisions of the Codes is required to
reverse the transaction and to turn over any resulting profits to the Fund. The
Fund and the Advisor have adopted compliance procedures and have appointed
compliance officers to ensure that all covered individuals comply with the
Codes.

Dividends Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

The Plan
The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest capital gains distributions and ordinary income dividends,
payable in whole or in part in cash, in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:

   . Once you enroll in the Plan, all of your future distributions and
     dividends payable in whole or in part in cash will be automatically
     reinvested in Fund shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
   . You will receive shares valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset value
     or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount of your
     distribution or dividend will be reinvested automatically in additional
     Fund shares. For any balance that is insufficient to purchase full shares
     of the Fund, your account will be credited with fractional shares.
   . Your shares will be held in an account with the Plan agent. You will be
     sent regular statements for your records.
   . You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

   The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

How do I enroll in the Plan?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (AST) at the address shown below. If your shares are
held in a brokerage account, contact your broker. Not all brokerage firms
permit their clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the
Plan and, even if your brokerage firm does permit participation, you may not be
able to transfer your Plan shares to another broker who does not permit
participation. Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its
policies.

How does the Plan work?
The cash portion of any dividends or distributions you receive, payable in
whole or in part in cash, will be reinvested in shares of the Fund. The number
of shares credited to your Plan account as a result of the reinvestment will
depend upon the relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset
value per share on the record date of the distribution or dividend, as
described below:

   . If the net asset value is greater than the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a discount), AST, as Plan Agent, will buy Fund shares for your
     account on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     Your dividends or distributions will be reinvested at the average price
     AST pays for those purchases.
   . If the net asset value is equal to the market price (the Fund is trading
     at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at net asset
     value.
   . If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
     (the Fund is trading at a premium of less than 5%), the Fund will issue
     for your account new shares at net asset value.
   . If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a premium of 5% or more), the Fund will issue for your account
     new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST begins to buy Fund shares for your account at a discount to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price
increases to a level above the net asset value, AST will complete its
purchases, even though

Dividends Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited) (concluded)

the result may be that the average price paid for the purchases exceeds net
asset value.

Will the entire amount of my distribution or dividend be reinvested?
The entire amount of your distribution or dividend, payable in cash, will be
reinvested in additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase
of whole shares, your account will be credited with any fractional shares
(rounded to three decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

How can I sell my shares?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan account by contacting AST.
AST charges $15 for the transaction plus $.10 per share for this service. You
can also withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

Does participation in the Plan change the tax status of my distributions or
dividends?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is
the same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of
distributions and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

Can I get certificates for the shares in the Plan?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates
for fractional shares will not be issued.

Is there any charge to participate in the Plan?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to AST's open market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

How can I discontinue my participation in the Plan?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account,
AST will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any
fractional shares.

Where can I direct my questions and correspondence?
Contact your broker, or contact AST as follows:

   By mail:
     American Stock Transfer & Trust
     Company
     PO Box 922
     Wall Street Station
