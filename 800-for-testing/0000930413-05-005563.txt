ITEM 1.  REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.


ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS: (unaudited)

     At May 31, 2005 the  Company's  net asset value was $41.38 per share.  This
compares  with $49.95 per share at November 30, 2004,  the end of the  Company's
previous fiscal year. The Company's most recent net asset value on July 21, 2005
was $43.87 per share.  On this date,  the closing market price of our shares was
$38.60 per share, a discount of 12% to the net asset value.

     Net  investment  income for the six months  ended May 31, 2005 was $.08 per
share vs. $.20 for the same period last year. The Board of Directors  declared a
semi-annual  dividend of $.20 per share on May 12, 2005  payable May 26, 2005 to
shareholders of record on May 19, 2005.

     At our annual meeting held on March 3, 2005 shareholders  reelected the ten
incumbent  directors,  ratified  the  selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as
auditors for the fiscal year ending  November 30, 2005 and approved  Amended and
Restated  Bye-Laws  of the  Company.  See  page 14 of this  report  for  details
regarding the results of the voting.

     I am pleased to report that at the reconvened  Special  General  Meeting of
Shareholders  held on July 21st, the  shareholders  approved all of the proposed
changes  to  certain  of  the  Company's  fundamental  investment  policies  and
restrictions and its subclassification under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Additional  information  regarding  these  changes is detailed in the  Company's
proxy statement dated April 15, 2005.

     The decline in our net investment income and the consequent  decline in our
dividend  payment  reflect the reduced  dividend  income received from our South
African gold stocks.  It also  reflects an increase in our  expenses,  including
wind-up  expenses  related  to the  closing of the ASA  Limited  office in South
Africa, professional fees and shareholder reports and proxy expenses incurred in
connection with the Special General Meeting of Shareholders.

     This reduced income from a portfolio  little changed from a year ago is due
almost  entirely  to an ongoing  strength  in the rand  relative  to the dollar.
Because  of this  strength  the price of gold when  expressed  in rand  declined
sharply  in 2002 and then  moved  sideways  until  March  of 2005.  Since  then,
however,  the rand has  weakened  and the rand  gold  price has  increased  from
approximately  2,500 rand per ounce to close to 2,900 rand per ounce  presently.
This positive  movement occurred too late in the period under review to have had
a material effect on earnings and dividends of our South African investments. If
it continues, however, its positive effects should be felt in the second half of
our fiscal year and this could result in an increase in our dividend income from
these companies.

     Although it is still early in the trend, we are encouraged by what may be a
decoupling  of the gold price from the  dollar.  For the past few years the gold
price has moved  inversely to the dollar,  strengthening  as the dollar weakened
and vice versa.  Recently,  the gold price broke out to new  five-year  highs in
euros,  the  Japanese  yen, the Swiss franc and the British  pound.  If gold can
maintain  these highs,  it should attract a far wider audience than was the case
when most of the rise in gold price reflected the weaker dollar.

     Further  impacting  our  South  African  dividends  was a 13% fall in South
African  gold  production  during the first  quarter of 2005.  During 2004 South
African gold  production  was at 342.7 tons,  its lowest  level since 1931.  The
South African  Chamber of Mines  recently  commented that the gold mining sector
has remained under  pressure due to falling rand revenues and rising  production
costs  during the first  quarter of this year.  The Chamber went on to note that
cost  pressures over the last three years have included an 18% increase in water
prices in each of the last three years.  Steel prices,  which comprise about 10%
of the cash  production  costs of large scale gold  mines,  have risen by double
digit  rates  in each  year.  Labor  costs  which  represent  about  50% of cash
production  costs have  increased by far more than the  inflation  rate over the
past two years.  Rail tariffs have also risen sharply.  Altogether,  the average
increase in total production costs excluding  capital expenditures rose by 13.4%
in 2004 or 3 times the rate of the consumer price index.

                                                                               1

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                          SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2005
                                   (UNAUDITED)

1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company")
is a closed-end management investment company registered under the United States
Investment  Company  Act of  1940,  and was  organized  as an  exempted  limited
liability  company  under the laws of Bermuda on April 29, 2003. On November 19,
2004,  the Company,  pursuant to an Agreement  and Plan of  Reorganization  (the
"Reorganization"),  acquired all the assets and assumed all the  liabilities  of
ASA Limited  ("ASA"),  a South African public  limited  liability  company.  The
financial  statements and financial highlights through November 19, 2004 reflect
the  financial  information  of ASA. The following is a summary of the Company's
significant accounting policies:

A. INVESTMENTS

Portfolio  securities  are generally  valued at the last reported sales price on
the last  trading  day of the  period,  or the mean  between the closing bid and
asked prices of those  securities  not traded on that date.  In the event that a
mean price  cannot be  computed  due to the  absence of either a bid or an asked
price, then the bid price plus 1% or the asked price less 1%, as applicable,  is
used.  Securities for which current market  quotations are not readily available
are valued at their fair value as  determined in good faith by, or in accordance
with procedures adopted by, the Company's Board of Directors.

The  difference  between cost and current  value is reflected  separately as net
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.  The net realized gain or
loss from the sale of securities is determined  for  accounting  purposes on the
identified cost basis.

There is no assurance that the valuation at which the Company's  investments are
carried could be realized upon sale.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio  securities  and other assets and  liabilities  denominated in foreign
currencies  are  translated  into U.S.  dollar  amounts at the  closing  rate of
exchange on the date of valuation.  Purchases and sales of investment securities
and income and expense items  denominated  in foreign  currencies are translated
into U.S.  dollar  amounts on the  respective  dates of such  transactions.  The
resulting  net foreign  currency  gain or loss is included in the  statement  of
operations.

C. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

During  the six  months  ended May 31,  2005  sales of  securities  amounted  to
$5,993,452  and  there  were no  purchases  of  securities.

Dividend  income  is  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date  (date  on  which  the
securities would be sold ex-dividend) net of withholding taxes, if any. Interest
income is recognized on the accrual basis.

D. DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

The reporting for financial  statement purposes of distributions made during the
fiscal year from net  investment  income or net  realized  gains may differ from
their  ultimate  reporting for United States  federal  income tax purposes.  The
differences  are  caused  primarily  by the  separate  line item  reporting  for
financial  statement  purposes of foreign exchange gains or losses. See pages 10
through 12 for additional tax information for United States shareholders.

E. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported amounts of
revenues  and expenses for the period.  Actual  results  could differ from those
estimates.

                                                                               7

F. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements are presented in United States dollars.

Certain prior year amounts in the  accompanying  financial  statements have been
reclassified  to conform  with current  year  presentation.

2   TAX STATUS OF THE COMPANY   The Company is not subject to tax as an exempted
liability company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda.

3   RETIREMENT PLANS   In 1994, ASA entered  into a  supplemental  non-qualified
pension  agreement  with its  Chairman.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  ASA
agreed to credit $25,000 per year for five years, beginning December 1, 1993, to
a Supplemental Pension Account with interest credited at an annual rate of 3.5%.

   The Board of Directors  approved increases in the amount of the annual credit
as  follows:  $28,125 in May 1999;  $31,250 in February  2002,  $45,000 in March
2003,  $55,000 in  February  2004 and $60,000 in March  2005.  As a result,  the
Company has recorded an expense amount of $28,332 for the six month period ended
May 31, 2005.

   The  Company has  recorded an asset in the amount of $160,000  related to the
retirement  obligation  liability of $423,967 as of May 31,  2005.  The $423,967
represents the total liability payable under the agreement at May 31, 2005. Upon
retirement from the Company, the liability under the agreement is payable in ten
(10) consecutive equal annual payments to the Chairman.

4   CONCENTRATION RISK   Under normal circumstances,  over 50% of the  Company's
assets will be invested in equity  securities  of companies  conducting,  as the
major  portion of their  business,  gold mining and related  activities in South
Africa.  The Company also invests in  securities  of companies  engaged in other
businesses in South Africa,  including the mining of other precious  metals.  In
addition, the Company invests a portion of its assets in securities of companies
operating  outside  of  South  Africa  in  extractive  and  related  activities,
including gold mining.  The Company is, therefore,  subject to gold and precious
metal  related  risks as well as risks  related  to  investing  in South  Africa
including  political,  economic,  regulatory,  currency  fluctuation and foreign
exchange risks. As a result of industry consolidation,  the Company currently is
invested in a limited  number of  securities  and thus holds large  positions in
certain  securities.  Because the Company's  investments  are  concentrated in a
limited  number of  securities  of companies  involved in the mining of gold and
other precious metals and related activities, the net asset value of the Company
may be subject to greater  volatility  than that of a more  broadly  diversified
investment company.

5   INDEMNIFICATIONS   In the ordinary  course  of business,  the Company enters
into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Company's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Company has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification  provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of
Directors of ASA (Bermuda) Limited:

     We have reviewed the  accompanying  statement of assets and  liabilities of
ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited,  including the schedule of  investments,  as of May 31,
2005,  and the  related  statements  of  operations,  surplus and changes in net
assets,  supplementary  information  and financial  highlights for the six-month
period ended May 31, 2005. These financial statements,  financial highlights and
supplementary information are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We  conducted  our review in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public
Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States).  A  review  of  interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and
making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board,  the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion  regarding the financial  statements  taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the interim financial statements referred to above for them to
be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, the statements of surplus and changes in net
assets for the year ended November 30, 2004 and financial highlights for each of
the three years in the period ended  November 30, 2004 and in our report,  dated
December  30,  2004,  we expressed  an  unqualified  opinion on those  financial
statements  and financial  highlights.  The financial  highlights  for the years
presented  prior to November  30, 2002 were  audited by other  auditors who have
ceased  operations  and whose  report  dated  December  18,  2001  expressed  an
unqualifed opinion on those financial highlights.

CERTAIN TAX INFORMATION FOR
UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)

From  December 1, 1963 through  November 30, 1987,  the Company was treated as a
"foreign  investment  company"  for United  States  federal  income tax purposes
pursuant to Section 1246 of the Internal  Revenue Code.  Under that  section,  a
United States  shareholder  who has held his shares in the Company for more than
one year is subject to tax at  ordinary  income tax rates on his profit (if any)
on a sale of his shares to the extent of his  "ratable  share" of the  Company's
earnings  and  profits  accumulated  for the period  during  which he held those
shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987.  If such  shareholder's
profit on the sale of his  shares  exceeds  such  ratable  share and he held his
shares for more than one year,  then,  subject to the discussion below regarding
the United States  federal  income tax rules  applicable to taxable years of the
Company  beginning  after  November 30, 1987,  he is subject to tax at long-term
capital gain rates on the excess.

   The Company's per share earnings and profits  accumulated  (undistributed) in
each of the taxable years from 1964 through 1987 is given below in United States
currency.  All the per share amounts give effect to the two-for-one stock splits
that became effective on May 10, 1966, May 10, 1973 and May 9, 1975. All the per
share amounts reflect distributions through November 30, 2004.

   Under  rules  enacted  by the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  the  Company  became a
"passive foreign investment company" (a "PFIC") on December 1, 1987*. The manner
in which these rules apply  depends on whether a United States  shareholder  (1)
elects to treat the Company as a qualified electing fund ("QEF") with respect to
his Company  shares,  (2) for taxable  years of such United  States  shareholder
beginning after December 31, 1997, elects to "mark-to-market" his Company shares
as of the close of each taxable year, or (3) makes neither election.

   In general,  if a United  States  shareholder  of the  Company  does NOT make
either such election, any gain realized on the direct or indirect disposition of
his  Company  shares  will be treated as  ordinary  income.  In  addition,  such
shareholder will be subject to an "interest charge" on part of his tax liability
with  respect  to  such  gain,  as  well  as with  respect  to  certain  "excess
distributions" made by the Company. Furthermore, shares held by such shareholder
may be denied the benefit of any oth erwise applicable  increase in tax basis at
death.  Under  proposed  regulations,  a  "disposition"  would  include  a  U.S.
taxpayer's becoming a nonresident alien.

   As noted, the general tax consequences  described in the preceding  paragraph
apply to an  "excess  distribution"  on  Company  shares,  which is defined as a
distribution  by the  Company  for a taxable  year that is more than 125% of the
average amount it distributed  for the three preceding  taxable  years.** If the
Company  makes an  excess  distribution  in a  taxable  year,  a  United  States
shareholder who has not made a QEF or mark-to-market  election would be required
to allocate the excess  amount  ratably over the ENTIRE  holding  period for his
shares.  That  allocation  would  result in tax  being  payable  at the  highest
applicable  rate in the prior years to which the  distribution  is allocated and
interest charges being imposed on the resulting  "underpayment" of taxes made in
those years.  In contrast,  a  distribution  that is not an excess  distribution
would be  taxable  to a United  States  shareholder  as a normal  dividend  (see
footnote * above), with no interest charge.

   If a United  States  shareholder  elects to treat the  Company  as a QEF with
respect to his  shares  therein  for the first  year he holds his shares  during
which the Company is a PFIC (or who later makes the QEF election and also elects
to treat his shares  generally  as if they were sold for their fair market value
on the first  day of the first  taxable  year of the  Company  for which the QEF
election  is  effective),  the  rules  described  in  the  preceding  paragraphs
generally will not apply.  Instead,  the electing United States shareholder will
include  annually  in his  gross  income  his PRO RATA  share  of the  Company's
ordinary  earnings  and net capital  gain (his "QEF"  inclusion)  regardless  of
whether  such  income  or  gain  was  actually  distributed.   A  United  States
shareholder  who makes a valid QEF election will  recognize  capital gain on any
profit from the actual  sale of his shares if those  shares were held as capital
assets,  except to the extent of the shareholder's ratable share of the earnings
and profits of the Company accumulated for the period during which he held those
shares between December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987, as described above.

   Alternatively,  if a  United  States  shareholder  makes  the  mark-to-market
election with respect to Company shares for taxable years  beginning on or after
January  1, 1998,  such  shareholder  will be  required  annually  to report any
unrealized  gain  with  respect  to his  shares  as  ordinary  income,  and  any
unrealized loss would be permitted as an

- ----------

*  Because the Company is a PFIC, dividends it pays will not qualify for the 15%
maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on dividends that  individuals  receive and
instead will be taxed at rates up to 35%.

** For example, the Company made annual distributions of $.55, $.80 and $.80 per
share  during  the  taxable  years  ended  November  30,  2004,  2003 and  2002,
respectively,  an  average  per year of  $.71667  per  share.  Accordingly,  any
distribution  in excess of $.90 per share (125% of $.71667)  would be treated as
an excess  distribution  for the taxable year ending  November  30,  2005.  (All
amounts in U.S. currency.)

                                                                              11

ordinary loss, but only to the extent of previous inclusions of ordinary income.
Any gain  subsequently  realized by the electing United States  shareholder on a
sale or other  disposition  of his  Company  shares  also  would be  treated  as
ordinary income, but such shareholder would not be subject to an interest charge
on  his  resulting  tax  liability.  Special  rules  apply  to a  United  States
shareholder  that held his PFIC stock prior to the first  taxable year for which
the mark-to-market election was effective.

   A United States  shareholder with a valid QEF election in effect would not be
taxed  on any  distributions  paid  by the  Company  to the  extent  of any  QEF
inclusions,  but any  distributions  out of accumulated  earnings and profits in
excess thereof would be treated as taxable  dividends.  Such a shareholder would
increase the tax basis in his Company shares by the amount of any QEF inclusions
and reduce  such tax basis by any  distributions  to him that are not taxable as
described  in the  preceding  sentence.  Special  rules  apply to United  States
shareholders  who make the QEF  election and wish to defer the payment of tax on
their annual QEF inclusions.

   Each  shareholder  who desires QEF  treatment  must  individually  elect such
treatment. The QEF election must be made for the taxable year of the shareholder
in which or with which the taxable  year of the Company  ends. A QEF election is
effective  for the  shareholder's  taxable  year  for  which  it is made and all
subsequent  taxable years of the  shareholder and may not be revoked without the
consent of the Internal Revenue Service.  A shareholder of the Company who first
held his Company  shares after November 30, 2004 and who files his tax return on
the basis of a calendar  year may make a QEF election on his 2005 tax return.  A
shareholder  of the  Company  who  first  held his  Company  shares on or before
November  30,  2004 may also make the QEF  election  on his 2005 tax  return but
should consult his tax advisor concerning the tax consequences and special rules
that apply when a QEF election  could have been made with respect to such shares
for an earlier taxable year.

   The QEF  election  must be made by the  due  date,  with  extensions,  of the
federal  income tax return for the  taxable  year for which the  election  is to
apply. Under Treasury regulations,  the QEF election is made on Internal Revenue
Service Form 8621, which must be completed and attached to a timely filed income
tax return in which the  shareholder  reports his QEF  inclusion for the year to
which the election applies. In order to allow United States shareholders to make
the  QEF  elections  and  to  comply  with  the  applicable   annual   reporting
requirements,  the  Company  annually  will  provide  to  them  a  "PFIC  Annual
Information  Statement"  containing  certain  information  required  by Treasury
regulations.

   In early 2006 the Company will send to United  States  shareholders  the PFIC
Annual  Information  Statement for the Company's 2005 taxable year.  Such annual
information  statement  may be used for  purposes  of  completing  Form 8621.  A
shareholder  who either is subject  to a prior QEF  election  or is making a QEF
election for the first time must attach a completed  Form 8621 to his income tax
return each year.  Other United States  shareholders  also must attach completed
Forms 8621 to their tax returns  each year,  but  shareholders  not electing QEF
treatment will not need to report QEF inclusions thereon.

   Special rules apply to United States  persons who hold Company shares through
intermediate  entities or persons and to United States shareholders who directly
or indirectly pledge their shares, including those in a margin account.

   Ordinarily, the tax basis that is obtained by a transferee of property on the
death of the owner of that  property is adjusted to the  property's  fair market
value on the date of death (or  alternate  valuation  date).  If a United States
shareholder  dies  owning  shares  with  respect  to which he did not  elect QEF
treatment  (or  elected  such  treatment  after the first year in which he owned
shares in which the  Company was a PFIC and did not elect to  recognize  gain as
described above),  the transferee of those shares will not be entitled to adjust
the tax basis in such shares to the fair  market  value on the date of death (or
alternate  valuation  date).  In that case, in general,  the  transferee of such
shares will take a basis in the shares equal to the shareholder's  basis therein
immediately before his death. If a United States shareholder dies owning Company
shares for which a valid QEF  election  was in effect for all  taxable  years in
such  shareholder's  holding  period during which the Company was a PFIC (or the
shareholder elected to treat the shares as if sold on the first day of the first
taxable year of the Company for which the QEF election was effective),  then the
basis  increase  generally  will be available  unless the holding period for his
shares began on or prior to November 30, 1987.  In the latter case,  in general,
any  otherwise  applicable  basis  increase will be reduced to the extent of the
shareholder's  ratable  share  of  the  earnings  and  profits  of  the  Company
accumulated for the period during which he held those shares between December 1,
1963 and November 30, 1987.

   DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE APPLICABLE TAX RULES, UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS
OF THE COMPANY ARE STRONGLY  URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS  CONCERNING
THE  IMPACT  OF THESE  RULES ON THEIR  INVESTMENT  IN THE  COMPANY  AND ON THEIR
INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   EquiServe  Trust  Company,  N.A.  ("EquiServe")  has been  engaged to offer a
dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") to shareholders. Shareholders must elect
to  participate  in the Plan by  signing  an  authorization.  The  authorization
appoints  EquiServe  as agent to apply to the  purchase of common  shares of the
Company  in the open  market  (i) all cash  dividends  (after  deduction  of the
service charge  described below) which become payable to such participant on the
Company's  shares  (including  shares  registered  in his or her name and shares
accumulated  under the Plan) and (ii) any voluntary  cash payments ($50 minimum,
$3,000 maximum per dividend  period)  received from such  participant  within 30
days prior to such dividend payment date.

   For  the  purpose  of  making   purchases,   EquiServe  will  commingle  each
participant's  funds with those of all other participants in the Plan. The price
per  share of  shares  purchased  for each  participant's  account  shall be the
average price (including brokerage  commissions and any other costs of purchase)
of all shares  purchased in the open market with the net funds  available from a
cash dividend and any voluntary cash payments being concurrently  invested.  Any
stock  dividends or split shares  distributed on shares held in the Plan will be
credited to the participant's account.

   For each  participant,  a service charge of 5% of the combined  amount of the
participant's dividend and any voluntary payment being concurrently invested, up
to a maximum  charge of $2.50 per  participant,  will be  deducted  (and paid to
EquiServe) prior to each purchase of shares. Shareholder sales of shares held by
EquiServe in the Plan are subject to a fee of $10.00 plus applic able  brokerage
commissions deducted from the proceeds of the sale.  Additional nominal fees are
charged by EquiServe  for  specific  shareholder  requests  such as requests for
information  regarding  share cost basis detail in excess of two prior years and
for replacement 1099 reports older than three years.

   Participation  in the Plan may be terminated by a participant  at any time by
written instructions to EquiServe. Upon termination,  a participant will receive
a  certificate  for the full number of shares  credited  to his or her  account,
unless he or she requests the sale of all or part of such shares.

   Dividends  reinvested  by a  shareholder  under  the Plan will  generally  be
treated for U.S.  federal  income tax  purposes in the same manner as  dividends
paid to such shareholder in cash. See "Certain tax information for United States
shareholders" for more information  regarding tax consequences to U.S. investors
of an investment in shares of the Company, including the effect of the Company's
status as a PFIC.  The  amount of the  service  charge  is  deductible  for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, subject to limitations.

   To  participate  in the Plan an investor  may not hold his or her shares in a
"street name" brokerage account.

   Additional  information  regarding  the Plan may be obtained  from  EquiServe
Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan, 250 Royall St., Canton, MA 02021.  Information may
also  be  obtained  by  calling   EquiServe's   Shareholder  Contact  Center  at

I, Robert J.A. Irwin, certify that:

     1.  I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of ASA (Bermuda) Limited;

     2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary

         the periods presented in this report;

     4.  I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
         and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment
         Company Act of 1940) and internal control over financial reporting (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
         the registrant and have:

         a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my
              supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to me by others within those entities, particularly during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         b)   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
              under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
              the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
              financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
              controls and procedures and presented in this report my
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         d)   Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
              control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
              fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5.  I have disclosed to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
         of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
         equivalent functions):

         a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process, summarize, and report financial information;
              and

         b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
              other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
              internal control over financial reporting.
