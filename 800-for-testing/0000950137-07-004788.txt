PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return with sales charges includes payment of the
maximum sales charge of 3.25 percent for Class A shares, an contingent deferred
sales charges of 3.00 percent for Class B shares (in year one and declining to
zero after year five), a contingent deferred sales charges of 1.00 percent for
Class C shares in year one, and combined distribution fees and service fees of
up to 0.25 percent for Class A shares and up to 1.00 percent for Class B and C
shares and a service fee of up to 0.15 percent for Class IC shares. Effective
2/18/05, contingent deferred sales charges for Class IB and Class IC shares are
waived. New investments are not available in Class IB and IC shares. Figures
shown above assume reinvestment of all distributions. The fund's adviser has
waived or reimbursed fees and expenses from time to time; absent such
waivers/reimbursements, the fund's returns would have been lower.

                                                                               1

Fund Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2007

MARKET CONDITIONS

Solid economic growth, contained inflation, and falling oil and commodity prices
created a favorable environment for senior loans during the six-month reporting
period. Overall trends in the credit markets remained positive as corporations
exhibited strong cash flows and balance sheets, increased productivity, and
improved credit quality while benefiting from a generally lower cost of capital.
In addition, corporate debt default rates remained low.

The Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") finally took a respite from its
two-year long campaign of raising interest rates during the reporting period,
electing to keep its target federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. The
ease in the Fed's monetary policy, however, had been widely anticipated by the
market and interest rates had already declined in response. As a result,
interest rates across the yield curve remained relatively stable throughout the
period. Yields on senior loans, which adjust in tandem to short-term rates, were
generally unchanged as well.

Yield spreads in the senior loan market climbed to late-2005 levels in the third
quarter of 2006, then leveled off until the last month of the period, when they
narrowed slightly. Demand for senior loans remained quite strong as the market
continues to see increasing activity from institutional investors such as hedge
funds and propriety desks, as well as from crossover investments from
traditional high-yield investors. The strong demand for senior loans was met by
robust supply. A significant increase in merger and acquisition activity,
leveraged buyouts, and second lien loans helped fuel record levels of new
issuance. At the same time, senior loan default rates receded throughout the
period, reaching a record low of just 0.78 percent.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 4.57 percent for the six months ended January 31, 2007 (Class
A shares, unadjusted for sales charges).

The performance for the five share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results. See Performance Summary for standardized performance information.

We continued to follow our research-intensive investment process focused on
identifying companies with strong management, solid and predictable cash flow,
and sufficient collateral in the event of default. We employ a bottom-up asset
selection process driven by analysis of individual company fundamentals. We also
analyze overall sector and industry trends, which led us to favor loans in
sectors that are typically less cyclical in nature, such as food and drug,
cable, and leisure and entertainment. These sectors continued to be represented
in the fund's top holdings. We also favored less cyclical names in the paper and
packaging sector that have experienced steady demand. Throughout the reporting
period, however, the portfolio was invested across a broad range of industries.

We generally avoid investing in companies that we perceive to be vulnerable to
cyclical economic downturns. As such, we remain cautious regarding the auto and
airline industries due to their susceptibility to high fuel prices. In addition,
we have been very selective regarding the health care industry and have
gradually reduced the portfolio's holdings in this sector due to the uncertain
regulatory environment.

The fund benefited during the period from our use of leverage. Leverage involves
borrowing at a floating short-term rate and reinvesting the proceeds at a higher
rate. We used this strategy on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance the
fund's dividend. Unlike other fixed-income asset classes, using leverage in
conjunction with senior loans does not involve the same degree of risk from
rising short-term interest rates since the income from senior loans adjusts to
changes in interest rates, as do the rates which determine the trust's borrowing
costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall, borrowing costs would also
decline.) We might reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality
conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of the fund's net asset value.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the fund in
the future.

                                                                               3

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS

       Each Van Kampen fund provides a complete schedule of portfolio holdings
       in its semiannual and annual reports within 60 days of the end of the
       fund's second and fourth fiscal quarters by filing the schedule
       electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
       semiannual reports are filed on Form N-CSRS and the annual reports are
       filed on Form N-CSR. Van Kampen also delivers the semiannual and annual
       reports to fund shareholders, and makes these reports available on its
       public Web site, www.vankampen.com. In addition to the semiannual and
       annual reports that Van Kampen delivers to shareholders and makes
       available through the Van Kampen public Web site, each fund files a
       complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the fund's first
       and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q. Van Kampen does not deliver the
       reports for the first and third fiscal quarters to shareholders, nor are
       the reports posted to the Van Kampen public Web site. You may, however,
       obtain the Form N-Q filings (as well as the Form N-CSR and N-CSRS
       filings) by accessing the SEC's Web site, http://www.sec.gov. You may
       also review and copy them at the SEC's Public Reference Room in
       Washington, DC. Information on the operation of the SEC's Public
       Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330. You
       can also request copies of these materials, upon payment of a duplicating
       fee, by electronic request at the SEC's e-mail address
       (publicinfo@sec.gov) or by writing the Public Reference section of the
       SEC, Washington, DC 20549-0102.

HOUSEHOLDING NOTICE

       To reduce fund expenses, the fund attempts to eliminate duplicate
       mailings to the same address. The fund delivers a single copy of certain
       shareholder documents to investors who share an address, even if the
       accounts are registered under different names. The fund's prospectuses
       and shareholder reports (including annual privacy notices) will be
       delivered to you in this manner indefinitely unless you instruct us
       otherwise. You can request multiple copies of these documents by either
       calling (800) 341-2911 or writing to Van Kampen Investor Services at 1
       Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181. Once Investor
       Services has received your instructions, we will begin sending individual
       copies for each account within 30 days.

PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES AND PROXY VOTING RECORD

       You may obtain a copy of the fund's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures
       without charge, upon request, by calling toll free (800) 847-2424 or by
       visiting our Web site at www.vankampen.com. It is also available on the
       Securities and Exchange Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

       You may obtain information regarding how the fund voted proxies relating
       to portfolio securities during the most recent twelve-month period ended
       June 30 without charge by visiting our Web site at www.vankampen.com.
       This information is also available on the Securities and Exchange
       Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

                                                                               7

Expense Example

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments of Class A Shares
and contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions of Class B and Class C
Shares; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and
service (12b-1) fees; and other Fund expenses. This example is intended to help
you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period 8/1/06 - 1/31/07.

ACTUAL EXPENSE

The first line of the table below provides information about actual account
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES

The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense
ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not
the Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for
the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing cost of
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports
of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales
charges (loads) or contingent deferred sales charges. Therefore, the second line
of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you
determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if
these transactional costs were included, your cost would have been higher.

</Table>

*   Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio of 2.60%, 3.35%,
    3.35%, 2.59% and 2.59% for Class A, B, C, IB and IC Shares, respectively,
    multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied by
    184/365 (to reflect the one-half year period). These expense ratios reflect
    an expense waiver.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

(a) All or a portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    loan commitments.

(b) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(c) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(d) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(e) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(f) Payment-in-kind security

(g) Affiliated company

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2007.

(i) 144A-Private Placement security which is exempt from registration under Rule
    144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(j) Non-income producing security as the stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(k) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.30%
    of the net assets of the Fund.

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. Bank
    loan ratings are unaudited.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

(a) Based on average shares outstanding.

(b) Assumes reinvestment of all distributions for the period and does not
    include payment of the maximum sales charge of 3.25% or early withdrawal
    charge. On purchases of $1 million or more, an early withdrawal charge of 1%
    may be imposed on certain repurchases by the Fund made within eighteen
    months of purchase. If the sales charges were included, total returns would
    be lower. These returns include combined distribution and services fees of
    up to .25% and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
    would pay on Fund distributions or the repurchases by the Fund of Fund
    shares.

(c) Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
    variable rate senior loan interests.

(d) Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
    Borrowings) from the Fund's total assets and dividing by the total number of
    senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
    indebtedness.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. The Fund continuously offers Class A
Shares, Class B Shares and Class C Shares. Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares
are not continuously offered. Each class of shares differs by its initial sales
load, contingent deferred sales charges, the allocation of class-specific
expenses and voting rights on matters affecting a single class.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Fund
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Fund's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and notes
for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of
such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available,
Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent market
indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing sources
approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the
Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until the next interest rate
redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loans. Consideration of
comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of
deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have adjustment periods
comparable to the Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior
Loans are reviewed and approved by the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of
Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees. Credit default swaps are valued using market
quotations from brokers.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Fund acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified

                                                                              41

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

price. Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt
security. The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical
delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian
bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at
not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses. The Fund
may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery" basis
with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so purchased
is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Fund will segregate
assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount
of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until after payment
is made. At January 31, 2007, the Fund had no when-issued or delayed delivery
purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for
distribution and service fees, which are unique to each class of shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2006, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $1,049,335,119, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

    The Repurchase Offers will continue to be for between 5% and 25% of the

quarterly offers was up to 15% during any one quarter, the Fund's present intent

shares subject to repurchase in any 3-month period will not exceed 25%). The
repurchase request deadline will be the third Friday of each calendar month (or
the preceding business day if such third Friday is not a business day). To
accommodate monthly Repurchase Offers, the Fund has shorter notice periods
before each offer, shorter repurchase periods and shorter payment periods after
each offer. During the six months ended January 31, 2007, the Fund made one
quarterly Repurchase Offer and three monthly Repurchase Offers as follows:
During the Repurchase Offer period ended October 20, 2006 (the Request
Deadline), the Fund offered to repurchase up to 5% of the aggregate of its
outstanding shares and the total amount tendered in such Repurchase Offer

and the total amount tendered in such Repurchase Offer amounted to 3,418,350
shares or 1.7% of the Fund's outstanding shares. During the Repurchase Offer
period ended December 15, 2006 (the Request Deadline), the Fund offered to
repurchase up to 5% of the aggregate of its outstanding shares and the total
amount tendered in such Repurchase Offer amounted to 2,644,408 shares or 1.3% of
the Fund's outstanding shares. During the Repurchase Offer period ended January
19, 2007 (the Request Deadline), the Fund offered to repurchase up to 5% of the
aggregate of its outstanding shares and the total amount tendered in such
Repurchase Offer amounted to 3,288,566 shares or 1.7% of the Fund's outstanding
shares.

6. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Fund had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $79,482,811 as of January 31, 2007.
The Fund intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating
cash, liquid securities, and liquid senior loans as a reserve. The unrealized

7. BORROWINGS

The Fund entered into a revolving credit and security agreement dated November

agreement was used for temporary liquidity purposes and funding of shareholder
repurchases.

    On June 23, 2006, the shareholders of the Fund approved an amendment to the
Fund's fundamental policy regarding the Fund's use of financial leverage to
allow the Fund to use leverage to the maximum extent allowable under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As of July 14, 2006, the Fund
entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement

$386,902,174 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.35%.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At January 31, 2007, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation
basis.

9. DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN

Shares of the Fund are distributed by Van Kampen Funds, Inc. ("the
Distributor"), an affiliate of the Adviser. The Fund has adopted a distribution
plan (the "Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class
B Shares and Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, as amended, as if the Fund were an open-end investment
company. The Fund also has adopted a service plan (the "Service Plan") with
respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class
IC Shares. There is no Distribution Plan or Service Plan for the Class IB Shares
and no Distribution Plan for the Class IC Shares. All service fees under the
Service Plan applicable to Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and
Class IC Shares are currently being waived. For the six months ended January 31,
2007, the Distributor waived service fees of $549,686. This waiver is voluntary
in nature and can be discontinued at any time. Under the Distribution Plan and
Service Plan, the Fund pays distribution fees in connection with the sale and
distribution of its Shares and service fees in connection with the provision of
ongoing services to shareholders of each such class and the maintenance of
shareholder accounts.

    Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund may spend up to a
total of 0.25%, 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.15% (0.25% maximum) per year of the average
daily net assets of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC
Shares, respectively. Due to voluntary fee waivers by the Distributor, the
aggregate distribution and service fees are currently 0.00%, 0.75%, 0.75%, and
0.00% per year of the average daily net assets for Class A

Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC Shares, respectively.
Annual fees under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan are accrued daily. The
net annual fees for Class B and Class C Shares are paid monthly to the
Distributor. The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and
not yet reimbursed ("unreimbursed receivable") was approximately $327,100 and
$647,200 for Class B and Class C Shares, respectively. These amounts may be
recovered from future payments under the distribution plan. To the extent the
unreimbursed receivable has been fully recovered, any excess fees will be
refunded to the Fund on a quarterly basis.

10. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

11. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position
must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is
effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance
allows implementing FIN 48 in the fund NAV calculations as late as the fund's
last NAV calculation in the first required financial statement period. As a
result, the Fund will incorporate FIN 48 in its semi annual report on January
31, 2008. The impact to the Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently
being assessed.

    In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

12. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Fund may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as to
attempt to protect the Fund against possible changes in the market value of its
portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Fund's portfolio holdings,
including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with the change
in value reflected in unrealized appreciation/depreciation.

    The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes
or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit risk of
an issuer. A buyer of a credit default swap is said to buy protection by paying
periodic fees in return for a contingent payment from the seller if the issuer
has a credit event such as bankruptcy, a failure to pay

                                                                              49
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

outstanding obligations or deteriorating credit while the swap is outstanding. A
seller of a credit default swap is said to sell protection and thus collects the
periodic fees and profits if the credit of the issuer remains stable or improves
while the swap is outstanding but the seller in a credit default swap contract
would be required to pay an agreed-upon amount, which approximates the notional
amount of the swap as disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of
Investments, to the buyer in the event of an adverse credit event of the issuer.
The Fund accrues for the periodic fees on swap contracts on a daily basis with
the net amount accrued recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of
swap contracts. Upon cash settlement of the periodic fees, the net amount is
recorded as realized gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statements of
Operations. Net unrealized gains are recorded as an asset or net unrealized
losses are reported as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
The change in value of the swap contracts is reported as unrealized gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.

    Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested
in the issuer directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general market risk,
counterparty risk and credit risk. If there is a default by the counterparty,
the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to
the transaction.
