1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company") is a closed-end, diversified investment
     company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     Prior to becoming a regulated investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
     Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary of
     significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation
     of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles for investment companies.

      A.    Investment Valuations - The investment securities are stated at
            market value as determined by closing prices on national securities
            exchanges. Investment securities include corporate bonds, mutual
            funds, and common and preferred stocks.

            The investments in limited partnerships, other investments and
            venture capital are stated at estimated fair value as determined by
            the management of these investments and are approved by the
            Company's Valuation Committee after giving consideration to
            historical and projected financial results, economic conditions,
            financial condition of investee and other factors and events subject
            to change. Because of the inherent uncertainty of those valuations,
            the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that
            would have been used had a ready market value for the securities
            existed, and these differences could be material.

            The carrying value of the investments in wholly owned subsidiaries
            is based on an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the
            subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of the wholly owned subsidiaries in
            the statement of operations represents the current year earnings of
            the subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method.

            The carrying value of the investment in real estate is based on an
            independent appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate.

      B.    Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for
            on the date the order to buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
            losses on investments are determined on the basis of specific
            identification of issues sold or matured.

      C.    Income Taxes - No federal tax provision is required as it is the
            Company's policy to comply with the provisions of Subchapter M of
            the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the
            distribution to its shareholders of substantially all of its income
            and any capital gains not offset by capital losses. Also, no state
            income tax provision has been provided because the states in which
            the Company has income recognize the tax exempt status of a
            regulated investment company.

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

      D.    Dividend Policy - It is the Company's policy to pay dividends during
            the year in sufficient amounts to meet the requirements to maintain
            its status as a regulated investment company.

      E.    Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of financial
            reporting, the Company considers all investments at financial
            institutions with original maturities of three months or less to be
            equivalent to cash. Short-term money market investments managed by
            third party investors are included in investment securities.

      F.    Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States of America requires management to make estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
            liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
            revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
            could differ from those estimates.

2.    LINE OF CREDIT

      On September 25, 2000 (modified on October 20, 2000 and renewed October
      14, 2003), the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for an
      unsecured line of credit in the amount of $10,000,000 to provide the
      Company more flexibility in its payment of dividends and management of its
      investments. The interest rate on any borrowings will be at the LIBOR
      market index rate plus 125 basis points. No commitment fee is charged on
      any unused balance. As of April 30, 2004, the Company had borrowings of
      $10,000,000 from this line of credit, which expires on July 31, 2004.

3.    ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS

      The Company does not have an advisory board. The independent directors are
      paid an annual fee of $3,000 plus $1,000 for each meeting attended in
      person or $500 for each meeting attended by telephone. Each such
      independent director is paid an additional $1,000 for each day attending a
      committee meeting in person or $500 by telephone other than on the date of
      a board meeting. In addition, all directors are reimbursed for their
      reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings.
