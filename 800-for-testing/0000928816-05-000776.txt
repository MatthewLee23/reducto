Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Throughout the period ended April 30, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board's
series of gradual increases in the federal funds rate occupied much of
investors' attention. However, these increases did not begin to have a
significant impact on stock and bond prices until the early months of
the 2005 calendar year. The Fed's more restrictive monetary policy,
along with stubbornly high energy prices, has caused concern about the
sustainability of corporate profits and slowed the stock market's
momentum. Shorter-term bond prices have also been under pressure due to
worries regarding inflation. In addition, credit quality issues have
become a greater concern, particularly in early May, after the end of
the reporting period, when rating agencies downgraded bonds issued by
Ford and General Motors. Given the uncertainties of this environment,
security selection takes on even greater importance and the in-depth,
professional research and active management that mutual funds can
provide makes them an even more intelligent choice for today's
investors.

We want you to know that Putnam Investments' management team, under the
leadership of Chief Executive Officer Ed Haldeman, continues to focus on
investment performance and remains committed to putting the interests of
shareholders first. In keeping with these goals, we are including
additional disclosure about your fund's management team in this report.
Following the Outlook for Your Fund, we provide manager compensation
information that pertains to your fund. Furthermore, in this report we
provide information about the 2004 approval by the Trustees of your
fund's management contract with Putnam. See page 13 for details.

In the following pages, members of your fund's management team discuss
the fund's performance, the strategies used to pursue the fund's
investment objectives during the reporting period, and the team's plan
for responding to recent changes in the market climate.

As always, we thank you for your continuing confidence in Putnam.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

   performance,  comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

Improving credit fundamentals across the  municipal bond universe helped
lower-quality municipal bonds outperform their higher-quality
counterparts during Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust's 2005 fiscal
year. This contributed to your fund's outperformance of its benchmark,
the Lehman Municipal Bond Index, based on results at NAV. The fund's
exposure to bonds rated BBB and below, particularly in the tobacco,
hospital, and utility sectors, was a key factor, since the benchmark
consists solely of investment-grade municipal bonds. Your fund's use of
leverage was also a primary factor in its outperformance of its
non-leveraged benchmark. The fund's performance was in line with the
Lipper peer group. It is important to note that a fund's performance at
market price may differ from its results at NAV. Although market price
performance generally reflects investment results, it may also be
influenced by several other factors, including changes in investor
perceptions of the fund or its investment advisor, market conditions,
fluctuations in supply and demand for the fund's shares, and changes in
fund distributions.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust is a leveraged fund that seeks to
provide as high a level of current income free from federal income tax
as Putnam Management believes to be consistent with the preservation of
capital. The fund invests in investment-grade and some
below-investment-grade municipal bonds. The fund may be appropriate for
investors seeking tax-free income and who are willing to accept a
moderate degree of risk, including risk associated with the use of
leverage.


Market overview

Early in the fiscal year, signs of solid economic growth and rising
corporate profits heightened investor concerns about potential
interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed). This
concern helped drive bond yields sharply higher and bond prices, which
move in the opposite direction of yields, lower. After the Fed announced
the first of what would be seven 0.25% increases in the federal funds
rate during the fund's fiscal year, bond market investors seemed
encouraged and, initially, rates trended downward modestly. This gradual
approach to reining in economic growth may have helped allay investor
fears of higher longer-term rates, as long-term bond yields ended the
year lower despite rising short-term rates. As shorter- and longer-term
interest rates began to converge, the yield curve flattened. The Fed
continued its tightening policy with another 0.25% increase following
period-end.

The same conditions that led to rising interest rates -- an improving
economy and rising corporate earnings -- were particularly favorable for
lower-rated bonds. Among uninsured bonds and especially bonds rated BBB
and below, yield spreads tightened, and bond prices rose. Bonds at the
lower end of the credit spectrum, including BB- and B-rated bonds,
turned in the strongest performance. Municipal bonds issued by the State
of California were generally strong performers, as the economy improved
and rating agencies upgraded the state's credit rating from BBB to A
during the year. Puerto Rico municipal bonds, which are tax-exempt in
all states and often trade in line with bonds issued by the
highest-rated and top-performing state, were also standout performers.
Based on continued favorable legal rulings, yields on tobacco settlement
bonds declined overall for the year, and their prices rose accordingly.
Airline-related industrial development bonds (IDBs) staged a comeback
from distressed levels and outperformed over the trailing one-year
period. Callable bonds (which can be redeemed by their issuers before
maturity) outperformed non-callable bonds.

Strategy overview

Given our expectation for rising interest rates, your portfolio's
duration was relatively short (or defensive) at the beginning of the
fund's fiscal year. We maintained a defensive duration relative to the
fund's peers during the period. One of the strategies we used to manage
duration was selling Treasury bond futures, which enabled us to achieve
our target duration without trading large volumes of securities, which
takes time and can be more expensive for the fund. Duration is a measure
of a fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Investing in bonds
with a short duration may help protect principal when interest rates are
rising, but it can reduce the fund's potential for appreciation when
rates fall. Although the Fed adjusted interest rates upward during the
period, as we had expected, rates on long-term bonds trended downward
for much of the period, limiting the fund's participation in the price
rally.

During the period, the fund changed its positioning to take advantage of
the flattening of the yield curve. Given our expectation that short-term
rates would continue to rise, we reduced the fund's positions in inverse
floating-rate securities. These securities pay additional interest
income as short rates fall and less interest income when short rates
rise. The fund benefited from its emphasis on lower-rated,
higher-yielding bonds during the period. However, we believe the
high-yield rally has nearly run its course and toward period-end we took
advantage of continued price strength on higher-yielding bonds to reduce
the fund's position in this market segment.

How fund holdings affected performance

With the more credit-sensitive sectors of the municipal bond market
performing very well, the fund's lower-rated holdings helped its
performance substantially. The supply of lower-rated bonds coming to
market is down 32% compared to the same period in 2004, and in the face
of strong demand from yield-hungry investors, prices of lower-rated
municipal bonds in the market have moved higher. Many of the fund's
investments in the health-care, tobacco, utilities, and continuing-care
retirement communities sectors have rallied as a result, including the
Indiana Development Authority U.S. Steel revenue bonds, which have also
benefited from strong demand from both the domestic market and
international economies like China.

One of the funds' health-care holdings, Oklahoma Development Financing
Authority revenue bonds for Hillcrest Healthcare, had the added benefit
of being pre-refunded last August. Pre-refunding occurs when an issuer
raises the money to pay off a specific bond in advance and invests it in
a secure investment, usually U.S. Treasury securities, that matures at
the bond's first call date. This added security is often perceived as a
credit upgrade by the market, and can boost the bond's price. This
B-rated hospital system in Tulsa, which had a history of financial
difficulties, was purchased by for-profit hospital system Ardent Health.
Following the purchase, bondholders negotiated with Ardent to have the
bonds pre-refunded. This resulted in a significant price increase that
favorably affected the portfolio's NAV.

Airline-related industrial development bonds (IDBs), a sector of the
lower-rated municipal bond market that has struggled in recent years,
turned in surprisingly modest gains when credit spreads narrowed. IDBs are
issued by municipalities but backed by the credit of the company
benefiting from the financing. Investor perceptions about the backing
company's health, or that of its industry group, affectthe prices of these
bonds more than the rating of the issuing municipality. The airline
industry has been experiencing falling ticket prices coupled with soaring
fuel costs. Our credit analysts' views on these bonds was unfavorable and
we had underweighted them, relative to the benchmark. However, this
decision created a small headwind for the portfolio when prices of these
bonds rose during the period. In our opinion, the risks remain high, and
we would need to see the fundamentals improve considerably before
investing more heavily in this sector. The fund retains positions in
British Airways and American Airlines -- two carriers that we believe will
survive the industry's consolidation.

As a percentage of market value as of 4/30/05. A bond rated Baa or
higher is considered investment grade. The chart reflects Moody's
ratings; percentages may include bonds not rated by Moody's but
considered by Putnam Management to be of comparable quality. Ratings
will vary over time.

At the other end of the credit spectrum, many of the fund's AAA-rated
long-maturity holdings performed well, because the municipal bond yield
curve flattened during the year as long-term rates fell. Many of these
holdings are callable bonds, which we think can be expected to
outperform non-callable bonds in a rising-rate environment. Since buying
long-maturity callable bonds lengthens the fund's duration, which makes
it more vulnerable to the negative effects of rising interest rates, and
since we have focused on keeping the duration relatively short, we owned
less of these bonds than would have otherwise been the case.

Tobacco settlement bonds also enjoyed strong performance during the
fiscal year and the fund benefited from our decision to overweight this
sector, relative to the benchmark. An improving litigation environment
following a favorable Federal Appeals Court ruling combined with stable
cigarette sales have contributed to a favorable outlook for this sector.
Tobacco settlement bonds are secured by the income stream from tobacco
companies' settlement obligations to the states and generally offer
higher yields than bonds of comparable quality. In what has amounted to
an ongoing threat to this income stream, the Department of Justice (DOJ)
initiated a lawsuit in 1999 against the major tobacco companies seeking
billions of dollars that the DOJ claimed had been obtained fraudulently
from the sale of cigarettes. In February 2005, the United States Court
of Appeals issued a ruling that investors believe has significantly
mitigated the potential financial impact of the DOJ's lawsuit on tobacco
companies, and the price of tobacco settlement bonds rebounded. The fund
holds tobacco settlement bonds issued by the states of Wisconsin, South
Carolina, Washington, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and South
Dakota.

Please note that all holdings in this report are subject to review in
accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in the
future.

OF SPECIAL INTEREST

Fund's dividend reduced

Several older holdings matured or were called during the period,
requiring reinvestment of the assets at current lower interest rates.
The management team has not made any large allocation moves to
compensate for the yield decrease. To reflect this reduction in
earnings, the fund's dividend was reduced in September 2004 from $0.0795
to $0.0735 and in January 2005 from $0.0735 to $0.0644 per share.


The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

Economic growth has continued to be stronger than expected, despite the
Fed's efforts to slow growth and curb inflation by raising short-term
interest rates seven times in 0.25% increments over the course of the
fund's fiscal year. Long-term rates remain surprisingly low. In fact,
after rising modestly in late March and early April of 2005, long-term
rates fell again in the final weeks of the period. Based on sustained
solid economic growth and continued robust corporate earnings, we expect
the Fed to maintain its policy of increasing rates through 2005. We
believe Fed actions are likely to cause rising yields among bonds with
shorter maturities and further flattening of the yield curve as
short-term rates rise faster than long-term rates. We also expect more
Fed tightening than is currently anticipated by the market, which means
that we believe that bond yields may begin to rise more quickly as
investors come to the same conclusion. In light of that, we plan to
maintain the fund's defensive duration, and to continue to increase its
exposure to callable bonds.

We believe that the market has over-discounted the impact of mortgage
prepayments on the single-family housing sector, particularly in light
of rising interest rates, which are likely to slow prepayments. We plan
to add selectively to the fund's positions in this sector. We believe
that the dramatic outperformance of lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds
is now slowing and we plan to reduce our exposure to this portion of the
credit spectrum in favor of higher-quality issues. Despite recent
outperformance, we remain bearish on airline-related IDBs in light of
continued fundamental weaknesses in this sector such as rising fuel
prices and domestic overcapacity. Our view on tobacco settlement bonds
is positive and we are seeking to increase the fund's exposure as
opportunities arise.

We believe we are headed into a more challenging environment for bond
investing. Our task will be to continue to search for the most
attractive opportunities among tax-exempt securities, and to balance the
pursuit of current income with prudent risk management.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. Lower-rated bonds
may offer higher yields in return for more risk. Capital gains, if any,
are taxable for federal and, in most cases, state purposes. For some
investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax. Income from federally exempt funds may be subject to state
and local taxes. Mutual funds that invest in bonds are subject to
certain risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, and inflation
risk. As interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds
are more exposed to interest-rate risk than short-term bonds. Unlike
bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. The fund's shares
trade on a stock exchange at market prices, which may be lower than the
fund's net asset value. The fund uses leverage, which involves risk and
may increase the volatility of the fund's net asset value.

Performance summary

This section shows your fund's performance during its fiscal year, which
ended April 30, 2005. In accordance with regulatory requirements, we
also include performance for the most current calendar quarter-end.
Performance should always be considered in light of a fund's investment
strategy. Data represents past performance. Past performance does not
guarantee future results. More recent returns may be less or more than
those shown. Investment return, net asset value, and market price will
fluctuate and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your shares.

Trustee approval of management contract

General conclusions

The Board of Trustees of the Putnam funds oversees the management of
each fund and, as required by law, determines annually whether to
approve the continuance of each fund's management contract with Putnam
Management. In this regard the Board of Trustees, with the assistance of
its Contract Committee consisting solely of Independent Trustees,
requests and evaluates all information it deems reasonably necessary in
the circumstances. Over the course of several months beginning in March
and ending in June of 2004, the Contract Committee reviewed the
information provided by Putnam Management and other information
developed with the assistance of the Board's independent counsel and
independent staff. The Contract Committee reviewed and discussed key
aspects of this information with all of the Independent Trustees. Upon
completion of this review, the Contract Committee recommended and the
Independent Trustees approved the continuance of your fund's contract,
effective July 1, 2004.

This approval was based on the following conclusions:

* That the fee schedule currently in effect for your fund represents
  reasonable compensation in light of the nature and quality of the
  services being provided to the fund, the fees paid by competitive funds
  and the costs incurred by Putnam Management in providing such service,
  and

* That such fee schedule represents an appropriate sharing between fund
  shareholders and Putnam Management of such economies of scale as may
  exist in the management of the fund at current asset levels.

These conclusions were based on a comprehensive consideration of all
information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any
single factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the
Trustees' deliberations are described below.

Model fee schedules and categories; total expenses

The Trustees, working in cooperation with Putnam Management, have
developed and implemented a series of model fee schedules for the Putnam
funds designed to ensure that each fund's management fee is consistent
with the fees for similar funds in the Putnam complex and compares
favorably with fees paid by competitive funds sponsored by other advisors.
The Trustees reviewed the model fee schedule currently in effect for the
fund, including fee levels and breakpoints, and the assignment of the fund
to a particular fee category under this structure. The Trustees also
reviewed comparative fee and expense information for competitive funds.
The Trustees concluded that no changes should be made in the fund's
current fee schedule at this time. The Trustees noted that expense ratios
for a number of Putnam funds had been increasing recently as a result of
declining net assets and the natural operation of fee breakpoints. They
noted that such expense ratio increases were currently being controlled by
expense limitations implemented in January 2004. They also noted that the
competitive landscape regarding mutual fund fees may be changing as a
result of fee reductions accepted by various other fund groups in
connection with recent regulatory settlements and greater focus on fees
and expenses in the mutual fund industry generally. The Trustees indicated
an intention to monitor these developments closely.

Economies of scale

As noted above, the Trustees concluded that the fee schedule currently
in effect for your fund represents an appropriate sharing of economies
of scale at current asset levels. The Trustees indicated their intention
to continue their ongoing consideration of economies of scale and in
particular to consider further the possible operation of such economies
in the event that a significant recovery in the equity markets or net
fund sales were to raise asset levels substantially above current
levels. In this regard, the Trustees noted that they had reviewed data
relating to the substantial increase in asset levels of the Putnam funds
that occurred during the years leading up to the market peak in 2000,
the subsequent decline in assets and the resulting impact on revenues
and expenses of Putnam Management. The Trustees also noted that recent
declines in net assets in many Putnam funds, together with significant
changes in the cost structure of Putnam Management have altered the
economics of Putnam Management's business in significant ways. The
Trustees concluded that they would monitor these changes carefully and
evaluate the resulting impact on Putnam Management's economics and the
sharing of economies of scale between the parties.

Investment performance

The quality of the investment process provided by Putnam Management
represented a major factor in the Trustees' evaluation of the quality of
services provided by Putnam Management under the Management Contracts.
The Trustees recognized that a high quality investment process -- as
measured by the experience and skills of the individuals assigned to the
management of fund portfolios, the resources made available to such
personnel, and in general the ability of Putnam Management to attract
and retain high-quality personnel -- does not guarantee favorable
investment results for every fund in every time period. The Trustees
considered the investment performance of each fund over multiple time
periods and considered information comparing the fund's performance with
various benchmarks and with the performance of competitive funds. The
Trustees noted the satisfactory investment performance of many Putnam
funds.

They also noted the disappointing investment performance of certain
funds in recent years and continued to discuss with senior management of
Putnam Management the factors contributing to such under-performance and
actions being taken to improve performance. The Trustees recognized
that, in recent years, Putnam Management has made significant changes in
its investment personnel and processes and in the fund product line in
an effort to address areas of underperformance. The Trustees indicated
their intention to continue to monitor performance trends to assess the
effectiveness of these changes and to evaluate whether additional
remedial changes are warranted. As a general matter, the Trustees
concluded that consultation between the Trustees and Putnam Management
represents the most effective way to address investment performance
problems. The Trustees believe that investors in the Putnam funds and
their financial advisors have, as a general matter, effectively placed
their trust in the Putnam organization, under the supervision of the
funds' Trustees, to make appropriate decisions regarding the management
of the funds. The Trustees believe that the termination of the
Management Contract and engagement of a new investment adviser for
under-performing funds, with all the attendant disruptions, would not
serve the interests of fund shareholders at this time and would not
necessarily provide any greater assurance of improved investment
performance.

Brokerage and soft-dollar allocations; other benefits

The Trustees considered various potential benefits that Putnam
Management may receive in connection with the services it provides under
the Management Contract with your fund. These include principally
benefits related to brokerage and soft-dollar allocations, which pertain
mainly to funds investing in equity securities. The Trustees believe
that soft-dollar credits and other potential benefits associated with
the allocation of fund brokerage represent assets of the funds that
should be used for the benefit of fund shareholders. The Trustees noted
recent trends in the allocation of fund brokerage, including commission
costs, the allocation of brokerage to firms that provide research
services to Putnam Management, and the sources and application of
available soft-dollar credits. Effective December 31, 2003, reflecting a
decision made by the Trustees earlier that year, Putnam Management
ceased allocating brokerage in connection with the sale of fund shares.
In addition, in preparing its budget for commission allocations in 2004,
Putnam Management voluntarily reduced substantially the allocation of
brokerage commissions to acquire research services from third-party
service providers. In light of evolving best practices in the mutual
fund industry, the Trustees concluded that this practice should be
further curtailed and possibly eliminated in the near future. The
Trustees indicated that they would continue to monitor the allocation of
the funds' brokerage to ensure that the principle of "best price and
execution" remains paramount in the portfolio trading process.


Comparison of retail and institutional fee schedules

The information examined by the Trustees as part of the annual contract
reviews included information regarding fees charged by Putnam Management
and its affiliates to institutional clients such as defined benefit
pension plans and college endowments. This information included
comparison of such fees with fees charged to the Putnam funds, as well
as a detailed assessment of the differences in the services provided to
these two types of clients. The Trustees devoted special attention to
these issues and reviewed recent articles by critics of mutual fund
fees, articles by the ICI defending such fee differences, and relevant
guidance provided by decisions of the courts. The Trustees observed, in
this regard, that the differences in fee rates between institutional
clients and mutual funds are by no means uniform when examined by
individual asset sectors, suggesting that differences in the pricing of
investment management services to these types of clients reflects to a
substantial degree historical competitive forces operating in separate
market places. In reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered
the fact that fee rates across all asset sectors are higher on average
for mutual funds than for institutional clients, and also considered the
differences between the services that Putnam provides to the Putnam
funds and those that it provides to institutional clients of the firm.

Settlement of regulatory charges related to market timing

Finally, in reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered all
matters pertinent to the administrative charges filed against Putnam
Management by the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in October
2003 relating to market timing, the firm's settlement of those charges,
and the conclusions and recommendations of the Trustees' Audit and
Pricing Committee based on its review of these matters. The Trustees
considered the actions taken by the owner of Putnam Management and its
new senior management to terminate or discipline the individuals
involved, to implement new compliance systems, to indemnify the funds
against all costs and liabilities related to these matters, and
otherwise to ensure that the interests of the funds and their
shareholders are fully protected. The Trustees noted that, in addition
to the settlements of the regulatory charges which will provide
comprehensive restitution for any losses suffered by shareholders, the
new senior management of Putnam Management has moved aggressively to
control expense ratios of funds affected by market timing, to reduce
charges to new investors, to improve disclosure of fees and expenses,
and to emphasize the paramount role of investment performance in
achieving shareholders' investment goals.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Trustees and Shareholders of
Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the fund's portfolio, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Putnam
Municipal Opportunities Trust (the "fund") at April 30, 2005, and the
results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the
financial highlights for each of the periods indicated, in conformity
with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility
of the fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of investments owned at April 30, 2005 by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for opinion.

  (a) Percentages indicated are based on net asset value of $212,505,255.

(RAT) The Moody's or Standard & Poor's ratings indicated are believed to
      be the most recent ratings available at April 30, 2005 for the
      securities listed. Ratings are generally ascribed to securities at the
      time of issuance. While the agencies may from time to time revise such
      ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the ratings do not
      necessarily represent what the agencies would ascribe to these
      securities at April 30, 2005. Securities rated by Putnam are indicated
      by "/P". Ratings are not covered by the Report of Independent Registered
      Public Accounting Firm. Security ratings are defined in the Statement of
      Additional Information.

(SEG) A portion of this security was pledged and segregated with the
      custodian to cover margin requirements for futures contracts at April
      30, 2005.

      total market value of restricted securities held at

      April 30, 2005 was $848,792 or 0.4% of net assets.

      144A after the name of a security represents those exempt from
      registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. These
      securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration,
      normally to qualified institutional buyers.

      The rates shown on VRDN and Mandatory Put Bonds are the current interest
      rates at April 30, 2005.

      The dates shown on Mandatory Put Bonds are the next mandatory put dates.

      The rates shown on IFB, which are securities paying interest rates that
      vary inversely to changes in the market interest rates, are the current
      interest rates at April 30, 2005.

Notes to financial statements
April 30, 2005

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (the "fund") is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The fund's investment
objective is to seek as high a level of current income exempt from
federal income tax as Putnam Management believes is consistent with the
preservation of capital. The fund intends to achieve its objective by
investing in a portfolio of investment grade and some below
investment-grade municipal bonds selected by Putnam Investment
Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued at fair
value on the basis of valuations provided by an independent pricing
service, approved by the Trustees. Such services use information with
respect to transactions in bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market
transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between
securities in determining value. Other investments are valued at fair
value following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts
are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in
excess of the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date;
thereafter, any remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on
securities it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current
returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures
and options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the
hedged instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the
value of the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary
market for the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is
unable to perform. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the statement
of assets and liabilities. When the contract is closed, the fund records
a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. Realized gains and losses on purchased options are included in
realized gains and losses on investment securities. If a written call
option is exercised, the premium originally received is recorded as an
addition to sales proceeds. If a written put option is exercised, the
premium originally received is recorded as a reduction to the cost of
investments.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the
value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as
"variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last sale
price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for purchased
options and the last ask price for written options. Options traded
over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers. Futures
and written option contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are
listed after the fund's portfolio.

D) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") applicable
to regulated investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund
to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax
under Section 4982 of the Code, as amended. Therefore, no provision has
been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized
appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital
gains.

At April 30, 2005, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $21,523,518
available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover    Expiration
- --------------------------------
      $126,586    April 30, 2007
     2,788,662    April 30, 2008
     1,503,027    April 30, 2009
     2,243,569    April 30, 2010
     3,588,009    April 30, 2011
     8,885,378    April 30, 2012
     2,388,287    April 30, 2013

E) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded
on the ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on
remarketed preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by
the Trustees. Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares
is generally a 28-day period for Series A and a 7-day period for Series
B and Series C. The applicable dividend rate for the remarketed
preferred shares on April 30, 2005, was 2.88% for Series A, 2.55% for
Series B and 2.75% for Series C. The amount and character of income and
gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. These differences include temporary and permanent
differences of dividends payable, unrealized gains and losses on certain
futures contracts, market discount, straddle loss deferrals and
partnership income. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations. For the
year ended April 30, 2005, the fund reclassified $71,440 to increase
undistributed net investment income and $71,440 to increase accumulated
net realized losses.

The tax basis components of distributable earnings and the federal tax
cost as of period end were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation            $17,534,123
Unrealized depreciation             (2,084,343)
                                  ------------
Net unrealized appreciation         15,449,780
Undistributed tax exempt
income                               1,160,483
Undistributed ordinary income           36,183
Capital loss carryforward          (21,523,518)
Cost for federal income
tax purposes                      $317,739,328


F) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares
is determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.


Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on 0.65% of the fund's average weekly net assets attributable to
common and preferred shares outstanding.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred
shares for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to
the proceeds of the remarketed preferred shares during that period, then
the fee payable to Putnam Management for that period will be reduced by
the amount of the excess (but not more than 0.65% of the liquidation
preference of the remarketed preferred shares outstanding during the
period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the year ended April 30, 2005, the fund
paid PFTC $221,136 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the year ended April 30, 2005, the
fund's expenses were reduced by $37,479 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $710, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund, and
an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive
additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of assets
and liabilities. The Trustees have terminated the Pension Plan with
respect to any Trustee first elected after 2003.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the year ended April 30, 2005, cost of purchases and proceeds
from sales of investment securities other than short-term investments
aggregated $102,935,260 and $94,108,844, respectively. There were no
purchases or sales of U.S. government securities.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A, B and C shares are redeemable at the option of the fund on
any dividend payment date at a redemption price of $50,000, $25,000 and
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on
a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not
such dividends have been declared) and, in certain circumstances, a call
premium.

It is anticipated that dividends paid to holders of remarketed preferred
shares will be considered tax-exempt dividends under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. To the extent that the fund earns taxable income
and capital gains by the conclusion of a fiscal year, it may be required
to apportion to the holders of the remarketed preferred shares
throughout that year additional dividends as necessary to result in an
after-tax equivalent to the applicable dividend rate for the period.
Total additional dividends for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005 were
$839.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to maintain
asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed preferred
shares as of the last business day of each month in which any such shares
are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed preferred shares
and the shares' rating agencies. Should these requirements not be met, or
should dividends accrued on the remarketed preferred shares not be paid,
the fund may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain of the remarketed
preferred shares. At April 30, 2005, no such restrictions have been placed
on the fund.

Note 5
Regulatory matters and litigation

Putnam Management has entered into agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities Division settling
charges connected with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees
and, in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities
Division, by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans.
Pursuant to these settlement agreements, Putnam Management will pay a
total of $193.5 million in penalties and restitution, with $153.5
million being paid to  shareholders and the funds. The restitution
amount will be allocated to shareholders pursuant to a plan developed by
an independent consultant, with payments to shareholders currently
expected by the end of the summer.

The SEC's and Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and
related matters also serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits,
including purported class action lawsuits filed against Putnam
Management and certain related parties, including certain Putnam funds.
Putnam Management will bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in
connection with these lawsuits. Putnam Management believes that the
likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and purported class action
lawsuits will have a material adverse financial impact on the fund is
remote, and the pending actions are not likely to materially affect its
ability to provide investment management services to its clients,
including the Putnam funds.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, the fund's principal

Item 2. Code of Ethics:
- -----------------------
(a) All officers of the Fund, including its principal executive, financial and
accounting officers, are employees of Putnam Investment Management, LLC,
the Fund's investment manager.  As such they are subject to a comprehensive
Code of Ethics adopted and administered by Putnam Investments which is
designed to protect the interests of the firm and its clients.  The Fund
has adopted a Code of Ethics which incorporates the Code of Ethics of
Putnam Investments with respect to all of its officers and Trustees who are
employees of Putnam Investment Management, LLC.  For this reason, the Fund
has not adopted a separate code of ethics governing its principal
executive, financial and accounting officers.

(c) In July 2004, Putnam Investment Management, LLC, the Fund's investment
manager, Putnam Retail Management Limited Partnership, the Fund's principal
underwriter, and Putnam Investments Limited, the sub-manager for a portion
of the assets of certain funds as determined by Putnam Management from time
to time, adopted several amendments to their Code of Ethics.  Some of these
amendments were adopted as a result of Putnam Investment Management's
partial settlement order with the SEC on November 13, 2003.  Insofar as such
Code of Ethics applies to the Fund's principal executive officer, principal
financial officer and principal accounting officer, the amendments provided
for the following:  (i) a 90-day blackout period for all shares of Putnam
open-end funds (except for money market funds) purchased or sold (including
exchanges into or out of a fund) by Putnam employees and certain family
members; (ii) a one-year holding period for all access persons that operates
in the same manner as the 90-day rule; (iii) delivery by Putnam employees to
the Code of Ethics Administrator of both quarterly account statements for
all brokerage accounts (irrespective of activity in the accounts) and
account statements for any Putnam funds not held at Putnam or for any funds
sub-advised by Putnam; (iv) a prohibition of Putnam employees from making
more than 25 trades in individual securities in their personal accounts in
any given quarter; (v) the extension of the existing prohibition of access
persons from a purchase and sale or sale and purchase of an individual
security within 60 days to include trading based on tax-lot election; (vi)
the inclusion of trades in Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (ultimate parent
company of Putnam Investment Management) securities in pre-clearance and
reporting requirements; (vii) a prohibition of limit and good-until-canceled
orders as inconsistent with the requirements of daily pre-clearance; (viii)
new limits and procedures for accounts managed by outside managers and
brokers, in order for trading in such accounts to be exempt from
pre-clearance requirements; (ix) a new gift and entertainment policy that
imposes a reporting obligation on all meals and entertainment and new limits
on non-meal entertainment; (x) a number of alternatives for the reporting of
irregular activity.

In December 2004, additional amendments to the Code of Ethics were adopted.
Insofar as such Code of Ethics applies to the Fund's principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the
amendments provided for the following:  (i) implementation of minimum
monetary sanctions for violations of the Code; (ii) expansion of the
definition of "access person" under the Code to include all Putnam employees
with access to non-public information regarding Putnam-managed mutual fund
portfolio holdings; (iii) lengthening the period during which access persons
are required to complete quarterly reports; (iv) reducing the maximum number
of trades than can be made by Putnam employees in their personal accounts in
any calendar quarter from 25 trades to 10 trades; and (v) lengthening the
required holding period for securities by access persons from 60 days to 90
days.

In March 2005, additional amendments to the Code of Ethics were adopted,
that went into effect on April 1, 2005.  Insofar as such Code of Ethics
applies to the Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer, the amendments (i) prohibit Putnam
employees and their immediate family members from having any direct or
indirect personal financial interest in companies that do business with
Putnam (excluding investment holdings in public companies that are not
material to the employee), unless such interest is disclosed and approved by
the Code of Ethics Officer; (ii) prohibit Putnam employees from using Putnam
assets, letterhead or other resources in making political or campaign
contributions, solicitations or endorsements;(iii) require Putnam employees
to obtain pre-clearance of personal political or campaign contributions or
other gifts to government officials or political candidates in certain
jurisdictions and to officials or candidates with whom Putnam has or is
seeking to establish a business relationship and (iv) require Putnam
employees to obtain pre-approval from Putnam's Director of Government
Relations prior to engaging in lobbying activities.


Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert:
- -----------------------------------------

The Funds' Audit and Pricing Committee is comprised solely of Trustees
who are "independent" (as such term has been defined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in regulations implementing Section 407
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the "Regulations")).  The Trustees believe
that each of the members of the Audit and Pricing Committee also possess
a combination of knowledge and experience with respect to financial
accounting matters, as well as other attributes, that qualify them for
service on the Committee.  In addition, the Trustees have determined
that all members of the Funds' Audit and Pricing Committee meet the
financial literacy requirements of the New York Stock Exchange's rules
and that Mr. Patterson, Mr. Stephens and Mr. Worley qualify as "audit
committee financial experts" (as such term has been defined by the
Regulations) based on their review of their pertinent experience and
education. Certain other Trustees, although not on the Audit and Pricing
Committee, would also qualify as "audit committee financial experts."
The SEC has stated that the designation or identification of a person
as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this Item 3 of Form
N-CSR does not impose on such person any duties, obligations or liability
that are greater than the duties, obligations and liability imposed on
such person as a member of the Audit and Pricing Committee and the Board
of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services:
- -----------------------------------------------
The following table presents fees billed in each of the last two fiscal
years for services rendered to the fund by the fund's independent auditors:

                    Audit       Audit-Related   Tax       All Other
Fiscal year ended   Fees        Fees            Fees      Fees
- -----------------   ----------  -------------   -------   ---------
April 30, 2005      $37,859     $21,263         $4,318    $--
April 30, 2004      $32,547     $19,468         $4,035    $41

For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2005 and April 30, 2004, the fund's
independent auditors billed aggregate non-audit fees in the amounts of
$209,285 and $164,374 respectively, to the fund, Putnam Management and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Putnam
Management that provides ongoing services to the fund.

Audit Fees represents fees billed for the fund's last two fiscal years.

Audit-Related Fees represents fees billed in the fund's last two fiscal
years for services traditionally performed by the fund's auditor, including
accounting consultation for proposed transactions or concerning financial
accounting and reporting standards and other audit or attest services not
required by statute or regulation.

Tax Fees represent fees billed in the fund's last two fiscal years for tax
compliance, tax planning and tax advice services.  Tax planning and tax
advice services include assistance with tax audits, employee benefit plans
and requests for rulings or technical advice from taxing authorities.

All Other Fees Fees represent fees billed for services relating to
calculation of investment performance.

Pre-Approval Policies of the Audit and Pricing Committee.  The Audit and
Pricing Committee of the Putnam funds has determined that, as a matter of
policy, all work performed for the funds by the funds' independent auditors
will be pre-approved by the Committee and will generally not be subject to
pre-approval procedures.

Under certain circumstances, the Audit and Pricing Committee believes that
it may be appropriate for Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam
Management") and certain of its affiliates to engage the services of the
funds' independent auditors, but only after prior approval by the Committee.
 Such requests are required to be submitted in writing to the Committee and
explain, among other things, the nature of the proposed engagement, the
estimated fees, and why this work must be performed by that particular audit
firm.  The Committee will review the proposed engagement at its next
meeting.

Since May 6, 2003, all work performed by the independent auditors for the
funds, Putnam Management and any entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with Putnam Management that provides ongoing services to the
fund was pre-approved by the Committee or a member of the Committee pursuant

Proxy voting guidelines of the Putnam funds
- -------------------------------------------

The proxy voting guidelines below summarize the funds' positions on
various issues of concern to investors, and give a general
indication of how fund portfolio securities will be voted on
proposals dealing with particular issues.  The funds' proxy voting
service is instructed to vote all proxies relating to fund portfolio
securities in accordance with these guidelines, except as otherwise
instructed by the Proxy Coordinator, a member of the Office of the
Trustees who is appointed to assist in the coordination and voting
of the funds' proxies.

The proxy voting guidelines are just that - guidelines.  The
guidelines are not exhaustive and do not include all potential
voting issues.  Because proxy issues and the circumstances of
individual companies are so varied, there may be instances when the
funds may not vote in strict adherence to these guidelines.  For
example, the proxy voting service is expected to bring to the Proxy
Coordinator's attention proxy questions that are company-specific
and of a non-routine nature and that, even if covered by the
guidelines, may be more appropriately handled on a case-by-case
basis.

Similarly, Putnam Management's investment professionals, as part of
their ongoing review and analysis of all fund portfolio holdings,
are responsible for monitoring significant corporate developments,
including proxy proposals submitted to shareholders, and notifying
the Proxy Coordinator of circumstances where the interests of fund
shareholders may warrant a vote contrary to these guidelines.  In
such instances, the investment professionals will submit a written
recommendation to the Proxy Coordinator and the person or persons
designated by Putnam Management's Legal and Compliance Department to
assist in processing referral items pursuant to the funds' "Proxy
Voting Procedures."  The Proxy Coordinator, in consultation with the
funds' Senior Vice President, Executive Vice President, and/or the
Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee, as appropriate,
will determine how the funds' proxies will be voted.  When
indicated, the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee
may consult with other members of the Committee or the full Board of
Trustees.

The following guidelines are grouped according to the types of
proposals generally presented to shareholders.  Part I deals with
proposals that have been put forth by management and approved and
recommended by a company's board of directors.  Part II deals with
proposals submitted by shareholders for inclusion in proxy
statements.  Part III addresses unique considerations pertaining to
non-U.S. issuers.

The Putnam funds will disclose their proxy votes in accordance with
the timetable established by SEC rules (i.e., not later than August
31 of each year for the most recent 12-month period ended June 30).

I.  BOARD-APPROVED PROPOSALS
- ----------------------------

The vast majority of matters presented to shareholders for a vote
involve proposals made by a company itself (sometimes referred to as
"management proposals"), which have been approved and recommended by
its board of directors.  In view of the enhanced corporate
governance practices currently being implemented in public companies
and of the funds' intent to hold corporate boards accountable for
their actions in promoting shareholder interests, the funds' proxies
generally will be voted for the decisions reached by majority
independent boards of directors, except as otherwise indicated in
these guidelines.  Accordingly, the funds' proxies will be voted for
board-approved proposals, except as follows:

Matters relating to the Board of Directors
- ------------------------------------------

Uncontested Election of Directors

The funds' proxies will be voted for the election of a company's
nominees for the board of directors, except as follows:

The funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* the board does not have a majority of independent directors,

* the board has not established independent nominating, audit, and
compensation committees,

* the board has more than 19 members or fewer than five members,
absent special circumstances,

* the board has not acted to implement a policy requested in a
shareholder proposal that received the support of a majority of the
shares of the company at its previous two annual meetings, or

* the board has adopted or renewed a shareholder rights plan
(commonly referred to as a "poison pill") without shareholder
approval during the current or prior calendar year.

The funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director who:

* is considered an independent director by the company and who has
received compensation from the company other than for service as a
director (e.g., investment banking, consulting, legal, or financial
advisory fees),

* attends less than 75% of board and committee meetings without
valid reasons for the absences (e.g., illness, personal emergency,
etc.),

* as a director of a public company (Company A), is employed as a
senior executive of another public company (Company B) if a director
of Company B serves as a senior executive of Company A (commonly
referred to as an "interlocking directorate"), or

* serves on more than five unaffiliated public company boards (for
the purpose of this guideline, boards of affiliated registered
investment companies will count as one board).

Commentary:

Board independence:  Unless otherwise indicated, for the purposes of
determining whether a board has a majority of independent directors
and independent nominating, audit, and compensation committees, an
"independent director" is a director who (1) meets all requirements
to serve as an independent director of a company under the final
NYSE Corporate Governance Rules (e.g., no material business
relationships with the company and no present or recent employment
relationship with the company (including employment of an immediate
family member as an executive officer)), and (2) has not accepted
directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other
compensatory fee from the company other than in his or her capacity
as a member of the board of directors or any board committee.  The
funds' Trustees believe that the receipt of compensation for
services other than service as a director raises significant
independence issues.

Board size:  The funds' Trustees believe that the size of the board
of directors can have a direct impact on the ability of the board to
govern effectively.  Boards that have too many members can be
unwieldy and ultimately inhibit their ability to oversee management
performance.  Boards that have too few members can stifle innovation
and lead to excessive influence by management.

Time commitment:  Being a director of a company requires a
significant time commitment to adequately prepare for and attend the
company's board and committee meetings.  Directors must be able to
commit the time and attention necessary to perform their fiduciary
duties in proper fashion, particularly in times of crisis.  The
funds' Trustees are concerned about over-committed directors.  In
some cases, directors may serve on too many boards to make a
meaningful contribution.  This may be particularly true for senior
executives of public companies (or other directors with
substantially full-time employment) who serve on more than a few
outside boards.  The funds may withhold votes from such directors on
a case-by-case basis where it appears that they may be unable to
discharge their duties properly because of excessive commitments.

Interlocking directorships:  The funds' Trustees believe that
interlocking directorships are inconsistent with the degree of
independence required for outside directors of public companies.

Corporate governance practices:  Board independence depends not only
on its members' individual relationships, but also on the board's
overall attitude toward management.  Independent boards are
committed to good corporate governance practices and, by providing
objective independent judgment, enhancing shareholder value.  The
funds may withhold votes on a case-by-case basis from some or all
directors who, through their lack of independence, have failed to
observe good corporate governance practices or, through specific
corporate action, have demonstrated a disregard for the interest of
shareholders.

Contested Elections of Directors

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis in contested elections
of directors.

Classified Boards

The funds will vote against proposals to classify a board, absent
special circumstances indicating that shareholder interests would be
better served by this structure.

Commentary:  Under a typical classified board structure, the
directors are divided into three classes, with each class serving a
three-year term.  The classified board structure results in
directors serving staggered terms, with usually only a third of the
directors up for re-election at any given annual meeting.  The
funds' Trustees generally believe that it is appropriate for
directors to stand for election each year, but recognize that, in
special circumstances, shareholder interests may be better served
under a classified board structure.

Other Board-Related Proposals

The funds will generally vote for board-approved proposals that have
been approved by a majority independent board, and on a case-by-case
basis on board-approved proposals where the board fails to meet the
guidelines' basic independence standards (i.e., majority of
independent directors and independent nominating, audit, and
compensation committees).

Executive Compensation
- ----------------------

The funds generally favor compensation programs that relate
executive compensation to a company's long-term performance.  The
funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals
relating to executive compensation, except as follows:

Except where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors, the funds will vote for stock option and
restricted stock plans that will result in an average annual
dilution of 1.67% or less (based on the disclosed term of the plan
and including all equity-based plans).

The funds will vote against stock option and restricted stock
plans that will result in an average annual dilution of greater than
1.67% (based on the disclosed term of the plan and including all
equity-based plans).

The funds will vote against any stock option or restricted stock
plan where the company's actual grants of stock options and
restricted stock under all equity-based compensation plans during
the prior three (3) fiscal years have resulted in an average annual
dilution of greater than 1.67%.

The funds will vote against stock option plans that permit the
replacing or repricing of underwater options (and against any
proposal to authorize such replacement or repricing of underwater
options).

The funds will vote against stock option plans that permit
issuance of options with an exercise price below the stock's current
market price.

Except where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors, the funds will vote for an employee stock
purchase plan that has the following features:  (1) the shares
purchased under the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of their
market value; (2) the offering period under the plan is 27 months or
less; and (3) dilution is 10% or less.

Commentary:  Companies should have compensation programs that are
reasonable and that align shareholder and management interests over
the longer term.  Further, disclosure of compensation programs
should provide absolute transparency to shareholders regarding the
sources and amounts of, and the factors influencing, executive
compensation.  Appropriately designed equity-based compensation
plans can be an effective way to align the interests of long-term
shareholders with the interests of management.  The funds may vote
against executive compensation proposals on a case-by-case basis
where compensation is excessive by reasonable corporate standards,
or where a company fails to provide transparent disclosure of
executive compensation.  In voting on a proposal relating to
executive compensation, the funds will consider whether the proposal
has been approved by an independent compensation committee of the
board.

Capitalization
- --------------

Many proxy proposals involve changes in a company's capitalization,
including the authorization of additional stock, the issuance of
stock, the repurchase of outstanding stock, or the approval of a
stock split.  The management of a company's capital structure
involves a number of important issues, including cash flow,
financing needs, and market conditions that are unique to the
circumstances of the company.  As a result, the funds will vote on a
case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals involving changes to
a company's capitalization, except that where the funds are not
otherwise withholding votes from the entire board of directors:

The funds will vote for proposals relating to the authorization
and issuance of additional common stock (except where such proposals
relate to a specific transaction).

The funds will vote for proposals to effect stock splits
(excluding reverse stock splits).

The funds will vote for proposals authorizing share repurchase
programs.

Commentary:  A company may decide to authorize additional shares of
common stock for reasons relating to executive compensation or for
routine business purposes.  For the most part, these decisions are
best left to the board of directors and senior management.  The
funds will vote on a case-by-case basis, however, on other proposals
to change a company's capitalization, including the authorization of
common stock with special voting rights, the authorization or
issuance of common stock in connection with a specific transaction
(e.g., an acquisition, merger or reorganization), or the
authorization or issuance of preferred stock.  Actions such as these
involve a number of considerations that may affect a shareholder's
investment and that warrant a case-by-case determination.

Acquisitions, Mergers, Reincorporations, Reorganizations and Other
- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Transactions
- ------------

Shareholders may be confronted with a number of different types of
transactions, including acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations
involving business combinations, liquidations, and the sale of all
or substantially all of a company's assets, which may require their
consent.  Voting on such proposals involves considerations unique to
each transaction.  As a result, the funds will vote on a
case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals to effect these types
of transactions, except as follows:

The funds will vote for mergers and reorganizations involving
business combinations designed solely to reincorporate a company in
Delaware.

Commentary:  A company may reincorporate into another state through
a merger or reorganization by setting up a "shell" company in a
different state and then merging the company into the new company.
While reincorporation into states with extensive and established
corporate laws - notably Delaware - provides companies and
shareholders with a more well-defined legal framework, shareholders
must carefully consider the reasons for a reincorporation into
another jurisdiction, including especially an offshore jurisdiction.

Anti-Takeover Measures
- ----------------------

Some proxy proposals involve efforts by management to make it more
difficult for an outside party to take control of the company
without the approval of the company's board of directors.  These
include the adoption of a shareholder rights plan, requiring
supermajority voting on particular issues, the adoption of fair
price provisions, the issuance of blank check preferred stock, and
the creation of a separate class of stock with disparate voting
rights.  Such proposals may adversely affect shareholder rights,
lead to management entrenchment, or create conflicts of interest.
As a result, the funds will vote against board-approved proposals to
adopt such anti-takeover measures, except as follows:

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify
or approve shareholder rights plans; and

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to adopt
fair price provisions.

Commentary:  The funds' Trustees recognize that poison pills and
fair price provisions may enhance shareholder value under certain
circumstances.  As a result, the funds will consider proposals to
approve such matters on a case-by-case basis.

Other Business Matters
- ----------------------

Many proxies involve approval of routine business matters, such as
changing a company's name, ratifying the appointment of auditors,
and procedural matters relating to the shareholder meeting.  For the
most part, these routine matters do not materially affect
shareholder interests and are best left to the board of directors
and senior management of the company.  The funds will vote for
board-approved proposals approving such matters, except as follows:

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to amend
a company's charter or bylaws (except for charter amendments
necessary or to effect stock splits to change a company's name or to
authorize additional shares of common stock).

The funds will vote against authorization to transact other
unidentified, substantive business at the meeting.

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on other business
matters where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors.

Commentary:  Charter and bylaw amendments and the transaction of
other unidentified, substantive business at a shareholder meeting
may directly affect shareholder rights and have a significant impact
on shareholder value.  As a result, the funds do not view such items
as routine business matters.  Putnam Management's investment
professionals and the funds' proxy voting service may also bring to
the Proxy Coordinator's attention company-specific items that they
believe to be non-routine and warranting special consideration.
Under these circumstances, the funds will vote on a case-by-case
basis.

II.  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
- --------------------------

SEC regulations permit shareholders to submit proposals for
inclusion in a company's proxy statement.  These proposals generally
seek to change some aspect of the company's corporate governance
structure or to change some aspect of its business operations.  The
funds generally will vote in accordance with the recommendation of
the company's board of directors on all shareholder proposals,
except as follows:

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals to declassify a
board, absent special circumstances which would indicate that
shareholder interests are better served by a classified board
structure.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals to require
shareholder approval of shareholder rights plans.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals that are consistent
with the funds' proxy voting guidelines for board-approved
proposals.

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on other shareholder
proposals where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors.

Commentary:  In light of the substantial reforms in corporate
governance that are currently underway, the funds' Trustees believe
that effective corporate reforms should be promoted by holding
boards of directors - and in particular their independent directors
- - accountable for their actions, rather than imposing additional
legal restrictions on board governance through piecemeal proposals.
Generally speaking, shareholder proposals relating to business
operations are often motivated primarily by political or social
concerns, rather than the interests of shareholders as investors in
an economic enterprise.  As stated above, the funds' Trustees
believe that boards of directors and management are responsible for
ensuring that their businesses are operating in accordance with high
legal and ethical standards and should be held accountable for
resulting corporate behavior.  Accordingly, the funds will generally
support the recommendations of boards that meet the basic
independence and governance standards established in these
guidelines.  Where boards fail to meet these standards, the funds
will generally evaluate shareholder proposals on a case-by-case
basis.

III.  VOTING SHARES OF NON-U.S. ISSUERS
- ---------------------------------------

Many of the Putnam funds invest on a global basis, and, as a result,
they may be required to vote shares held in non-U.S. issuers - i.e.,
issuers that are incorporated under the laws of foreign
jurisdictions and that are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange
or the NASDAQ stock market.  Because non-U.S. issuers are
incorporated under the laws of countries and jurisdictions outside
the U.S., protection for shareholders may vary significantly from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Laws governing non-U.S. issuers may,
in some cases, provide substantially less protection for
shareholders.  As a result, the foregoing guidelines, which are
premised on the existence of a sound corporate governance and
disclosure framework, may not be appropriate under some
circumstances for non-U.S. issuers.

In many non-U.S. markets, shareholders who vote proxies of a
non-U.S. issuer are not able to trade in that company's stock on or
around the shareholder meeting date.  This practice is known as
"share blocking."  In countries where share blocking is practiced,
the funds will vote proxies only with direction from Putnam
Management's investment professionals.

In addition, some non-U.S. markets require that a company's shares
be re-registered out of the name of the local custodian or nominee
into the name of the shareholder for the meeting.  This practice is
known as "share re-registration."  As a result, shareholders,
including the funds, are not able to trade in that company's stock
until the shares are re-registered back in the name of the local
custodian or nominee.  In countries where share re-registration is
practiced, the funds will generally not vote proxies.

The funds will vote proxies of non-U.S. issuers in accordance with
the foregoing guidelines where applicable, except as follows:

Uncontested Election of Directors
- ---------------------------------

Japan

For companies that have established a U.S.-style corporate
structure, the funds will withhold votes for the entire board of
directors if

* the board does not have a majority of outside directors,

* the board has not established nominating and compensation
committees composed of a majority of outside directors, or

* the board has not established an audit committee composed of a
majority of independent directors.

The funds will withhold votes for the appointment of members of a
company's board of statutory auditors if a majority of the members
of the board of statutory auditors is not independent.

Commentary:

Board structure:  Recent amendments to the Japanese Commercial Code
give companies the option to adopt a U.S.-style corporate structure
(i.e., a board of directors and audit, nominating, and compensation
committees).  The funds will vote for proposals to amend a company's
articles of incorporation to adopt the U.S.-style corporate
structure.

Definition of outside director and independent director:  Corporate
governance principles in Japan focus on the distinction between
outside directors and independent directors.  Under these
principles, an outside director is a director who is not and has
never been a director, executive, or employee of the company or its
parent company, subsidiaries or affiliates.  An outside director is
"independent" if that person can make decisions completely
independent from the managers of the company, its parent,
subsidiaries, or affiliates and does not have a material
relationship with the company (i.e., major client, trading partner,
or other business relationship; familial relationship with current
director or executive; etc.).  The guidelines have incorporated
these definitions in applying the board independence standards
above.

Korea

The funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* the board does not have a majority of outside directors,

* the board has not established a nominating committee composed of
at least a majority of outside directors, or

* the board has not established an audit committee composed of at
least three members and in which at least two-thirds of its members
are outside directors.

Commentary:   For purposes of these guideline, an "outside director"
is a director that is independent from the management or controlling
shareholders of the company, and holds no interests that might
impair performing his or her duties impartially from the company,
management or controlling shareholder.  In determining whether a
director is an outside director, the funds will also apply the
standards included in Article 415-2(2) of the Korean Commercial Code
(i.e., no employment relationship with the company for a period of
two years before serving on the committee, no director or employment
relationship with the company's largest shareholder, etc.) and may
consider other business relationships that would affect the
independence of an outside director.

United Kingdom

The funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* the board does not have at least a majority of independent
non-executive directors,

* the board has not established nomination committees composed of a
majority of independent non-executive directors, or

* the board has not established compensation and audit committees
composed of (1) at least three directors (in the case of smaller
companies, two directors) and (2) solely of independent
non-executive directors.

The funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director who is
considered an independent director by the company and who has
received compensation from the company other than for service as a
director (e.g., investment banking, consulting, legal, or financial
advisory fees).

Commentary:

Application of guidelines:  Although the U.K.'s Combined Code on
Corporate Governance ("Combined Code") has adopted the "comply and
explain" approach to corporate governance, the funds' Trustees
believe that the guidelines discussed above with respect to board
independence standards are integral to the protection of investors
in U.K. companies.  As a result, these guidelines will be applied in
a prescriptive manner.

Definition of independence:  For the purposes of these guidelines, a
non-executive director shall be considered independent if the
director meets the independence standards in section A.3.1 of the
Combined Code (i.e., no material business or employment
relationships with the company, no remuneration from the company for
non-board services, no close family ties with senior employees or
directors of the company, etc.), except that the funds do not view
service on the board for more than nine years as affecting a
director's independence.

Smaller companies:  A smaller company is one that is below the FTSE
350 throughout the year immediately prior to the reporting year.

Canada

In January 2004, Canadian securities regulators issued proposed
policies that would impose new corporate governance requirements on
Canadian public companies.  The recommended practices contained in
these new corporate governance requirements mirror corporate
governance reforms that have been adopted by the NYSE and other U.S.
national securities exchanges and stock markets.  As a result, the
funds will vote on matters relating to the board of directors of
Canadian issuers in accordance with the guidelines applicable to
U.S. issuers.

Commentary:  Like the U.K.'s Combined Code, the proposed policies on
corporate governance issued by Canadian securities regulators embody
the "comply and explain" approach to corporate governance.  Because
the funds' Trustees believe that the board independence standards
contained in the proxy voting guidelines are integral to the
protection of investors in Canadian companies, these standards will
be applied in a prescriptive manner.

Other Matters
- -------------

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals calling for a
majority of a company's directors to be independent of management.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals seeking to increase
the independence of board nominating, audit, and compensation
committees.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals that implement
corporate governance standards similar to those established under
U.S. federal law and the listing requirements of U.S. stock
exchanges, and that do not otherwise violate the laws of the
jurisdiction under which the company is incorporated.

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals relating
to (1) the issuance of common stock in excess of 20% of the
company's outstanding common stock where shareholders do not have
preemptive rights, or (2) the issuance of common stock in excess of
100% of the company's outstanding common stock where shareholders
have preemptive rights.

As adopted December 10, 2004




Proxy Voting Procedures of the Putnam Funds
- -------------------------------------------

The proxy voting procedures below explain the role of the funds' Trustees,
the proxy voting service and the Proxy Coordinator, as well as how the
process will work when a proxy question needs to be handled on a
case-by-case basis, or when there may be a conflict of interest.

The role of the funds' Trustees
- -------------------------------------------

The Trustees of the Putnam funds exercise control of the voting of proxies
through their Board Policy and Nominating Committee, which is composed
entirely of independent Trustees.  The Board Policy and Nominating Committee
oversees the proxy voting process and participates, as needed, in the
resolution of issues that need to be handled on a case-by-case basis.  The
Committee annually reviews and recommends, for Trustee approval, guidelines
governing the funds' proxy votes, including how the funds vote on specific
proposals and which matters are to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The Trustees are assisted in this process by their independent
administrative staff ("Office of the Trustees"), independent legal counsel,
and an independent proxy voting service.  The Trustees also receive
assistance from Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the
funds' investment advisor, on matters involving investment judgments.  In
all cases, the ultimate decision on voting proxies rests with the Trustees,
acting as fiduciaries on behalf of the shareholders of the funds.

The role of the proxy voting service
- -------------------------------------------

The funds have engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
voting of proxies.  The proxy voting service is responsible for coordinating
with the funds' custodians to ensure that all proxy materials received by
the custodians relating to the funds' portfolio securities are processed in
a timely fashion.  To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service votes
all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting guidelines established by
the Trustees.  The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis.  The
proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
appear to involve unusual or controversial issues.  The funds also utilize
research services relating to proxy questions provided by the proxy voting
service and by other firms.

The role of the Proxy Coordinator
- -------------------------------------------

Each year, a member of the Office of the Trustees is appointed Proxy
Coordinator to assist in the coordination and voting of the funds' proxies.
The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy voting service and,
in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy voting service, will
solicit voting recommendations and instructions from the Office of the
Trustees, the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee, and Putnam
Management's investment professionals, as appropriate.  The Proxy
Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that these questions and referrals
are responded to in a timely fashion and for transmitting appropriate voting
instructions to the proxy voting service.

Voting procedures for referral items
- -------------------------------------------

As discussed above, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
the Proxy Coordinator under certain circumstances.  When the application of
the proxy voting guidelines is unclear or a particular proxy question is not
covered by the guidelines (and does not involve investment considerations),
the Proxy Coordinator will assist in interpreting the guidelines and, as
appropriate, consult with one of more senior staff members of the Office of
the Trustees and the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee on
how the funds' shares will be voted.

For proxy questions that require a case-by-case analysis pursuant to the
guidelines or that are not covered by the guidelines but involve investment
considerations, the Proxy Coordinator will refer such questions, through a
written request, to Putnam Management's investment professionals for a
voting recommendation.  Such referrals will be made in cooperation with the
person or persons designated by Putnam Management's Legal and Compliance
Department to assist in processing such referral items.  In connection with
each such referral item, the Legal and Compliance Department will conduct a
conflicts of interest review, as described below under "Conflicts of
Interest," and provide a conflicts of interest report (the "Conflicts
Report") to the Proxy Coordinator describing the results of such review.
After receiving a referral item from the Proxy Coordinator, Putnam
Management's investment professionals will provide a written recommendation
to the Proxy Coordinator and the person or persons designated by the Legal
and Compliance Department to assist in processing referral items.  Such
recommendation will set forth (1) how the proxies should be voted; (2) the
basis and rationale for such recommendation; and (3) any contacts the
investment professionals have had with respect to the referral item with
non-investment personnel of Putnam Management or with outside parties
(except for routine communications from proxy solicitors).  The Proxy
Coordinator will then review the investment professionals' recommendation
and the Conflicts Report with one of more senior staff members of the Office
of the Trustees in determining how to vote the funds' proxies.  The Proxy
Coordinator will maintain a record of all proxy questions that have been
referred to Putnam Management's investment professionals, the voting
recommendation, and the Conflicts Report.

In some situations, the Proxy Coordinator and/or one of more senior staff
members of the Office of the Trustees may determine that a particular proxy
question raises policy issues requiring consultation with the Chair of the
Board Policy and Nominating Committee, who, in turn, may decide to bring the
particular proxy question to the Committee or the full Board of Trustees for
consideration.

Conflicts of interest
- -------------------------------------------

Occasions may arise where a person or organization involved in the proxy
voting process may have a conflict of interest.  A conflict of interest may
exist, for example, if Putnam Management has a business relationship with
(or is actively soliciting business from) either the company soliciting the
proxy or a third party that has a material interest in the outcome of a
proxy vote or that is actively lobbying for a particular outcome of a proxy
vote.  Any individual with knowledge of a personal conflict of interest
(e.g., familial relationship with company management) relating to a
particular referral item shall disclose that conflict to the Proxy
Coordinator and the Legal and Compliance Department and otherwise remove
himself or herself from the proxy voting process.  The Legal and Compliance
Department will review each item referred to Putnam Management's investment
professionals to determine if a conflict of interest exists and will provide
the Proxy Coordinator with a Conflicts Report for each referral item that
(1) describes any conflict of interest; (2) discusses the procedures used to
address such conflict of interest; and (3) discloses any contacts from
parties outside Putnam Management (other than routine communications from
proxy solicitors) with respect to the referral item not otherwise reported
in an investment professional's recommendation.  The Conflicts Report will
also include written confirmation that any recommendation from an investment
professional provided under circumstances where a conflict of interest
exists was made solely on the investment merits and without regard to any
other consideration.

OVERVIEW

Every Putnam employee is required, as a condition of continued
employment, to read, understand, and comply with the entire Code of
Ethics. Additionally, employees are expected to comply with the policies
and procedures contained within the Putnam Employee Handbook, which can
be accessed online through www.ibenefitcenter.com. This overview is
provided only as a convenience and is not intended to substitute for a
careful reading of the complete document.

It is the personal responsibility of every Putnam employee to avoid any
conduct that could create a conflict, or even the appearance of a
conflict, with our fund shareholders or other clients, or do anything
that could damage or erode the trust our clients place in Putnam and its
employees. This is the spirit of the Code of Ethics. In accepting
employment at Putnam, every employee accepts the absolute obligation to
comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code of Ethics. Failure to
comply with the spirit of the Code of Ethics is just as much a violation
of the Code as failure to comply with the written rules of the Code.

The rules of the Code cover activities, including personal securities
transactions, of Putnam employees, certain family members of employees,
and entities (such as corporations, trusts, or partnerships) that
employees may be deemed to control or influence.

Sanctions will be imposed for violations of the Code of Ethics.
Sanctions may include bans on personal trading, reductions in salary
increases or bonuses, disgorgement of trading profits, suspension of
employment, and termination of employment.

Insider trading

Putnam employees are forbidden to buy or sell any security while either
Putnam or the employee is in possession of material, non-public
information (inside information) concerning the security or the issuer.
A violation of Putnam's insider trading policies may result in criminal
and civil penalties, including imprisonment and substantial fines. An
employee aware of or in possession of inside information must report it
immediately to the Code of Ethics Officer. See Appendix A, Section ll:
Overview of Insider Trading.

Conflicts of interest

The Code of Ethics imposes limits on activities of Putnam employees
where the activity may conflict with the interests of Putnam or its
clients. These include limits on the receipt and solicitation of gifts
and on service as a fiduciary for a person or entity outside of Putnam.

For example, Putnam employees generally may not accept gifts over $100
in total value in a calendar year from any entity or any supplier of
goods or services to Putnam. In addition, a Putnam employee may not
serve as a director of any corporation or other entity without prior
approval of the Code of Ethics Officer, and Putnam employees may not be
members of investment clubs.

Confidentiality

Information about Putnam clients and Putnam investment activity and
research is proprietary and confidential and may not be disclosed or
used by any Putnam employee outside Putnam without a valid business
purpose.

Personal securities trading

Putnam employees may not buy or sell any security for their own account
without clearing the proposed transaction in advance. Clearance is
facilitated through the online pre-clearance system for equity
securities, and directly with the Code of Ethics Administrator for
fixed-income securities and transactions in Putnam closed-end funds.
Certain securities are exempted from this pre-clearance requirement
(e.g., shares of open-end (not closed-end) mutual funds).

Clearance must be obtained in advance, between 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the day of the trade, except in the case
of a trade for up to 1,000 shares of stock of an issuer whose
capitalization exceeds $5 billion, clearance may be obtained between
9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST on the day of the trade.  A clearance is
valid only for the day it is obtained. Putnam employees are strongly
discouraged from engaging in excessive trading for their personal
accounts. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2004, employees will be
prohibited from making more than 25 trades in individual securities.
Trading in excess of this level will be reviewed with the Code of Ethics
Oversight Committee.

Putnam mutual funds

All employees and certain family members are subject to a minimum 90-day
holding period for shares in Putnam's open-end mutual funds. This
restriction does not apply to Putnam's money market funds. Except in
limited circumstances, all employees must hold Putnam open-end fund
shares in accounts at Putnam Preferred Access.

Portfolio managers and others with access to investment information
(so-called "Access Persons") are subject to a minimum one-year holding
period for holding Putnam open-end fund shares.

Short selling

Putnam employees are prohibited from short selling any security, whether
or not it is held in a Putnam client portfolio, except that short
selling against broad market indexes and "against the box" are
permitted. Note, however, that short selling "against the box" or
otherwise hedging an investment in shares of Marsh & McLennan (MMC)
stock is prohibited.

Confirmations of trading and periodic account statements

All Putnam employees must have their brokers send confirmations and
statements of personal securities transactions, including transactions
of immediate family members and accounts over which the employee has
investment discretion, to the Code of Ethics Officer. Employees must
contact the Code of Ethics Administrator to obtain an authorization
letter from Putnam for setting up a personal brokerage account.

Quarterly and annual reporting

Access persons must report all their securities transactions in each
calendar quarter to the Code of Ethics Officer within 10 days after the
end of the quarter. All Access Persons must disclose all personal
securities holdings (even those to which pre-clearance may not apply)
upon commencement of employment and thereafter on an annual basis. You
will be notified if these requirements apply to you. If these
requirements apply to you and you fail to report as required, salary
increases and bonuses may be reduced. Egregious conduct, e.g., willful
failures to report, will be subject to harsher sanctions, which may
include termination of employment.

IPOs and private placements

Putnam employees may not buy any securities in an initial public
offering or in a private placement, except in limited circumstances when
prior written authorization is obtained.

Personal securities transactions by Access Persons
and certain investment professionals

The Code imposes several special restrictions on personal securities
transactions by Access Persons and certain investment professionals,
which are summarized as follows. (Refer to Section II for details):

* 60-Day Holding Period. No Access Person shall purchase and then sell
at a profit, or sell and then repurchase at a lower price, any security
or related derivative security within 60 calendar days.

* 7-Day Rule. Before a portfolio manager places an order to buy a
security for any portfolio he manages, he must sell from his personal
account any such security or related derivative security purchased
within the preceding seven calendar days and disgorge any profit from
the sale.

* Blackout Rules. No portfolio manager may sell any security or related
derivative security for her personal account until seven calendar days
have passed since the most recent purchase of that security or related
derivative security by any portfolio she manages. No portfolio manager
may buy any security or related derivative security for his personal
account until seven calendar days have passed since the most recent sale
of that security or related derivative security by any portfolio he
manages.

* Contra-Trading Rule. No portfolio manager may sell out of her personal
account any security or related derivative security that is held in any
portfolio she manages unless she has received the written approval of an
appropriate CIO and the Code of Ethics Officer.

* No portfolio manager may cause a Putnam client to take action for the
manager's own personal benefit.

Similar rules limit personal securities transactions by analysts,
co-managers, and chief investment officers. Please read these rules
carefully as you are responsible for understanding the restrictions.


PREAMBLE

It is the personal responsibility of every Putnam employee to avoid any
conduct that would create a conflict, or even the appearance of a
conflict, with our fund shareholders or other clients, or do anything
that could damage or erode the trust our clients place in Putnam and its
employees. This is the spirit of the Code of Ethics. In accepting
employment at Putnam, every employee also accepts the absolute
obligation to comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code of
Ethics. Failure to comply with the spirit of the Code of Ethics is just
as much a violation of the Code as failure to comply with the written
rules of the Code. Sanctions will be imposed for violations of the Code
of Ethics, including the Code's reporting requirements.

Sanctions may include bans on personal trading, reductions in salary
increases or bonuses, disgorgement of trading profits, suspension of
employment, and termination of employment.

Putnam Investments is required by law to adopt a Code of Ethics. The
purposes of the law are to ensure that companies and their employees
comply with all applicable laws and to prevent abuses in the investment
advisory business that can arise when conflicts of interest exist
between the employees of an investment advisor and its clients. By
adopting and enforcing a Code of Ethics, we strengthen the trust and
confidence reposed in us by demonstrating that, at Putnam, client
interests come before personal interests.

The Code that follows represents a balancing of important interests. On
the one hand, as a registered investment advisor, Putnam owes a duty of
undivided loyalty to its clients, and must avoid even the appearance of
a conflict that might be perceived as abusing the trust they have placed
in Putnam. On the other hand, Putnam does not want to prevent
conscientious professionals from investing for their own account where
conflicts do not exist or are so attenuated as to be immaterial to
investment decisions affecting Putnam clients.

When conflicting interests cannot be reconciled, the Code makes clear
that, first and foremost, Putnam employees owe a fiduciary duty to
Putnam clients. In most cases, this means that the affected employee
will be required to forego conflicting personal securities transactions.
In some cases, personal investments will be permitted, but only in a
manner, which, because of the circumstances and applicable controls,
cannot reasonably be perceived as adversely affecting Putnam client
portfolios or taking unfair advantage of the relationship Putnam
employees have to Putnam clients.

The Code contains specific rules prohibiting defined types of conflicts.
Because every potential conflict cannot be anticipated in advance, the
Code also contains certain general provisions prohibiting conflict
situations. In view of these general provisions, it is critical that any
individual who is in doubt about the applicability of the Code in a
given situation seek a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer
about the propriety of the conduct in advance. The procedures for
obtaining such a determination are described in Section VII of the Code.

It is critical that the Code be strictly observed. Not only will
adherence to the Code ensure that Putnam renders the best possible
service to its clients, it will ensure that no individual is liable for
violations of law.

It should be emphasized that adherence to this policy is a fundamental
condition of employment at Putnam. Every employee is expected to adhere
to the requirements of this Code of Ethics despite any inconvenience
that may be involved. Any employee failing to do so may be subject to
such disciplinary action, including financial penalties and termination
of employment, as determined by the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee
or the Chief Executive Officer of Putnam Investments.

SECTION I

Personal Securities Rules for All Employees

A. Pre-clearance and the Restricted List

Rule 1

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell for his personal account any
security (other than shares of open-end investment companies) without
prior clearance obtained through Putnam's intranet pre-clearance system
(under the @Putnam tab of www.ibenefitcenter.com). Fixed-income
securities must be pre-cleared by calling the Code of Ethics
Administrator, and there are special rules for trading in Putnam
closed-end funds. See Appendix B. Subject to the limited exceptions
below, no clearance will be granted for securities appearing on the

Restricted List. Securities will be placed on the Restricted List in the
following circumstances:

(a) When orders to purchase or sell such security have been entered for
any Putnam client, or the security is being actively considered for
purchase for any Putnam client, unless the security is a nonconvertible
investment grade rated (BBB by S&P or Baa by Moody's) fixed-income
investment;

(b) When such a security is a voting security of a corporation in the
banking, savings and loan, communications, or gaming (i.e., casinos)
industries, if holdings of Putnam clients in that corporation exceed 7%
(for public utilities, the threshold is 4%);

(c) When, in the judgment of the Code of Ethics Officer, other
circumstances warrant restricting personal transactions of Putnam
employees in a particular security;

(d) The circumstances described in the Policy Statement Concerning
Insider Trading Prohibitions, attached as Appendix A.

Reminder: Securities for an employee's personal account include
securities owned by certain family members of a Putnam employee. Thus,
this Rule prohibits certain trades by family members of Putnam
employees. See Definitions.

Compliance with this rule does not exempt an employee from complying
with any other applicable rules of the Code, such as those described in
Section III. In particular, Access Persons and certain investment
professionals must comply with the special rules set forth in Section
II.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. Maintenance of Restricted List. The Restricted List shall be
maintained by the Code of Ethics Administrator.

B. Consulting Restricted List. An employee wishing to trade any security
for his personal account shall first obtain clearance through Putnam's
Intranet pre-clearance system. The system may be accessed online at
ibenefitcenter.com. Select Employee Essentials under the @Putnam tab.
Employees may pre-clear all securities between 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
EST, and may pre-clear purchases or sales of up to 1,000 shares of
issuers having a market capitalization of more than $5 billion between
9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST.

Requests to make personal securities transactions may not be made using
the system or presented to the Code of Ethics Administrator after
4:00 p.m. EST.

Pre-clearance of fixed income securities and Putnam closed-end funds
must be made by calling the Code of Ethics Administrator.

The pre-clearance system will inform the employee whether the security
may be traded and whether trading in the security is subject to the
"Large Cap" limitation. The response of the pre-clearance system as to
whether a security appears on the Restricted List and, if so, whether it
is eligible for the exceptions set forth after this Rule shall be final,
unless the employee appeals to the Code of Ethics Officer, using the
procedure described in Section VII, regarding the request to trade a
particular security.

A clearance is only valid for trading on the day it is obtained. Trades
in securities listed on Asian or European stock exchanges, however, may
be executed within one business day after pre-clearance is obtained.

If a security is not on the Restricted List, other classes of securities
of the same issuer (e.g., preferred or convertible preferred stock) may
be on the Restricted List. It is the employee's responsibility to
identify with particularity the class of securities for which permission
is being sought for a personal investment.

If the pre-clearance system does not recognize a security, or if an
employee is unable to use the system or has any questions with respect
to the system or pre-clearance, the employee may consult the Code of
Ethics Administrator. The Code of Ethics Administrator shall not have
authority to answer any questions about a security other than whether
trading is permitted. The response of the Code of Ethics Administrator
as to whether a security appears on the Restricted List and, if so,
whether it is eligible for any applicable exceptions set forth after
this Rule shall be final, unless the employee appeals to the Code of
Ethics Officer, using the procedure described in Section VII, regarding
the request to trade a particular security.


EXCEPTIONS

A. Large Cap Exception. If a security appearing on the Restricted List
is an equity security for which the issuer has a market capitalization
(defined as outstanding shares multiplied by current price per share) of
over $5 billion, then a Putnam employee may purchase or sell up to 1,000
shares of the security per day for his personal account. This exception
does not apply if the security appears on the Restricted List in the
circumstances described in subpart (b), (c), or (d) of Rule 1.

B. Pre-clearing Transactions Effected by Share Subscription. The
purchase of securities made by subscription rather than on an exchange
are limited to issuers having a market capitalization of $5 billion or
more and are subject to a 1,000 share limit. The following are
procedures to comply with Rule 1 when effecting a purchase or sale of
shares by subscription:

(a) The Putnam employee must pre-clear the trade on the day he or she
submits a subscription to the issuer, rather than on the actual day of
the trade since the actual day of the trade typically will not be known
to the employee who submits the subscription. At the time of
pre-clearance, the employee will be told whether the purchase is
permitted (in the case of a corporation having a market capitalization
of $5 billion or more), or not permitted (in the case of a smaller
capitalization issuer).

(b) The subscription for any purchase or sale of shares must be reported
on the employee's quarterly personal securities transaction report,
noting the trade was accomplished by subscription.

(c) Because no brokers are involved in the transaction, the confirmation
requirement will be waived for these transactions, although the Putnam
employee must provide the Legal and Compliance Department with any
transaction summaries or statements sent by the issuer.

C. Trades in Approved Discretionary Brokerage Accounts. A transaction
does not need to be pre-cleared if it takes place in an account that the
Code of Ethics Officer has approved in writing as exempt from the
pre-clearance requirement. In the sole discretion of the Code of Ethics
Officer accounts that will be considered for exclusion from the
pre-clearance requirement are only those for which an employee's
securities broker or investment advisor has complete discretion (a
discretionary account) and the following conditions are met (i) the
employee certifies annually in writing that the employee has no
influence over the transactions in the discretionary account and is not
aware of the transactions in the discretionary account prior to their
execution, (ii) the compliance department of the employee's broker or
investment advisor certifies annually in writing that the employee has
no influence over the transactions in the discretionary account and is
not aware of the transactions in the discretionary account prior to
their execution; and (iii) each calendar quarter, the broker or
investment advisor sends Putnam's Code of Ethics Administrator copies of
each quarterly statement for the discretionary account. Employees
wishing to seek such an exemption must send a written request to the
Code of Ethics Administrator.


COMMENTS

* Pre-clearance. Subpart (a) of Rule 1 is designed to avoid the conflict
of interest that might occur when an employee trades for his personal
account a security that currently is being traded or is likely to be
traded for a Putnam client. Such conflicts arise, for example, when the
trades of an employee might have an impact on the price or availability
of a particular security, or when the trades of the client might have an
impact on price to the benefit of the employee. Thus, exceptions involve
situations where the trade of a Putnam employee is unlikely to have an
impact on the market.

* Regulatory Limits. Owing to a variety of federal statutes and
regulations in the banking, savings and loan, communications, and gaming
industries, it is critical that accounts of Putnam clients not hold more
than 10% of the voting securities (5% for public utilities) of any
issuer in those industries. Because of the risk that the personal
holdings of Putnam employees may be aggregated with Putnam holdings for
these purposes, subpart (b) of this Rule limits personal trades in these
areas. The 7% limit (4% for public utilities) will allow the regulatory
limits to be observed.

* Options. For the purposes of this Code, options are treated like the
underlying security. See Definitions. Thus, an employee may not
purchase, sell, or "write" option contracts for a security that is on
the Restricted List. The automatic exercise of an options contract (the
purchase or writing of which was previously pre-cleared) does not have
to be pre-cleared. Note, however, that the sale of securities obtained
through the exercise of options must be pre-cleared.

* Involuntary transactions. Involuntary personal securities transactions
are exempted from the Code. Special attention should be paid to this
exemption. (See Section I.D.)

* Tender offers. This Rule does not prohibit an employee from tendering
securities from his personal account in response to an any and all
tender offer, even if Putnam clients are also tendering securities. A
Putnam employee is, however, prohibited from tendering securities from
his personal account in response to a partial tender offer, if Putnam
clients are also tendering securities.

* MMC securities. The pre-clearance, reporting and the rules applicable
to personal trading apply to securities of MMC, including MMC shares
held in the Putnam 401(k) plans and in the MMC Stock Purchase Plan.


SANCTION GUIDELINES

A. Failure to Pre-clear a Personal Trade

* First violation: One month trading ban with written warning that a
future violation will result in a longer trading ban.

* Second violation: Three month trading ban and written notice to the
Senior Managing Director of the employee's division.

* Third violation: Six month trading ban with possible longer or
permanent trading ban based upon review by Code of Ethics Oversight
Committee.

B. Failure to Pre-clear Securities on the Restricted List

* First violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, one
month trading ban, and written warning that a future violation will
result in a longer trading ban.

* Second violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction,
three month trading ban, and written notice to the Senior Managing
Director of the employee's division.

* Third violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, and
six month trading ban with possible longer or permanent trading ban
based upon review by Code of Ethics Oversight Committee.

NOTE

These are the sanction guidelines for successive failures to pre-clear
personal trades within a two-year period. The Code of Ethics Oversight
Committee retains the right to increase or decrease the sanction for a
particular violation in light of the circumstances. The Committee's
belief that an employee has violated the Code of Ethics intentionally
will result in more severe sanctions than outlined in the guidelines
above. The sanctions described in paragraph B apply to Restricted List
securities that are: (a) small-cap stocks (i.e., stocks not entitled to
the Large Cap exception) and (b) large-cap stocks that exceed the daily
1,000 share maximum permitted under the Large Cap exception. Failure to
pre-clear an otherwise permitted trade of up to 1,000 shares of a
large-cap security is subject to the sanctions described above in
paragraph A.

B. Prohibited Transactions

Rule 1

Putnam employees are prohibited from short selling any security, whether
or not the security is held in a Putnam client portfolio. Employees are
prohibited from hedging investments made in securities of MMC.


EXCEPTIONS

Short selling against broad market indexes (such as the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, the NASDAQ index, and the S&P 100 and 500 indexes)
and short selling against the box are permitted (except that short
selling shares of MMC against the box is not permitted).

Rule 2

No Putnam employee shall purchase any security for her personal account
in an initial public offering.


EXCEPTION

Pre-existing Status Exception. A Putnam employee shall not be barred by
this Rule or by Rule 1(a) of Section I.A. from purchasing securities for
her personal account in connection with an initial public offering of
securities by a bank or insurance company when the employee's status as
a policyholder or depositor entitles her to purchase securities on terms
more favorable than those available to the general public, in connection
with the bank's conversion from mutual or cooperative form to stock
form, or the insurance company's conversion from mutual to stock form,
provided that the employee has had the status entitling her to purchase
on favorable terms for at least two years. This exception is only
available with respect to the value of bank deposits or insurance
policies that an employee owns before the announcement of the initial
public offering. This exception does not apply, however, if the security
appears on the Restricted List in the circumstances set forth in
subparts (b), (c), or (d) of Section I.A., Rule 1.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. General Implementation. An employee shall inquire, before any
purchase of a security for her personal account, whether the security to
be purchased is being offered pursuant to an initial public offering. If
the security is offered through an initial public offering, the employee
shall refrain from purchasing that security for her personal account
unless the exception applies.

B. Administration of Exception. If the employee believes the exception
applies, she shall consult the Code of Ethics Administrator concerning
whether the security appears on the Restricted List and if so, whether
it is eligible for this exception.


COMMENTS

* The purpose of this Rule is twofold. First, it is designed to prevent
a conflict of interest between Putnam employees and Putnam clients who
might be in competition for the same securities in a limited public
offering. Second, the Rule is designed to prevent Putnam employees from
being subject to undue influence as a result of receiving favors in the
form of special allocations of securities in a public offering from
broker-dealers who seek to do business with Putnam.

* Purchases of securities in the immediate after-market of an initial
public offering are not prohibited, provided they do not constitute
violations of other portions of the Code of Ethics. For example,
participation in the immediate after-market as a result of a special
allocation from an underwriting group would be prohibited by Section
III, Rule 3 concerning gifts and other favors.

* Public offerings subsequent to initial public offerings are not deemed
to create the same potential for competition between Putnam employees
and Putnam clients because of the pre-existence of a market for the
securities.

Rule 3

No Putnam employee shall purchase any security for his personal account
in a limited private offering or private placement. Privately placed
limited partnerships are specifically included in this Rule.


COMMENTS

* The purpose of this Rule is to prevent a Putnam employee from
investing in securities for his own account pursuant to a limited
private offering that could compete with or disadvantage Putnam clients,
and to prevent Putnam employees from being subject to efforts to curry
favor by those who seek to do business with Putnam.

* Exemptions to the prohibition will generally not be granted where the
proposed investment relates directly or indirectly to investments by a
Putnam client, or where individuals involved in the offering (including
the issuers, broker, underwriter, placement agent, promoter, fellow
investors and affiliates of the foregoing) have any prior or existing
business relationship with Putnam or a Putnam employee, or where the
Putnam employee believes that such individuals may expect to have a
future business relationship with Putnam or a Putnam employee.

* An exemption may be granted, subject to reviewing all the facts and
circumstances, for investments in:

(a) Pooled investment funds, including hedge funds, subject to the
condition that an employee investing in a pooled investment fund would
have no involvement in the activities or decision-making process of the
fund except for financial reports made in the ordinary course of the
fund's business, and subject to the condition that the hedge fund does
not invest significantly in registered investment companies.

(b) Private placements where the investment cannot relate, or be
expected to relate, directly or indirectly to Putnam or investments by a
Putnam client.

* Employees who apply for an exemption will be expected to disclose to
the Code of Ethics Officer in writing all facts and relationships
relating to the proposed investment.

* Applications to invest in private placements will be reviewed by the
Code of Ethics Oversight Committee. This review will take into account,
among other factors, the considerations described in the preceding
comments.

Rule 4

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security for her personal
account or for any Putnam client account while in possession of
material, nonpublic information concerning the security or the issuer.


EXCEPTIONS

None. Please read Appendix A, Policy Statement Concerning Insider
Trading Prohibitions.

Rule 5

No Putnam employee shall purchase from or sell to a Putnam client any
securities or other property for his personal account, nor engage in any
personal transaction to which a Putnam client is known to be a party, or
which transaction may have a significant relationship to any action
taken by a Putnam client.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

It shall be the responsibility of every Putnam employee to make inquiry
prior to any personal transaction sufficient to satisfy himself that the
requirements of this Rule have been met.


COMMENT

This rule is required by federal law. It does not prohibit a Putnam
employee from purchasing any shares of an open-end Putnam fund. The
policy with respect to employee trading in closed-end Putnam funds is
attached as Appendix B.

Rule 6

Putnam employees may not hold shares of Putnam open-end U.S. mutual
funds other than through accounts maintained at Putnam through Putnam
Preferred Access (PPA). Employees placing purchase orders in shares of
Putnam open-end funds must place such orders through Putnam and not
through an outside broker or other intermediary. Employees redeeming or
exchanging shares of Putnam open-end funds must place those orders
through Putnam and not through an outside broker or other intermediary.
Contact a PPA representative at 1-800-634-1590 for instructions on how
to transfer these funds.

NOTE:

For purposes of this Rule, "employee" includes:

* Members of the immediate family of a Putnam employee who share the
same household as the employee or for whom the Putnam employee has
investment discretion (family member);

* Any trust in which a Putnam employee or family member is a trustee
with investment discretion and in which such Putnam employee or any
family member are collectively beneficiaries;

* Any closely-held entity (such as a partnership, limited liability
company, or corporation) in which a Putnam employee and his or her
family members hold a controlling interest and with respect to which
they have investment discretion; and

* Any account (including any retirement, pension, deferred compensation,
or similar account) in which a Putnam employee or family member has a
substantial economic interest and over which said Putnam employee or
family member exercises investment discretion.


COMMENTS

* These requirements also apply to self-directed IRA accounts holding
Putnam fund shares.

* For Putnam Profit Sharing Plan or other Putnam deferred compensation
accounts, trades may continue to be placed through ibenefitcenter.com.

* These Rules apply to variable insurance accounts, which invest in
Putnam Variable Trust such as the Putnam/Hartford Capital Manager.
Employees must designate Putnam Retail Management as the broker of
record for all such accounts.


EXCEPTION

Retirement, pension, deferred compensation and similar accounts that
cannot be legally transferred to Putnam are not subject to the
requirement. For example, a spouse of a Putnam employee may have a
401(k) plan with her employer that invests in Putnam funds. Any employee
who continues to hold shares in open-end Putnam funds outside of Putnam
must notify the Code of Ethics Officer in writing of the account
information, provide the reason why the account cannot be transferred to
Putnam and arrange for a quarterly statement of transaction in such
account to be sent to the Code of Ethics Administrator.

Rule 7

(a) Employees defined in Rule 6 may not, within a 90-calendar day
period, make a purchase followed by a sale, or a sale followed by a
purchase, of shares of the same open-end Putnam mutual fund even if the
transactions occur in different accounts.

(b) Employees who are Access Persons may not, within a one-year period,
make a purchase followed by a sale, or a sale followed by a purchase, of
shares of the same open-end Putnam mutual fund or of shares of any U.S.
registered mutual fund to which Putnam acts as advisor or sub-advisor
even if the transactions occur in different accounts.


COMMENTS

* This restriction applies across all accounts maintained by an employee
as follows:

An employee who buys shares of an open-end Putnam mutual fund may not
sell any shares of the same mutual fund until 90 calendar days have
passed.

Example. If an employee buys shares of a Putnam fund on Day 1 for a
retail account and then sells (by exchange) shares of the same fund for
his or her Putnam Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan account on Day 85, the
employee has violated the rule.

Similarly, an employee who sells shares of an open-end Putnam mutual
fund may not buy any shares of the same mutual fund until 90 calendar
days have passed.

Example. If an employee sells shares of a Putnam fund on day 1 for a
retail account and then sells (by exchange out) shares of the same fund
for his or her Putnam Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan account on day 85, the
employee may not buy (or exchange in) shares of that fund in any account
until day 176, which is more than 90 days after the most recent sale of
shares of that fund.

* The purpose of these blackout periods restriction is to prevent any
market timing, or appearance of market timing activity.

* This Rule applies to transactions by a Putnam employee in any type of
account, including retail, IRA, variable annuity, college savings 529
plans, Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan, and any deferred compensation
accounts.

* The minimum sanction for an initial violation of the blackout period
shall be disgorgement of any profit made on the transaction. Additional
sanctions may apply, including termination of employment.


EXCEPTIONS

A. This restriction does not apply to Putnam's money market funds and
Putnam Stable Value Fund.

B. Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan Contributions and Payroll Deductions. The
90-day restriction is not triggered by initial allocation of regular
employee or employer contributions or forfeitures to an employee's
account under the terms of Putnam employee benefit plans or a Putnam
payroll deduction direct investment program; later exchanges of these
contributions will be subject to the 90-day blackout period.

C. Systematic Programs. This restriction does not apply with respect to
shares sold or acquired as a result of participation in a systematic
program for contributions, withdrawals or exchanges, provided that an
election to participate in any such program and the participation dates
of the program may not be changed more often than quarterly after the
program is elected by the employee. Access Persons may elect a quarterly
or semiannual rebalancing program although it may only be changed on an
annual basis;

D. Employee Benefit Plan Withdrawals and Distributions. This restriction
does not apply with respect to shares sold for withdrawals, loans or
distributions under the terms of Putnam employee benefit plans;

E. Dividends, Distributions, Mergers, and Share Class Conversions. This
restriction does not apply with respect to the requisitioned shares as a
result of reinvestment of dividends, distributions, mergers, conversions
of share classes, or other similar actions. Subsequent transactions with
respect to the shares will be covered.

F. In special situations, Putnam's Code of Ethics Oversight Committee
may grant exceptions to the blackout periods as a result of death,
disability, or special circumstances (such as, personal hardship), all
as determined from time to time by the Committee. Employees can request
an exception by submitting a written request to the Code of Ethics
Officer.

Rule 8: Good Until Canceled Orders

Good Until Canceled (GTC) Orders and Limit Orders are prohibited.

Any order not executed on the day of pre-clearance must be resubmitted
for pre-clearance before being executed on a subsequent day. "Good until
canceled" or "limit" orders are prohibited because of the potential
failure to pre-clear.

Rule 9: Excessive Trading

Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in excessive
trading for their personal accounts. Beginning with the fourth quarter
of 2004, employees will be prohibited from making more than 25 trades in
individual securities in any given quarter. Excessive trading within
Putnam open-end mutual funds is prohibited.


COMMENTS

* Although a Putnam employee's excessive trading may not itself
constitute a conflict of interest with Putnam clients, Putnam believes
that its clients' confidence in Putnam will be enhanced and the
likelihood of Putnam achieving better investment results for its clients
over the long term will be increased if Putnam employees rely on their
investment-- as opposed to trading-- skills in transactions for their
own account. Moreover, excessive trading by a Putnam employee for his or
her own account diverts an employee's attention from the responsibility
of servicing Putnam clients, and increases the possibilities for
transactions that are in actual or apparent conflict with Putnam client
transactions. Short-term trading is strongly discouraged while employees
are encouraged to take a long-term view.

* Employees should be aware that their trading activity is closely
monitored. Ten trades or more per quarter will be discouraged and will
warrant a review memo. Activity exceeding 25 trades per quarter will be
prohibited by the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee. Sanctions will be
imposed such as a trading ban or a more stringent sanction may be
determined at the discretion of the Committee. Different rules apply
with respect to trading in shares of Putnam open-end mutual funds. See
Section I. B, Rule 7 above.

C. Discouraged Transactions

Rule 1

Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in writing
(selling) naked options for their personal accounts.

Naked option transactions are particularly dangerous, because a Putnam
employee may be prevented by the restrictions in this Code of Ethics
from covering the naked option at the appropriate time. All employees
should keep in mind the limitations on their personal securities trading
imposed by this Code when contemplating such an investment strategy.
Engaging in naked options transactions on the basis of material,
nonpublic information is prohibited. See Appendix A, Policy Statement
Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

D. Exempted Transactions

Rule 1

Transactions that are involuntary on the part of a Putnam employee are
exempt from the prohibitions set forth in Sections I.A., I.B., and I.C.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* This exemption is based on categories of conduct that the Securities
and Exchange Commission does not consider "abusive."

* Examples of involuntary personal securities transactions include:

(a) Sales out of the brokerage account of a Putnam employee as a result
of bona fide margin call, provided that withdrawal of collateral by the
Putnam employee within the ten days previous to the margin call was not
a contributing factor to the margin call;

(b) Purchases arising out of an automatic dividend reinvestment program
of an issuer of a publicly traded security.

* Transactions by a trust in which the Putnam employee (or a member of
his immediate family) holds a beneficial interest, but for which the
employee has no direct or indirect influence or control with respect to
the selection of investments, are involuntary transactions. In addition,
these transactions do not fall within the definition of "personal
securities transactions." See Definitions.

* A good-faith belief on the part of the employee that a transaction was
involuntary will not be a defense to a violation of the Code of Ethics.
In the event of confusion as to whether a particular transaction is
involuntary, the burden is on the employee to seek a prior written
determination of the applicability of this exemption. The procedures for
obtaining such a determination appear in Section VII, Part 4.

Rule 2

Transactions that have been determined in writing by the Code of Ethics
Officer before the transaction occurs to be no more than remotely
harmful to Putnam clients because the transaction would be very unlikely
to affect a highly institutional market, or because the transaction is
clearly not related economically to the securities to be purchased,
sold, or held by a Putnam client, are exempt from the prohibitions set
forth in Sections I.A., I.B., and I.C.


IMPLEMENTATION

An employee may seek an ad-hoc exemption under this Rule by following
the procedures in Section VII, Part 4.


COMMENTS

* This exemption is also based upon categories of conduct that the
Securities and Exchange Commission does not consider "abusive."

* The burden is on the employee to seek a prior written determination
that the proposed transaction meets the standards for an ad hoc
exemption set forth in this Rule.


SECTION II
Additional Special Rules for Personal Securities Transactions of Access
Persons and Certain Investment Professionals

Access Persons (including all investment professionals and other
employees as defined on page vii)

Rule 1: 60-Day Rule

No Access Person shall purchase and then sell at a profit, or sell and
then repurchase at a lower price, any security or related derivative
security within 60 calendar days.


EXCEPTIONS

None, unless prior written approval from the Code of Ethics Officer is
obtained. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis when no
abuse is involved and the equities of the situation support an
exemption. For example, although an Access Person may buy a stock as a
long-term investment, that stock may have to be sold involuntarily due
to unforeseen activity such as a merger.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. The 60-Day Rule applies to all Access Persons, as defined in the
Definitions section of the Code.

B. Calculation of whether there has been a profit is based upon the
market prices of the securities. The calculation is not net of
commissions or other sales charges.

C. As an example, an Access Person would not be permitted to sell a
security at $12 that he purchased within the prior 60 days for $10.
Similarly, an Access Person would not be permitted to purchase a
security at $10 that she had sold within the prior 60 days for $12.


COMMENTS

* The prohibition against short-term trading profits by Access Persons
is designed to minimize the possibility that they will capitalize
inappropriately on the market impact of trades involving a client
portfolio about which they might possibly have information.

* Although chief investment officers, portfolio managers, and analysts
may sell securities at a profit within 60 days of purchase in order to
comply with the requirements of the 7-Day Rule applicable to them
(described below), the profit will have to be disgorged to charity under
the terms of the 7-Day Rule.

* Effective in the fourth quarter of 2004, the 60-Day Rule will become a
Black Out Rule. An Access Person cannot trade a security within 60 days
regardless of tax lot election.

Certain Investment Professionals

Rule 2: 7-Day Rule

(a) Portfolio Managers: Before a portfolio manager (including a chief
investment officer with respect to an account he manages) places an
order to buy a security for any Putnam client portfolio that he manages,
he shall sell any such security or related derivative security purchased
in a transaction for his personal account within the preceding seven
calendar days.

(b) Comanagers: Before a portfolio manager places an order to buy a
security for any Putnam client he manages, his comanager shall sell any
such security or related derivative security purchased in a transaction
for his personal account within the preceding seven calendar days.

(c) Analysts: Before an analyst makes a buy recommendation for a
security (including designation of a security for inclusion in the
portfolio of the Putnam Research Fund), he shall sell any such security
or related derivative security purchased in a transaction for his
personal account within the preceding seven calendar days.


COMMENTS

* This Rule applies to portfolio managers (including chief investment
officers (CIO) with respect to accounts they manage) in connection with
any purchase (no matter how small) in any client account managed by that
portfolio manager or CIO (even so-called "clone accounts"). In
particular, it should be noted that the requirements of this Rule also
apply with respect to purchases in client accounts, including "clone
accounts," resulting from "cash flows." To comply with the requirements
of this Rule, it is the responsibility of each portfolio manager or CIO
to be aware of the placement of all orders for purchases of a security
by client accounts that he or she manages for seven days following the
purchase of that security for his or her personal account.

* An investment professional who must sell securities to be in
compliance with the 7-Day Rule must absorb any loss and disgorge to
charity any profit resulting from the sale. The recipient charity will
be chosen by the Code of Ethics Officer.

* This Rule is designed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest between an investment professional and a Putnam client. A
greater burden is placed on these professionals given their positions in
the organization. Transactions executed for the employee's personal
account must be conducted in a manner consistent with the Code of Ethics
and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or perceived conflict of
interest or any abuse of the employee's position of trust and
responsibility.

* "Portfolio manager" is used in this Section as a functional label, and
is intended to cover any employee with authority to authorize a trade on
behalf of a Putnam client, whether or not such employee bears the title
"portfolio manager." "Analyst" is also used in this Section as a
functional label, and is intended to cover any employee who is not a
portfolio manager but who may make recommendations regarding investments
for Putnam clients.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 3: Blackout Rule

(a) Portfolio Managers: No portfolio manager (including a chief
investment officer with respect to an account she manages) shall: (i)
sell any security or related derivative security for her personal
account until seven calendar days have elapsed since the most recent
purchase of that security or related derivative security by any Putnam
client portfolio she manages or comanages; or (ii) purchase any security
or related derivative security for her personal account until seven
calendar days have elapsed since the most recent sale of that security
or related derivative security from any Putnam client portfolio that she
manages or comanages.

(b) Analysts: No analyst shall: (i) sell any security or related
derivative security for his personal account until seven calendar days
have elapsed since his most recent buy recommendation for that security
or related derivative security (including designation of a security for
inclusion in the portfolio of the Putnam Research Fund); or (ii)
purchase any security or related derivative security for his personal
account until seven calendar days have elapsed since his most recent
sell recommendation for that security or related derivative security
(including the removal of a security from the portfolio of the Putnam
Research Fund).


COMMENTS

* This Rule applies to portfolio managers (including chief investment
officers with respect to accounts they manage) in connection with any
purchase (no matter how small) in any client account managed by that
portfolio manager or CIO (even clone accounts). In particular, it should
be noted that the requirements of this rule also apply with respect to
transactions in client accounts, including clone accounts, resulting
from cash flows. In order to comply with the requirements of this Rule,
it is the responsibility of each portfolio manager and CIO to be aware
of all transactions in a security by client accounts that he or she
manages that took place within the seven days preceding a transaction in
that security for his or her personal account.

* This Rule is designed to prevent a Putnam portfolio manager or analyst
from engaging in personal investment conduct that appears to be counter
to the investment strategy she is pursuing or recommending on behalf of
a Putnam client.

* Trades by a Putnam portfolio manager for her personal account in the
"same direction" as the Putnam client portfolio she manages, and trades
by an analyst for his personal account in the same direction as his
recommendation, do not present the same danger, so long as any same
direction trades do not violate other provisions of the Code or the
Policy Statements.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 4: Contra Trading Rule

(a) Portfolio Managers: No portfolio manager shall, without prior
clearance, sell out of his personal account securities or related
derivative securities held in any Putnam client portfolio that he
manages or comanages

(b) Chief Investment Officers: No chief investment officer shall,
without prior clearance, sell out of his personal account securities or
related derivative securities held in any Putnam client portfolio
managed in his investment group.


EXCEPTIONS

None, unless prior clearance and written approval are given.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. Individuals Authorized to Give Approval. Prior to engaging in any
such sale, a portfolio manager shall seek approval, in writing, of the
proposed sale. In the case of a portfolio manager or director, prior
written approval of the proposed sale shall be obtained from a chief
investment officer to whom he reports or, in his absence, another chief
investment officer. In the case of a chief investment officer, prior
written approval of the proposed sale shall be obtained from another
chief investment officer. In addition to the foregoing, prior written
approval must also be obtained from the Code of Ethics Officer.

B. Contents of Written Approval. In every instance, the written approval
form attached as Appendix C (or such other form as the Code of Ethics
Officer shall designate) shall be used. The written approval should be
signed by the chief investment officer giving approval and dated the
date such approval was given, and shall state, briefly, the reasons why
the trade was allowed and why the investment conduct pursued by the
portfolio manager, director, or chief investment officer was deemed
inappropriate for the Putnam client account controlled by the individual
seeking to engage in the transaction for his personal account. Such
written approval shall be sent by the chief investment officer approving
the transaction to the Code of Ethics Officer, for her approval, within
24 hours or as promptly as circumstances permit. Approvals obtained
after a transaction has been completed or while it is in process will
not satisfy the requirements of this Rule.


COMMENT

This Rule, like Rule 3 of this Section, is designed to prevent a Putnam
portfolio manager from engaging in personal investment conduct that
appears to be counter to the investment strategy that he is pursuing on
behalf of a Putnam client.

Rule 5

No portfolio manager shall cause, and no analyst shall recommend, a
Putnam client to take action for the portfolio manager's or analyst's
own personal benefit.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* A portfolio manager who trades in, or an analyst who recommends,
particular securities for a Putnam client account in order to support
the price of securities in his personal account, or who "front runs" a
Putnam client order is in violation of this Rule. Portfolio managers and
analysts should be aware that this Rule is not limited to personal
transactions in securities (as that word is defined in Definitions).
Thus, a portfolio manager or analyst who front runs a Putnam client
purchase or sale of obligations of the U.S. government is in violation
of this Rule, although U.S. government obligations are excluded from the
definition of security.

* This Rule is not limited to instances when a portfolio manager or
analyst has malicious intent. It also prohibits conduct that creates an
appearance of impropriety. Portfolio managers and analysts who have
questions about whether proposed conduct creates an appearance of
impropriety should seek a prior written determination from the Code of
Ethics Officer, using the procedures described in Section VII, Part 3.


SECTION III

General Rules for All Employees

Rule 1: Compliance with All Laws, Regulations and Policies

All employees must comply with applicable laws and regulations as well
as company policies. This includes tax, anti-trust, political
contribution, and international boycott laws. In addition, no employee
at Putnam may engage in fraudulent conduct of any kind.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* Putnam may report to the appropriate legal authorities conduct by
Putnam employees that violates this Rule.

* It should also be noted that the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
makes it a criminal offense to make a payment or offer of payment to any
non-U.S. governmental official, political party, or candidate to induce
that person to affect any governmental act or decision, or to assist
Putnam's obtaining or retaining business.

Rule 2: Conflicts of Interest

No Putnam employee shall conduct herself in a manner, which is contrary
to the interests of, or in competition with, Putnam or a Putnam client,
or which creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest with a
Putnam client.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* This Rule is designed to recognize the fundamental principle that
Putnam employees owe their chief duty and loyalty to Putnam and Putnam
clients.

* It is expected that a Putnam employee who becomes aware of an
investment opportunity that she believes is suitable for a Putnam client
who she services will present it to the appropriate portfolio manager,
prior to taking advantage of the opportunity herself.

Rule 3: Gifts and Entertainment Policy

No Putnam employee shall accept anything of material value from any
broker-dealer, financial institution, corporation or other entity, any
existing or prospective supplier of goods or services with a business
relationship to Putnam, or any company or other entity whose securities
are held in or are being considered as investments for the Putnam funds,
or any other client account. Included are gifts, favors, preferential
treatment, special arrangements, or access to special events.


COMMENTS

This Rule is intended to permit the acceptance of only proper types of
customary and limited business amenities.

A Putnam employee may not, under any circumstances, accept anything that
could create the appearance of any kind of conflict of interest. For
example, acceptance of any consideration is prohibited if it would
create the appearance of a reward or inducement for conducting Putnam
business either with the person providing the gift or his employer.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. Gifts. An employee may not accept small gifts with an aggregate value
of more than $100 in any year from any one source. Any Putnam employee
who is offered or receives an item exceeding $100 in value is prohibited
by this Rule and must report the details to the Code of Ethics Officer.
Any entertainment event provided to an employee where the host is not in
attendance is treated as a gift and is subject to the $100 per year per
source limit.

B. Entertainment. Putnam's rules are designed to permit reasonable,
ordinary business entertainment, but prohibit any events, which may be
perceived as extravagant or involving lavish expenditures.

1. Occasional lunches, dinners, cocktail parties, or comparable
gatherings conducted for business purposes are permitted.

For example, occasional attendance at group functions sponsored by sell
side firms is permitted where the function relates to investments or
other business activity. Occasional attendance at these functions is not
required to be counted against the limits described in paragraph 2(b)
below.

2. Other entertainment events, such as, sporting events, theater,
movies, concerts, or other forms of entertainment conducted for business
purposes, are permitted only under the following conditions:

(i) The host must be present for the event.

(ii) The location of the event must be in the metropolitan area in which
the office of the employee is located.

(iii) Spouses or other family members of the employee may not attend the
entertainment event or any meals before or after the entertainment
event.

(iv) The value of the entertainment event provided to the employee may
not exceed $150, not including the value of any meals that may be
provided to the employee before or after the event.

Acceptance of entertainment events having a market value materially
exceeding the face value of the entertainment including, for example,
attendance at sporting event playoff games, is prohibited. This
prohibition applies even if the face value of tickets to the events is
$150 or less or when the Putnam employee offers to pay for the tickets.
If there is any ambiguity about whether to accept an entertainment event
in these circumstances, please consult the Code of Ethics Officer.

(v) The employee may not accept entertainment events under this
provision (B)(2) more than six times a year and not more than two times
in any year from any single source.

(vi) The Code of Ethics Officer may grant exceptions to these rules. For
example, it may be appropriate for an employee attending a legitimate
conference in a location away from the office to attend a business
entertainment event in that location. All exceptions must be approved in
advance by written request to the Code of Ethics Officer.

3. Any employee attending any entertainment event under (B)(1) or (B)(2)
above must file a Report of Entertainment Form (attached as Appendix E)
with the Code of Ethics Officer within 10 days following the date of the
entertainment event. Failure to file the notice is a violation of the
Code of Ethics.

4. Meals and entertainment, which are part of the regular program at an
investment conference (i.e., open to all participants) are not subject
to the limits of this section (B)(2) above.

C. Among the items that are prohibited are:

1. Any entertainment event attendance, which would reflect badly on
Putnam as a firm of the highest fiduciary and ethical standards. For
example, events involving adult entertainment or gambling must be
avoided.

2. Entertainment involving travel away from the metropolitan area in
which the employee is located. Even in the event an exception is granted
as contemplated by (B)(2)(vi) above, payment by a third party of the
cost of transportation to a location outside the employee's metropolitan
area, lodging while in another location, and any meals not specifically
approved by the Code of Ethics officer, are prohibited;

3. Personal loans to a Putnam employee on terms more favorable than
those generally available for comparable credit standing and collateral;
and

4. Preferential brokerage or underwriting commissions or spreads or
allocations of shares or interests in an investment for the personal
account of a Putnam employee; and

5. Cash or cash equivalents

D. As with any of the provisions of the Code of Ethics, a sincere belief
by the employee that he was acting in accordance with the requirements
of this Rule will not satisfy his obligations under the Rule. Therefore,
an employee who is in doubt concerning the propriety of any gift or
favor should seek a prior written determination from the Code of Ethics
Officer, as provided in number 3 of Section VII.

E. No Putnam employee may solicit any gift or entertainment from any
person, even if the gift or entertainment, if unsolicited, would be
permitted.

F. The Rule does not prohibit employees on business travel from using
local transportation and arrangements customarily supplied by brokers or
similar entities. For example, it is customary for brokers in developing
markets to make local transportation arrangements. These arrangements
are permitted so long as the expense of lodging and air travel are paid
by Putnam.

Rule 4: Anti-bribery/Kickback Policy

No Putnam employee shall pay, offer, or commit to pay any amount of
consideration which might be or appear to be a bribe or kickback in
connection with Putnam's business.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

Although the rule does not specifically address political contributions
(which are described in Rule 5 below), Putnam employees should be aware
that it is against corporate policy to use company assets to fund
political contributions of any sort, even where such contributions may
be legal. No Putnam employee should offer or agree to make any political
contributions (including political dinners and similar fundraisers) on
behalf of Putnam, and no employee will be reimbursed by Putnam for such
contributions made by the employee personally.

Rule 5: Political Contributions/Solicitations Policy

No contributions may be made with corporate funds to any political party
or campaign, whether directly or by reimbursement to an employee for the
expense of such a contribution. No Putnam employee shall solicit any
charitable, political, or other contributions using Putnam letterhead or
making reference to Putnam in the solicitation. No Putnam employee shall
personally solicit any such contribution while on Putnam business.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* Putnam has established a political action committee (PAC) that
contributes to worthy candidates for political office. Any request
received by a Putnam employee for a political contribution must be
directed to Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department.

* This rule prohibits solicitation on personal letterhead by Putnam
employees except as approved by the Code of Ethics Officer.

* Certain officers and employees of Putnam Retail Management and other
employees involved in Putnam's College Advantage Section 529 Plan with
Ohio Tuition Trust Authority are subject to special rules on political
contributions. For questions on these requirements, please call the Code
of Ethics Administrator.

Rule 6: Confidentiality of Putnam Business Information

No unauthorized disclosure may be made by any employee or former
employee of any trade secrets or proprietary information of Putnam or of
any confidential information. No information regarding any Putnam client
portfolio, actual or proposed securities trading activities of any
Putnam client, or Putnam research shall be disclosed outside the Putnam
organization unless doing so has a valid business purpose and is in
accord with any relevant procedures established by Putnam relating to
such disclosures.


COMMENT

All information about Putnam and Putnam clients is strictly
confidential. Putnam research information should not be disclosed
without proper approval and never for personal gain.

Rule 7: Roles At Other Entities

No Putnam employee shall serve as officer, employee, director, trustee,
or general partner of a corporation or entity other than Putnam, without
prior approval of the Code of Ethics Officer. Requests for a role at a
publicly-traded company will be closely reviewed and permission will be
granted on an ad-hoc basis.


EXCEPTION

Charitable or Non-profit Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as officer, director, or trustee of a
charitable or not-for-profit institution, provided that the employee
abides by the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements with respect to
any investment activity for which she has any discretion or input as
officer, director, or trustee. The pre-clearance and reporting
requirements of the Code of Ethics do not apply to the trading
activities of such charitable or not-for-profit institutions for which
an employee serves as an officer, director, or trustee unless the
employee is responsible for day-to-day portfolio management of the
account.


COMMENTS

* This Rule is designed to ensure that Putnam cannot be deemed an
affiliate of any issuer of securities by virtue of service by one of its
officers or employees as director or trustee.

* Positions with public companies are especially problematic and will
normally not be approved.

* Certain charitable or not-for-profit institutions have assets (such as
endowment funds or employee benefit plans) which require prudent
investment. To the extent that a Putnam employee (because of her
position as officer, director, or trustee of an outside entity) is
charged with responsibility to invest such assets prudently, she may not
be able to discharge that duty while simultaneously abiding by the
spirit of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements. Employees are
cautioned that they should not accept service as an officer, director,
or trustee of an outside charitable or not-for-profit entity where such
investment responsibility is involved, without seriously considering
their ability to discharge their fiduciary duties with respect to such
investments.

Rule 8: Role as Trustee or Fiduciary Outside of Putnam

No Putnam employee shall serve as a trustee, executor, custodian, any
other fiduciary, or as an investment advisor or counselor for any
account outside Putnam.


EXCEPTIONS

A. Charitable or Religious Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as fiduciary with respect to a religious or
charitable trust or foundation, so long as the employee abides by the
spirit of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements with respect to
any investment activity over which he has any discretion or input. The
pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code of Ethics do not
apply to the trading activities of such a religious or charitable trust
or foundation unless the employee is responsible for day-to-day
portfolio management of the account.

B. Family Trust or Estate Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as fiduciary with respect to a family trust
or estate, so long as the employee abides by all of the Rules of the
Code of Ethics with respect to any investment activity over which he has
any discretion.


COMMENT

The roles permissible under this Rule may carry with them the obligation
to invest assets prudently. Once again, Putnam employees are cautioned
that they may not be able to fulfill their duties in that respect while
abiding by the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements.

Rule 9: Investment Clubs

No Putnam employee may be a member of any investment club.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

This Rule guards against the danger that a Putnam employee may be in
violation of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements by virtue of
his personal securities transactions in or through an entity that is not
bound by the restrictions imposed by this Code of Ethics and the Policy
Statements. Please note that this restriction also applies to the spouse
of a Putnam employee and any relatives of a Putnam employee living in
the same household as the employee, as their transactions are covered by
the Code of Ethics (see page vii).

Rule 10: Business Negotiations For Putnam

No Putnam employee may become involved in a personal capacity in
consultations or negotiations for corporate financing, acquisitions, or
other transactions for outside companies (whether or not held by any
Putnam client), nor negotiate nor accept a fee in connection with these
activities without obtaining the prior written permission of the
president of Putnam Investments.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 11: Accurate Records

No employee may create, alter or destroy (or participate in the
creation, alteration or destruction of) any record that is intended to
mislead anyone or to conceal anything that is, or is reasonably believed
to be, improper. In addition, all employees responsible for the
preparation, filing, or distribution of any regulatory filings or public
communications must ensure that such filings or communications are
timely, complete, fair, accurate, and understandable.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* In many cases, this is not only a matter of company policy and ethical
behavior but also required by law. Our books and records must accurately
reflect the transactions represented and their true nature. For example,
records must be accurate as to the recipient of all payments; expense
items, including personal expense reports, must accurately reflect the
true nature of the expense. No unrecorded fund or asset shall be
established or maintained for any reason.

* All financial books and records must be prepared and maintained in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Putnam's
existing accounting controls, to the extent applicable.

Rule 12: Interest in Entities Doing Business with Putnam

No employee shall have any direct or indirect (including by a family
member or close relative) personal financial interest (other than normal
investments not material to the employee in the entity's publicly-traded
securities) in any business, with which Putnam has dealings unless such
interest is disclosed and approved by the Code of Ethics Officer.

Rule 13: Affiliated Entities

No employee shall, with respect to any affiliate of Putnam that provides
investment advisory services and is listed below in Comment 4 to this
Rule, as revised from time to time (each a Non-Putnam affiliate or NPA),

(a) Directly or indirectly seek to influence the purchase, retention, or
disposition of, or exercise of voting consent, approval or similar
rights with respect to, any portfolio security in any account or fund
advised by the NPA and not by Putnam,

(b) Transmit any information regarding the purchase, retention or
disposition of, or exercise of voting, consent, approval, or similar
rights with respect to, any portfolio security held in a Putnam or NPA
client account to any personnel of the NPA,

(c) Transmit any trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential
information of Putnam to the NPA unless doing so has a valid business
purpose and is in accord with any relevant procedures established by
Putnam relating to such disclosures,

(d) Use confidential information or trade secrets of the NPA for the
benefit of the employee, Putnam, or any other NPA, or

(e) Breach any duty of loyalty to the NPA derived from the employee's
service as a director or officer of the NPA.


COMMENTS

* Sections (a) and (b) of the Rule are designed to help ensure that the
portfolio holdings of Putnam clients and clients of the NPA need not be
aggregated for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act or applicable regulatory or
contractual investment restrictions that incorporate such definition of
beneficial ownership. Persons who serve as directors or officers of both
Putnam and an NPA should take care to avoid even inadvertent violations
of Section (b). Section (a) does not prohibit a Putnam employee who
serves as a director or officer of the NPA from seeking to influence the
modification or termination of a particular investment product or
strategy in a manner that is not directed at any specific securities.
Sections (a) and (b) do not apply when a Putnam affiliate serves as an
advisor or sub-advisor to the NPA or one of its products, in which case
normal Putnam aggregation rules apply.

* As a separate entity, any NPA may have trade secrets or confidential
information that it would not choose to share with Putnam. This choice
must be respected.

* When Putnam employees serve as directors or officers of an NPA, they
are subject to common law duties of loyalty to the NPA, despite their
Putnam employment. In general, this means that when performing their
duties as NPA directors or officers, they must act in the best interest
of the NPA and its shareholders. Putnam's Legal and Compliance
Department will assist any Putnam employee who is a director or officer
of an NPA and has questions about the scope of his or her
responsibilities to the NPA.

* Entities that are currently non-Putnam affiliates within the scope of
this Rule are: Cisalpina Gestioni, S.p.A., Nissay Asset Management Co.,
Ltd., Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., Ampega Asset Management, GMBH, and
Sceptre Investment Counsel, Ltd.

Rule 14: Computer System/Network Policies

No employee shall use computer hardware, software, data, Internet,
electronic mail, voice mail, electronic messaging (e-mail or cc: Mail),
or telephone communications systems in a manner that is inconsistent
with their use as set forth in policy statements governing their use
that are adopted from time to time by Putnam. No employee shall
introduce a computer virus or computer code that may result in damage to
Putnam's information or computer systems.


COMMENT

Putnam's policy statements relating to these matters are contained in
the Computer System and Network Responsibilities section of the
Employment Issues category within the Employee Handbook. The online
Employee Handbook is located online at www.ibenefitcenter.com under
Policies and Procedures under the @Putnam tab.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 15: AIMR Code of Ethics

All employees must follow and abide by the spirit of the Code of Ethics
and the Standards of Professional Conduct of the Association of
Investment Management and Research (AIMR). The texts of the AIMR Code of
Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct are set forth in Exhibit D.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 16: Privacy Policy

Except as provided below, no employee may disclose to any outside
organization or person any nonpublic personal information about any
individual who is a current or former shareholder of any Putnam retail
or institutional fund, or current or former client of a Putnam company.
All employees shall follow the security procedures as established from
time to time by a Putnam company to protect the confidentiality of all
shareholder and client account information.

Except as Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department may expressly
authorize, no employee shall collect any nonpublic personal information
about a prospective or current shareholder of a Putnam Fund or
prospective or current client of a Putnam company, other than through an
account application (or corresponding information provided by the
shareholder's financial representative) or in connection with executing
shareholder or client transactions, nor shall any information be
collected other than the following: name, address, telephone number,
Social Security number, and investment, broker, and transaction
information.


EXCEPTIONS

A. Putnam Employees. Nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to
Putnam employees in connection with processing transactions or
maintaining accounts for shareholders of a Putnam fund and clients of a
Putnam company, to the extent that access to such information is
necessary to the performance of that employee's job functions.

B. Shareholder Consent Exception. Nonpublic personal information about a
shareholder's or client's account may be provided to a non-Putnam
organization at the specific request of the shareholder or client or
with the shareholder's or client's prior written consent.

C. Broker or Advisor Exception. Nonpublic personal information about a
shareholder's or client's account may be provided to the shareholder's
or client's broker of record.

D. Third-Party Service Provider Exception. Nonpublic personal
information may be disclosed to a service provider that is not
affiliated with a Putnam fund or Putnam company only when such
disclosure is necessary for the service provider to perform the specific
services contracted for, and only (a) if the service provider executes
Putnam's standard confidentiality agreement, or (b) pursuant to an
agreement containing a confidentiality provision that has been approved
by the Legal and Compliance Department. Examples of such service
providers include proxy solicitors and proxy vote tabulators, mail
services, and providers of other administrative services, and
Information Services Division consultants who have access to nonpublic
personal information.


COMMENTS

* Nonpublic personal information is any information that personally
identifies a shareholder of a Putnam fund or client of a Putnam company
and is not derived from publicly available sources. This privacy policy
applies to shareholders or clients who are individuals, not
institutions. However, as a general matter, all information that we
receive about a shareholder of a Putnam fund or client of a Putnam
company shall be treated as confidential. No employee may sell or
otherwise provide shareholder or client lists or any other information
relating to a shareholder or client to any marketing organization.

* All Putnam employees with access to shareholder or client account
information must be trained in and follow Putnam's security procedures
designed to safeguard that information from unauthorized use. For
example, a telephone representative must be trained in and follow
Putnam's security procedures to verify the identity of a caller
requesting account information.

* Any questions regarding this privacy policy should be directed to
Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department. A violation of this policy
will be subject to the sanctions imposed for violations of Putnam's Code
of Ethics.

* Employees must report any violation of this policy or any possible
breach of the confidentiality of client information (whether intentional
or accidental) to the managing director in charge of the employee's
business unit. Managing directors who are notified of such a violation
or possible breach must immediately report it in writing to Putnam's
chief compliance officer and, in the event of a breach of computerized
data, Putnam's chief technology officer.

Rule 17: Anti-money Laundering Policy

No employee may engage in any money laundering activity or facilitate
any money-laundering activity through the use of any Putnam account or
client account. Any situations giving rise to a suspicion that attempted
money laundering may be occurring in any account must be reported
immediately to the managing director in charge of the employee's
business unit. Managing directors who are notified of such a suspicion
of money laundering activity must immediately report it in writing to
Putnam's chief compliance officer and chief financial officer.

Rule 18: Record Retention

All employees must comply with the record retention requirements
applicable to the business unit. Employees should check with their
managers or the chief administrative officer of their division to
determine what record retention requirements apply to their business
unit.


SECTION IV

Special Rules for Officers and Employees of Putnam Investments Limited

Rule 1

In situations subject to Section I.A., Rule 1 (Restricted List Personal
Securities Transactions, the Putnam Investments Limited (PIL) employee
must obtain clearance not only as provided in that rule, but also from
PIL's Compliance Officer or her designee, who must approve the
transaction before any trade is placed and record the approval.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

Putnam's Code of Ethics Administrator in Boston (the Boston
Administrator) has also been designated the Assistant Compliance Officer
of PIL and has been delegated the right to approve or disapprove
personal securities transactions in accordance with the requirements of
Section I.A. Therefore, approval from the Code of Ethics Administrator
for PIL employees to make personal securities investments constitutes
approval under the Code of Ethics and also for purposes of compliance
with the Financial Services Authority, the U.K. self-regulatory
organization that regulates PIL.

The position of London Code of Ethics Administrator (the London
Administrator) has also been created (Jane Barlow is the current London
Administrator). All requests for clearances must be made by e-mail to
the Boston Administrator copying the London Administrator. The e-mail
must include the number of shares to be bought or sold and the name of
the broker(s) involved. Where time is of the essence clearances may be
made by telephone to the Boston Administrator but they must be followed
up by e-mail.

Both the Boston and London Administrators will maintain copies of all
clearances for inspection by senior management and regulators.

Rule 2

No PIL employee may trade with any broker or dealer unless that broker
or dealer has sent a letter to the London Administrator agreeing to
deliver copies of trade confirmations and statements to PIL. No PIL
employee may enter into any margin or any other special dealing
arrangement with any broker-dealer without the prior written consent of
the PIL compliance officer.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

PIL employees will be notified separately of this requirement once a
year by the PIL compliance officer, and are required to provide an
annual certification of compliance with the Rule.

All PIL employees must inform the London Administrator of the names of
all brokers and dealers with whom they trade prior to trading. The
London Administrator will send a letter to the broker(s) in question
requesting them to agree to deliver copies of confirms to PIL. The
London Administrator will forward copies of the confirms to the Boston
Administrator. PIL employees may trade with a broker only when the
London Administrator has received the signed agreement from that broker.

Rule 3

For purposes of the Code of Ethics, including Putnam's Policy Statement
on Insider Trading Prohibitions, PIL employees must also comply with
Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on insider dealing.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

To ensure compliance with UK insider dealing legislation, PIL employees
must observe the relevant procedures set forth in PIL's Compliance
Manual, a copy of which is sent to each PIL employee, and sign an annual
certification as to compliance.


SECTION V

Reporting Requirements for All Employees

Reporting of Personal Securities Transactions

Rule 1

Each Putnam employee shall ensure that copies of all confirmations for
securities transactions for his personal brokerage accounts, and,
beginning in the fourth quarter 2004, brokerage account statements are
sent to the Putnam Compliance Department's (Code of Ethics
Administrator). (For the purpose of this Rule, securities shall also
include ETFs, futures, and other derivatives on broad-based market
indexes excluded from the pre-clearance requirement.) Statements and
confirmations are required for Putnam funds not held at PPA or in a
Putnam retirement plan, as well as for U.S. mutual funds sub-advised by
Putnam.


EXCEPTION

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. Putnam employees must instruct their broker-dealers to send
statements and confirmations to Putnam and must follow up with the
broker-dealer on a reasonable basis to ensure that the instructions are
being followed. For brokerage accounts, Putnam employees should contact
the Code of Ethics Administrator to obtain a letter from Putnam
authorizing the setting up of a personal brokerage account.

B. Statements and confirmations should be submitted to the Code of
Ethics Administrator.

C. Specific procedures apply to employees of PIL. Employees of PIL
should contact the London Code of Ethics Administrator.

D. Failure of a broker-dealer to comply with the instructions of a
Putnam employee to send confirmations shall be a violation by the Putnam
employee of this Rule. Similarly, failure by an employee to report the
existence of a personal account (and, if the account is opened after
joining Putnam, failure to obtain proper authorization to establish the
account) shall be a violation of this Rule.

E. Statements and confirmations must also be sent for members of an
employees' immediate family, including statements received with respect
to a family member's 401(k) plan at another employer.


COMMENTS

* Transactions for personal accounts is defined broadly to include more
than transaction in accounts under an employee's own name. See
Definitions.

* Statements and confirmations are required for all personal securities
transactions, whether or not exempted or excepted by this Code.

* To the extent that a Putnam employee has investment authority over
securities transactions of a family trust or estate, confirmations of
those transactions must also be made, unless the employee has received a
prior written exception from the Code of Ethics Officer.

Rule 2

Every Access Person shall file a quarterly report, within ten calendar
days of the end of each quarter, recording all purchases and sales of
any securities for personal accounts as defined in the Definitions. (For
the purpose of this Rule, "securities" shall include exchange traded
funds (ETF), futures, and any option on a security or securities index,
including broad-based market indexes excluded from the pre-clearance
requirement and also includes transactions in Putnam open-end funds if
the account for the Putnam funds is not held at PPA or in a Putnam
retirement plan and for transactions in U.S. mutual funds sub-advised by
Putnam.)


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

All employees required to file such a report will receive by e-mail a
blank form at the end of the quarter from the Code of Ethics
Administrator. The form will specify the information to be reported. The
form shall also contain a representation that employees have complied
fully with all provisions of the Code of Ethics.


COMMENTS

* The date for each transaction required to be disclosed in the
quarterly report is the trade date for the transaction, not the
settlement date.

* If the requirement to file a quarterly report applies to you and you
fail to report within the required 10-day period, salary increases and
bonuses will be reduced in accordance with guidelines stated in the
form. It is the responsibility of the employee to request an early
report if he has knowledge of a planned absence, i.e., vacation or
business trip.

Reporting of Personal Securities Holdings

Rule 3

Access Persons must disclose all personal securities holdings to the
Code of Ethics Officer upon commencement of employment within ten
calendar days of hire and thereafter on an annual basis. This
requirement is mandated by SEC regulations and is designed to facilitate
the monitoring of personal securities transactions. Putnam's Code of
Ethics Administrator will provide Access Persons with the form for
making these reports and the specific information that must be disclosed
at the time that the disclosure is required.

Reporting Irregular Activity

Rule 4

If a Putnam employee suspects that fraudulent, illegal, or other
irregular activity (including violations of the Code of Ethics) might be
occurring at Putnam, the activity should be reported immediately to the
managing director in charge of that employee's business unit. Managing
directors who are notified of any such activity must immediately report
it in writing to Putnam's financial officer and Putnam's Chief
Compliance Officer.

An employee who does not feel comfortable reporting this activity to the
relevant managing director may instead contact the chief compliance
officer, the Putnam or MMC Ethics hotlines or the ombudsman.

Rule 5

Putnam has established a formal Office of the Ombudsman as an additional
mechanism for an employee to report an impropriety or conduct that is
not in line with the company's value system. The ombudsman is a person
who is authorized to receive complaints or questions confidentially
about alleged acts, omissions, improprieties, and broader systemic
problems within the organization. Communication with the Ombudsman is
confidential.


SECTION VI

Education Requirements

Every Putnam employee has an obligation to fully understand the
requirements of the Code of Ethics. The Rules set forth below are
designed to enhance this understanding.

Rule 1

A copy of the Code of Ethics will be distributed to every Putnam
employee periodically. All Access Persons will be required to certify
annually that they have read, understood, and will comply with the
provisions of the Code of Ethics, including the Code's Policy Statement
Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions.

Rule 2

Every employee will annually be required to complete training on
Putnam's Code of Ethics.


SECTION VII

Compliance and Appeal Procedures

A. Assembly of Restricted List

The Code of Ethics Administrator will coordinate the assembly and
maintenance of the Restricted List. The list will be assembled each day
by 11:30 a.m. No employee may engage in a personal securities
transaction without prior clearance on any day, even if the employee
believes that the trade will be subject to an exception. Note that
pre-clearance may be obtained after 9:00 a.m. for purchases or sales of
up to 1,000 shares of issuers having a market capitalization in excess
of $5 billion.

B. Consultation of Restricted List

It is the responsibility of each employee to pre-clear through the
pre-clearance system or consult with the Code of Ethics Administrator
prior to engaging in a personal securities transaction, to determine if
the security he proposes to trade is on the Restricted List and, if so,
whether it is subject to the large-cap exception. The pre-clearance
system and the Code of Ethics Administrator will be able to tell an
employee whether a security is on the Restricted List. No other
information about the Restricted List is available through the
pre-clearance system. The Code of Ethics Administrator shall not be
authorized to answer any questions about the Restricted List, or to
render an opinion about the propriety of a particular personal
securities transaction. Any such questions shall be directed to the Code
of Ethics Officer.

C. Request for Determination

An employee who has a question concerning the applicability of the Code
of Ethics to a particular situation shall request a determination from
the Code of Ethics Officer before engaging in the conduct or personal
securities transaction about which he has a question.

If the question pertains to a personal securities transaction, the
request shall state for whose account the transaction is proposed, the
relationship of that account to the employee, the security proposed to
be traded, the proposed price and quantity, the entity with whom the
transaction will take place (if known), and any other information or
circumstances of the trade that could have a bearing on the Code of
Ethics Officer's determination. If the question pertains to other
conduct, the request for determination shall give sufficient information
about the proposed conduct to assist the Code of Ethics Officer in
ascertaining the applicability of the Code. In every instance, the Code
of Ethics Officer may request additional information, and may decline to
render a determination if the information provided is insufficient.

The Code of Ethics Officer shall make every effort to render a
determination promptly.

No perceived ambiguity in the Code of Ethics shall excuse any violation.
Any person who believes the Code to be ambiguous in a particular
situation shall request a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer.

D. Request for Ad Hoc Exemption

Any employee who wishes to obtain an ad hoc exemption under Section
I.D., Rule 2, shall request from the Code of Ethics Officer an exemption
in writing in advance of the conduct or transaction sought to be
exempted. In the case of a personal securities transaction, the request
for an ad hoc exemption shall give the same information about the
transaction required in a request for determination under number 3 of
this section, and shall state why the proposed personal securities
transaction would be unlikely to affect a highly institutional market,
or is unrelated economically to securities to be purchased, sold, or
held by any Putnam client. In the case of other conduct, the request
shall give information sufficient for the Code of Ethics Officer to
ascertain whether the conduct raises questions of propriety or conflict
of interest (real or apparent).

The Code of Ethics Officer shall make reasonable efforts to promptly
render a written determination concerning the request for an ad hoc
exemption.

E. Appeal to Code of Ethics Officer with Respect to Restricted List

If an employee ascertains that a security that he wishes to trade for
his personal account appears on the Restricted List, and thus the
transaction is prohibited, he may appeal the prohibition to the Code of
Ethics Officer by submitting a written memorandum containing the same
information as would be required in a request for a determination. The
Code of Ethics Officer shall make every effort to respond to the appeal
promptly.

F. Information Concerning Identity of Compliance Personnel

The names of Code of Ethics personnel are available by contacting the
Legal and Compliance Department and will be published on Putnam's Web
site.

APPENDIX A: Policy Statement Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions


PREAMBLE

Putnam has always forbidden trading on material nonpublic information
(inside information) by its employees. Tough federal laws make it
important for Putnam to state that prohibition in the strongest possible
terms, and to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.

Unlawful trading while in possession of inside information can be a
crime. Federal law provides that an individual convicted of trading on
inside information may go to jail for a period of time. There is also
significant monetary liability for an inside trader; the Securities and
Exchange Commission can seek a court order requiring a violator to pay
back profits, as well as penalties substantially greater than those
profits. In addition private plaintiffs can seek recovery for harm
suffered by them. The inside trader is not the only one subject to
liability. In certain cases, controlling persons of inside traders
(including supervisors of inside traders or Putnam itself ) can be
liable for large penalties.

Section 1 of this Policy Statement contains rules concerning inside
information. Section 2 contains a discussion of what constitutes
unlawful insider trading.

Neither material nonpublic information nor unlawful insider trading is
easy to define. Section 2 of this Policy Statement gives a general
overview of the law in this area. However, the legal issues are complex
and must be resolved by the Code of Ethics Officer. If an employee has
any doubt as to whether she has received material nonpublic information,
she must consult with the Code of Ethics Officer prior to using that
information in connection with the purchase or sale of a security for
his own account or the account of any Putnam client, or communicating
the information to others. A simple rule of thumb is if you think the
information is not available to the public at large, don't disclose it
to others and don't trade securities to which the inside information
relates. An employee aware of or in possession of inside information
must report it immediately to the Code of Ethics Officer. If an employee
has failed to consult the Code of Ethics Officer, Putnam will not excuse
employee misuse of inside information on the ground that the employee
claims to have been confused about this Policy Statement or the nature
of the information in his possession.

If Putnam determines, in its sole discretion, that an employee has
failed to abide by this Policy Statement, or has engaged in conduct that
raises a significant question concerning insider trading, he will be
subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

There are no exceptions to this policy statement and no one is exempt.

significantly from that in the Code of Ethics. For example, the
definition in this Policy Statement specifically includes all securities
of any type.)

for any account other than a Putnam client account which receives
investment advice of any sort from the employee or immediate family
member, or as to which the employee or immediate family member has
investment discretion. Officers and employees of PIL must also consult
the relevant procedures on compliance with U.K. insider dealing
legislation set forth in PIL's Compliance Manual (See Rule 3 of Section
IV of the Code of Ethics).


APPENDIX A

SECTION I: Rules Concerning Inside Information

Rule 1

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security listed on the
Inside Information List (the Red List) either for his personal account
or for a Putnam client.


IMPLEMENTATION

When an employee contacts the Code of Ethics Administrator seeking
clearance for a personal securities transaction, the Code of Ethics
Administrator's response as to whether a security appears on the
Restricted List will include securities on the Red List.


COMMENT

This Rule is designed to prohibit any employee from trading a security
while Putnam may have inside information concerning that security or the
issuer. Every trade, whether for a personal account or for a Putnam
client, is subject to this Rule.

Rule 2

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security, either for a
personal account or for the account of a Putnam client, while in
possession of material, nonpublic information concerning that security
or the issuer, without the prior written approval of the Code of Ethics
Officer.


IMPLEMENTATION

In order to obtain prior written approval of the Code of Ethics Officer,
a Putnam employee should follow the reporting steps prescribed in Rule 3.

COMMENTS

* Rule 1 concerns the conduct of an employee when Putnam possesses
material nonpublic information. Rule 2 concerns the conduct of an
employee who herself possesses material, nonpublic information about a
security that is not yet on the Red List.

* If an employee has any question as to whether information she
possesses is material and/or nonpublic information, she must contact the
Code of Ethics Officer in accordance with Rule 3 prior to purchasing or
selling any security related to the information or communicating the
information to others. The Code of Ethics Officer shall have the sole
authority to determine what constitutes material, nonpublic information
for the purposes of this Policy Statement.

Rule 3

Any Putnam employee who believes he may have received material,
nonpublic information concerning a security or the issuer shall
immediately report the information to the Code of Ethics Officer, the
Deputy Code of Ethics Officer or, in their absence, the general counsel
and to no one else. After reporting the information, the Putnam employee
shall comply strictly with Rule 2 by not trading in the security without
the prior written approval of the Code of Ethics Officer and shall: (a)
take precautions to ensure the continued confidentiality of the
information; and (b) refrain from communicating the information in
question to any person.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. In order to make any use of potential material, nonpublic
information, including purchasing or selling a security or communicating
the information to others, an employee must communicate that information
to the Code of Ethics Officer in a way designed to prevent the spread of
such information. Once the employee has reported potential material,
nonpublic information to the Code of Ethics Officer, the Code of Ethics
Officer will evaluate whether information constitutes material,
nonpublic information, and whether a duty exists that makes use of such
information improper. If the Code of Ethics Officer determines either
(a) that the information is not material or is public, or (b) that use
of the information is proper, he will issue a written approval to the
employee specifically authorizing trading while in possession of the
information, if the employee so requests. If the Code of Ethics Officer
determines (a) that the information may be nonpublic and material, and
(b) that use of such information may be improper, he will place the
security that is the subject of such information on the Red List.

B. An employee who reports potential inside information to the Code of
Ethics Officer should expect that the Code of Ethics Officer will need
significant information (and time to gather such information) to make
the evaluation described in the foregoing paragraph, including
information about (a) the manner in which the employee acquired the
information, and (b) the identity of individuals to whom the employee
has revealed the information, or who have otherwise learned the
information. In appropriate situations, the Code of Ethics Officer shall
place the affected security or securities on the Red List pending the
completion of his evaluation.

C. If an employee possesses documents, disks, or other materials
containing the potential inside information, an employee must take
precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the information in
question. Those precautions include (a) putting documents containing
such information out of the view of a casual observer, and (b) securing
files containing such documents or ensuring that computer files
reflecting such information are secure from viewing by others.

D. Members of the executive board of directors and members of chief
financial officer's staff may not trade securities of MMC in the period
from the end of each calendar quarter to the date of announcement of
MMC's earnings for such quarter.


COMMENTS

While all employees must pre-clear trades of MMC securities and make
sure they are not in possession of material inside information about MMC
when trading, certain employees who may receive information about
Putnam's earnings are subject to the rules above concerning trading
black out periods.


APPENDIX A

SECTION II: Overview of Insider Trading

Introduction

This section of the Policy Statement provides guidelines for employees
as to what may constitute inside information. It is possible that in the
course of her employment, an employee may receive inside information. No
employee should misuse that information, either by trading for her own
account or by communicating the information to others.

What constitutes unlawful insider trading?

The basic definition of unlawful insider trading is trading on material,
nonpublic information (also called inside information) by an individual
who has a duty not to take advantage of the information. The following
sections help explain the definition.

What is material information?

Trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the
information is material. Information is material if a reasonable person
would attach importance to the information in determining his course of
action with respect to a security. Information that is reasonably likely
to affect the price of a company's securities is material, but effect on
price is not the sole criterion for determining materiality. Information
that employees should consider material includes but is not limited to:
dividend changes, earnings estimates, changes in previously released
earnings estimates, reorganization, recapitalization, asset sales, plans
to commence a tender offer, merger or acquisition proposals or
agreements, major litigation, liquidity problems, significant contracts,
and extraordinary management developments.

Material information does not have to relate to a company's business.
For example, a court considered as material certain information about
the contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that was expected to
affect the market price of a security. In that case, a reporter for The
Wall Street Journal was found criminally liable for disclosing to others
the dates that reports on various companies would appear in the
Journal's "Heard on the Street" column and whether those reports would
be favorable or not.

What is nonpublic information?

Information is nonpublic until it has been effectively communicated to,
and sufficient opportunity has existed for it to be absorbed by, the
marketplace. One must be able to point to some fact to show that the
information is generally public. For example, information found in a
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or appearing
in Dow Jones, Reuters Economic Services, The Wall Street Journal, or
other publications of general circulation would be considered public.

Who has a duty not to "take advantage" of inside information?

Unlawful insider trading occurs only if there is a duty not to take
advantage of material nonpublic information. When there is no such duty,
it is permissible to trade while in possession of such information.
Questions as to whether a duty exists are complex, fact-specific, and
must be answered by a lawyer.

Insiders and Temporary Insiders

Corporate insiders have a duty not to take advantage of inside
information. The concept of insider is broad. It includes officers,
directors, and employees of a corporation. In addition, a person can be
a temporary insider if she enters into a special confidential
relationship with a corporation and as a result is given access to
information concerning the corporation's affairs. A temporary insider
can include, among others, accounting firms, consulting firms, law
firms, banks, and the employees of such organizations. Putnam would
generally be a temporary insider of a corporation it advises or for
which it performs other services, because typically Putnam clients
expect Putnam to keep any information disclosed to it confidential.


EXAMPLE

An investment advisor to the pension fund of a large publicly-traded
corporation, Acme, Inc., learns from an Acme employee that Acme will not
be making the minimum required annual contribution to the pension fund
because of a serious downturn in Acme's financial situation. The
information conveyed is material and nonpublic.


COMMENT

Neither the investment advisor or its employees, nor its clients can
trade on the basis of that information, because the investment advisor
and its employees could be considered "temporary insiders" of Acme.

Misappropriators

Certain people who are not insiders (or temporary insiders) also have a
duty not to deceptively take advantage of inside information. Included
in this category is an individual who misappropriates (or takes for his
own use) material, nonpublic information in violation of a duty owed
either to the corporation that is the subject of inside information or
some other entity. Such a misappropriator can be held liable if he
trades while in possession of that material, nonpublic information.


EXAMPLE

The Chief Investment Officer of Acme, Inc., is aware of Acme's plans to
engage in a hostile takeover of Profit, Inc. The proposed hostile
takeover is material and nonpublic.


COMMENT

The Chief Investment Officer of Acme cannot trade in Profit, Inc.'s
stock for his own account. Even though he owes no duty to Profit, Inc.,
or its shareholders, he owes a duty to Acme not to take advantage of the
information about the proposed hostile takeover by using it for his
personal benefit.

Tippers and Tippees

A person (the tippee) who receives material, nonpublic information from
an insider or misappropriator (the tipper) has a duty not to trade while
in possession of that information if he knew or should have known that
the information was provided by the tipper for an improper purpose and
in breach of a duty owed by the tipper. In this context, it is an
improper purpose for a person to provide such information for personal
benefit, such as money, affection, or friendship.


EXAMPLE

The Chief Executive Officer of Acme, Inc., tells his daughter that
negotiations concerning a previously announced acquisition of Acme have
been terminated. This news is material and, at the time the father tells
his daughter, nonpublic. The daughter sells her shares of Acme.


COMMENT

The father is a tipper because he has a duty to Acme and its
shareholders not to take advantage of the information concerning the
breakdown of negotiations, and he has conveyed the information for an
improper purpose (here, out of love and affection for his daughter). The
daughter is a tippee and is liable for trading on inside information
because she knew or should have known that her father was conveying the
information to her for his personal benefit, and that her father had a
duty not to take advantage of Acme information.

A person can be a tippee even if he did not learn the information
directly from the tipper, but learned it from a previous tippee.


EXAMPLE

An employee of a law firm which works on mergers and acquisitions learns
at work about impending acquisitions. She tells her friend and her
friend's stockbroker about the upcoming acquisitions on a regular basis.
The stockbroker tells the brother of a client on a regular basis, who in
turn tells two friends, A and B. A and B buy shares of the companies
being acquired before public announcement of the acquisition, and
regularly profit from such purchases. A and B do not know the employee
of the law firm. They do not, however, ask about the source of the
information.


COMMENT

A and B, although they have never heard of the tipper, are tippees
because they did not ask about the source of the information, even
though they were experienced investors, and were aware that the "tips"
they received from this particular source were always right.

Who can be liable for insider trading?

The categories of individuals discussed above (insiders, temporary
insiders, misappropriators, or tippees) can be liable if they trade
while in possession of material nonpublic information.

In addition, individuals other than those who actually trade on inside
information can be liable for trades of others. A tipper can be liable
if (a) he provided the information in exchange for a personal benefit in
breach of a duty, and (b) the recipient of the information (the tippee)
traded while in possession of the information.

Most importantly, a controlling person can be liable if the controlling
person knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the controlled
person was likely to engage in misuse of inside information and failed
to take appropriate steps to prevent it. Putnam is a controlling person
of its employees. In addition, certain supervisors may be controlling
persons of those employees they supervise.


EXAMPLE

A supervisor of an analyst learns that the analyst has, over a long
period of time, secretly received material inside information from Acme,
Inc.'s Chief Investment Officer. The supervisor learns that the analyst
has engaged in a number of trades for his personal account on the basis
of the inside information. The supervisor takes no action.


COMMENT

Even if he is not liable to a private plaintiff, the supervisor can be
liable to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a civil penalty of
up to three times the amount of the analyst's profit. (Penalties are
discussed in the following section.)

Penalties for insider trading

Penalties for misuse of inside information are severe, both for
individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers. A
person who violates the insider trading laws can be subject to some or
all of the types penalties below, even if he does not personally benefit
from the violation. Penalties include:

* Jail sentences, criminal monetary penalties.

* Injunctions permanently preventing an individual from working in the
securities industry.

* Injunctions ordering an individual to pay over profits obtained from
unlawful insider trading.

* Civil penalties substantially greater than the profit gained or loss
avoided by the trader, even if the individual paying the penalty did not
trade or did not benefit personally.

* Civil penalties for the employer or other controlling person.

* Damages in the amount of actual losses suffered by other participants
in the market for the security at issue.

Regardless of whether penalties or money damages are sought by others,
Putnam will take whatever action it deems appropriate (including
dismissal) if Putnam determines, in its sole discretion, that an
employee appears to have committed any violation of this Policy
Statement, or to have engaged in any conduct which raises significant
questions about whether an insider trading violation has occurred.


APPENDIX B: Policy Statement Regarding Employee Trades in Shares of
Putnam Closed-End Funds

Pre-clearance for all employees

Any purchase or sale of Putnam closed-end fund shares by a Putnam
employee must be pre-cleared by the Code of Ethics Officer or, in his
absence, the Deputy Code of Ethics Officer. A list of the closed-end
funds can be obtained from the Code of Ethics Administrator. The
automated pre-clearance system is not available for Putnam closed-end
fund clearance. Trading in shares of closed-end funds is subject to all
the rules of the Code of Ethics. Contact the Code of Ethics
Administrator with these pre-clearance requests.

Special Rules Applicable to Managing Directors of Putnam Investment
Management, LLC and officers of the Putnam Funds.

Please be aware that any employee who is a managing director of Putnam
Investment Management, Inc. (the investment manager of the Putnam mutual
funds) and officers of the Putnam Funds will not receive clearance to
engage in any combination of purchase and sale or sale and purchase of
the shares of a given closed-end fund within six months of each other.
Therefore, purchases should be made only if you intend to hold the
shares more than six months; no sales of fund shares should be made if
you intend to purchase additional shares of that same fund within six
months.

You are also required to file certain forms with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with purchases and sales of Putnam
closed-end funds. Please contact the Code of Ethics Officer
Administrator for further information.

Reporting by all employees

As with any purchase or sale of a security, duplicate confirmations of
all such purchases and sales must be forwarded to the Code of Ethics
Officer by the broker-dealer utilized by an employee. If you are
required to file a quarterly report of all personal securities
transactions, this report should include all purchases and sales of
closed-end fund shares.

Please contact the Code of Ethics Officer or Deputy Code of Ethics
Officer if there are any questions regarding these matters.

* Relationships with and responsibilities to clients and prospects
* Relationships with and responsibilities to the public
* Standards of Practice Handbook

Fundamental Responsibilities

Members shall maintain knowledge of and comply with all applicable laws,
rules, and regulations (including AIMR's Code of Ethics and Standards of
Professional Conduct) of any government, governmental agency, regulatory
organization, licensing agency, or professional association governing
the members' professional activities. Not knowingly participate in or
assist any violation of such laws, rules, or regulations.

Relationships with and Responsibilities to the Profession

Use of Professional Designation

AIMR members may reference their membership only in a dignified and
judicious manner. The use of the reference may be accompanied by an
accurate explanation of the requirements that have been met to obtain
membership in these organizations.

Those who have earned the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst
designation may use the marks "Chartered Financial Analyst" or "CFA" and
are encouraged to do so, but only in a proper, dignified, and judicious
manner. The use of the designation may be accompanied by an accurate
explanation of the requirements that have been met to obtain the right
to use the designation.

Candidates in the CFA Program, as defined in the AIMR Bylaws, may
reference their participation in the CFA Program, but the reference must
clearly state that an individual is a candidate in the CFA Program and
cannot imply that the candidate has achieved any type of partial
designation.

Professional Misconduct

Members shall not engage in any professional conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation or commit any act that
reflects adversely on their honesty, trustworthiness, or professional
competence.

Members and candidates shall not engage in any conduct or commit any act
that compromises the integrity of the CFA designation or the integrity
or validity of the examinations leading to the award of the right to use
the CFA designation.

Prohibition against Plagiarism

Members shall not copy or use, in substantially the same form as the
original, material prepared by another without acknowledging and
identifying the name of the author, publisher, or source of such
material. Members may use, without acknowledgment, factual information
published by recognized financial and statistical reporting services or
similar sources.

Relationships with and Responsibilities to the Employer

Obligation to Inform Employer of Code and Standards

Members shall inform their employer in writing, through their direct
supervisor, that they are obligated to comply with the Code and
Standards and are subject to disciplinary sanctions for violations
thereof.

Members shall deliver a copy of the Code and Standards to their employer
if the employer does not have a copy.

Duty to Employer

Members shall not undertake any independent practice that could result
in compensation or other benefit in competition with their employer
unless they obtain written consent from both their employer and the
persons or entities for whom they undertake independent practice.

Disclosure of Conflicts to Employer

Members shall comply with any prohibitions on activities imposed by
their employer if a conflict of interest exists.

Disclosure of Additional Compensation Arrangements

Members shall disclose to their employer in writing all monetary
compensation or other benefits that they receive for their services that
are in addition to compensation or benefits conferred by a member's
employer.

Responsibilities of Supervisors

Members with supervisory responsibility, authority, or the ability to
influence the conduct of others shall exercise reasonable supervision
over those subject to their supervision or authority to prevent any
violation of applicable statutes, regulations, or provisions of the Code
and Standards. In so doing, members are entitled to rely on reasonable
procedures to detect and prevent such violations.

Relationships with and Responsibilities to Clients and Prospects

Investment Process

REASONABLE BASIS AND REPRESENTATIONS

* Exercise diligence and thoroughness in making investment
recommendations or in taking investment actions.

* Have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by appropriate
research and investigation, for such recommendations or actions.

* Make reasonable and diligent efforts to avoid any material
misrepresentation in any research report or investment recommendation.

* Maintain appropriate records to support the reasonableness of such
recommendations or actions.


RESEARCH REPORTS


* Use reasonable judgment regarding the inclusion or exclusion of
relevant factors in research reports.

* Distinguish between facts and opinions in research reports.

* Indicate the basic characteristics of the investment involved when
preparing for public distribution a research report that is not directly
related to a specific portfolio or client.


INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY

* Members shall use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain
independence and objectivity in making investment recommendations or
taking investment action.

Interactions with Clients and Prospects

FIDUCIARY DUTIES

In relationships with clients, members shall use particular care in
determining applicable fiduciary duty and shall comply with such duty as
to those persons and interests to whom the duty is owed. Members must
act for the benefit of their clients and place their clients' interests
before their own.


PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS

Members shall:

* Make a reasonable inquiry into a client's financial situation,
investment experience, and investment objectives prior to making any
investment recommendations and shall update this information as
necessary, but no less frequently than annually, to allow the members to
adjust their investment recommendations to reflect changed
circumstances.

* Consider the appropriateness and suitability of investment
recommendations or actions for each portfolio or client. In determining
appropriateness and suitability, members shall consider applicable
relevant factors, including the needs and circumstances of the portfolio
or client, the basic characteristics of the investment involved, and the
basic characteristics of the total portfolio.

* Members shall not make a recommendation unless they reasonably
determine that the recommendation is suitable to the client's financial
situation, investment experience, and investment objectives.

* Distinguish between facts and opinions in the presentation of
investment recommendations.

* Disclose to clients and prospects the basic format and general
principles of the investment processes by which securities are selected
and portfolios are constructed and shall promptly disclose to clients
and prospects any changes that might significantly affect those
processes.

FAIR DEALING

Members shall deal fairly and objectively with all clients and prospects
when disseminating investment recommendations, disseminating material
changes in prior investment recommendations, and taking investment
action.


PRIORITY OF TRANSACTIONS

Transactions for clients and employers shall have priority over
transactions in securities or other investments of which a member is the
beneficial owner so that such personal transactions do not operate
adversely to their clients' or employer's interests. If members make a
recommendation regarding the purchase or sale of a security or other
investment, they shall give their clients and employer adequate
opportunity to act on their recommendations before acting on their own
behalf. For purposes of the Code and Standards, a member is a
"beneficial owner" if the member has:

* direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the securities;

* the power to vote or direct the voting of the shares of the securities
or investments;

* the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security or
investment.


PRESERVATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY

Members shall preserve the confidentiality of information communicated
by clients, prospects, or employers concerning matters within the scope
of the client-member, prospect-member, or employer-member relationship
unless a member receives information concerning illegal activities on
the part of the client, prospect, or employer.


PROHIBITION AGAINST MISREPRESENTATION


Members shall not make any statements, orally or in writing, that
misrepresent

* the services that they or their firms are capable of performing;

* their qualifications or the qualifications of their firm;

* the member's academic or professional credentials.

Members shall not make or imply, orally or in writing, any assurances or
guarantees regarding any investment except to communicate accurate
information regarding the terms of the investment instrument and the
issuer's obligations under the instrument.


DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS TO CLIENTS AND PROSPECTS

Members shall disclose to their clients and prospects all matters,
including beneficial ownership of securities or other investments, that
reasonably could be expected to impair the members' ability to make
unbiased and objective recommendations.


DISCLOSURE OF REFERRAL FEES

Members shall disclose to clients and prospects any consideration or
benefit received by the member or delivered to others for the
recommendation of any services to the client or prospect.

Relationships with and Responsibilities to the Public

PROHIBITION AGAINST USE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION

Members who possess material nonpublic information related to the value
of a security shall not trade or cause others to trade in that security
if such trading would breach a duty or if the information was
misappropriated or relates to a tender offer. If members receive
material nonpublic information in confidence, they shall not breach that
confidence by trading or causing others to trade in securities to which
such information relates. Members shall make reasonable efforts to
achieve public dissemination of material nonpublic information disclosed
in breach of a duty.


PERFORMANCE PRESENTATION

Members shall not make any statements, orally or in writing, that
misrepresent the investment performance that they or their firms have
accomplished or can reasonably be expected to achieve. If members
communicate individual or firm performance information directly or
indirectly to clients or prospective clients, or in a manner intended to
be received by clients or prospective clients, members shall make every
reasonable effort to assure that such performance information is a fair,
accurate, and complete presentation of such performance.

Supplement - dated December 15, 2004 to Putnam Code of Ethics

The Putnam Code of Ethics Oversight Committee has approved the following
amendments to the August 2004 Code of Ethics.

Sanctions Guidelines

The Sanctions Guidelines in Section 1A of the Code (page 4 of August
Code) have been withdrawn and are replaced with the following new
Sanctions Guidelines effective with the first quarter of  2005:

"The Code of Ethics Oversight Committee is responsible for setting
sanctions policies for violating the Code. The Committee has adopted the
following minimum monetary sanctions for violations of the Code.  These
sanctions apply even if the exception results from inadvertence rather
than intentional misbehavior.  The Code of Ethics Officer is authorized
to impose the minimum sanction on employees without further Committee
action.  However, the sanctions noted below are only minimums and the
Committee reserves the right to impose additional sanctions such as
higher monetary sanctions, trading bans, suspension or termination of
employment as it determines to be  appropriate.

The minimum sanction for a violation of the following Rules is
disgorgement of any profits or payment of avoided losses and the
following payments:

Section IA, Rule 1 (Pre-clearance and Restricted List)
Section IB, Rule 1 (Short-selling)
Section IB, Rule 2 (IPOs)
Section IB, Rule 3 (Private Placements)
Section IB, Rule 4 (Trading with Inside Information)
Section IB, Rules 6-8 (Holding and trading of Putnam Funds)
Section II, Rule 2 (7-Day Rule)
Section II, Rule 3 (Black-out Rule)
Section II, Rule 4, (Contra-Trading Rule)
Section II, Rule 5 (Trading for personal benefit)


Officer Level    SMD/MD         SVP/VP         AVP/non-officer
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st violation     $500           $250           $50
2nd             $1,000           $500          $100
3rd             Minimum monetary sanction as above with ban on all new
                personal individual investments.

The minimum sanction for violations of all other rules in the Code is as
follows:

Officer Level    SMD/MD         SVP/VP         AVP/non-officer
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st violation     $100            $50           $25
Subsequent        $200           $100           $50

The reference period for determining whether a violation is initial or
subsequent will be five years.

Excessive Trading

Effective with the 2nd quarter of 2005, the maximum number of trades
permitted in individual securities per quarter is reduced from 25 to 10.
Section 1B, Rule 9 is effective April 1, 2005, will read as follows:

"Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in excessive
trading for their personal accounts.  Beginning in the second quarter of
2005, employees will be prohibited from making more than 10 trades in
individual securities in any given quarter.  Excessive trading within
Putnam open-end funds is prohibited."

Access Persons; Holding Period for Individual Securities

Effective with the 2nd quarter of 2005, the holding period rule for
Access Person investments in individual securities will increase from 60
to 90 days.  Section II, Rule 1 will read, effective April 1, 2005 as
follows:

"No Access Person shall purchase and then sell at a profit, or sell and
then repurchase at a lower price, any security or related derivative
security with 90 calendar days."

Access Person Reporting

The deadline by which Access Persons are required to file quarterly
statements of all transactions has been increased from 10 to 15 calendar
days after the end of each quarter.  This change will be effective in
the April, 2005 filing.  Accordingly Section V, Rule 2, will now read as
follows:

"Every Access Person shall file a quarterly report within 15 calendar
days of the end of each quarter, recording all purchases and sales of
any securities for personal accounts as defined in the Definitions. (For
purposes of this Rule, securities shall include exchange traded funds
(ETFs), futures and any option on a security or securities index,
including broad based market indices excluded from the pre-clearance
requirement and also includes transactions in Putnam open-end funds if
the account for the Putnam funds is not held at Putnam Securities
Services or in a Putnam retirement plan and for transactions in US
mutual funds sub-advised by Putnam."

Access Person Definition

As required by new SEC rule 204A-1, the definition of Access Persons
under the Code has been amended, effective February 1, 2005 to include
Putnam employees with access to non public information about affiliated
mutual fund portfolio holdings.  The definition of Access Person will
read as of February 1, 2005 as follows:

"Access Persons are:

(a) all employees in Putnam's Investment Division;

(b) all directors and officers of all Putnam entities which are SEC
    registered investment advisers;

(c) all members of Putnam's Executive Board and all Managing Directors
    in Putnam's marketing and sales organizations; and

(d) any other employee of Putnam who, in connection with regular duties,
    has access to nonpublic information about any client's purchase or sale
    of securities or to information regarding recommendations with respect
    to such purchases or sales or who has access to nonpublic information
    regarding the portfolio holdings of any Putnam advised or sub-advised
    mutual fund.

Each employee will be informed if he or she is considered an Access
Person.  The Code of Ethics Officer maintains a list of all Access
Persons."

                             THE PUTNAM FUNDS

                              Code of Ethics

Each of The Putnam Funds (the "Funds") has determined to adopt this Code
of Ethics with respect to certain types of personal securities
transactions by officers and Trustees of the Funds which might be deemed
to create possible conflicts of interest and to establish reporting
requirements and enforcement procedures with respect to such
transactions.

I. Rules Applicable to Officers and Trustees Affiliated with Putnam
Investments Trust or Its Subsidiaries

A. Incorporation of Adviser's Code of Ethics.  The provisions of the
Code of Ethics for employees of Putnam Investments Trust and its
subsidiaries (the "Putnam Investments Code of Ethics"), which is
attached as Appendix A hereto, are hereby incorporated herein as the
Funds' Code of Ethics applicable to officers and Trustees of the Funds
who are employees of the Funds or officers, directors or employees of
Putnam Investments Trust or its subsidiaries.  A violation of the Putnam
Investments' Code of Ethics shall constitute a violation of the Funds'
Code.

B. Reports.  Officers and Trustees of each of the Funds who are made
subject to the Putnam Investments' Code of Ethics pursuant to the
preceding paragraph shall file the reports required by the Putnam
Investments' Code of Ethics with the Code of Ethics Officer designated
therein.  A report filed with the Code of Ethics Officer shall be deemed
to be filed with each of the Funds of which the reporting individual is
an officer or Trustee.

C. Review and Reporting.

(1) The Code of Ethics Officer shall cause the reported personal
securities transactions to be compared with completed and contemplated
portfolio transactions of each of the Funds to determine whether a
violation of this Code may have occurred.  Before making any
determination that a violation has been committed by any person, the
Code of Ethics Officer shall give such person an opportunity to supply
additional explanatory material.

(2) If the Code of Ethics Officer determines that a violation of any
provision of this Code has or may have occurred, he shall submit his
written determination, together with any additional explanatory
material, to the Audit and Pricing Committee of the Funds at its next
meeting.

D. Sanctions.  In addition to reporting violations of this Code to the
Audit and Pricing Committee of the Funds as provided in Section I-C(2),
the Code of Ethics officer shall also report to such Committee any
sanctions imposed with respect to such violations.  The Committee
reserves the right to impose such additional sanctions as it deems
appropriate.

II. Rules Applicable to Unaffiliated Trustees

A. Definitions.

(1) "Beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in the same manner as it
would be in determining whether a person is subject to the provisions of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(2) "Control" means the power to exercise a controlling influence over
the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the
result of an official position with such company.

(3) "Interested Trustee" means a Trustee of a Fund who is an "interested
person" of the Fund within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

(4) "Purchase or sale of a security" includes, among other things, the
writing of an option to purchase or sell a security.

(5) "Security" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act (in effect, all securities)
except that it shall not include securities issued by the Government of
the United States or an agency thereof, bankers' acceptances, bank
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and high-quality short-term
debt investments, including repurchase agreements, and shares of
registered open-end investment companies, but shall include any security
convertible into or exchangeable for a security.

(6) "Unaffiliated Trustee" means a Trustee who is not made subject to
the Putnam Investments Code of Ethics pursuant to Part I hereof.

B. Prohibited Purchases and Sales.  No Unaffiliated Trustee of any of
the Funds shall purchase or sell, directly or indirectly, any security
in which he has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any direct
or indirect beneficial ownership and which to his actual knowledge at
the time of such purchase or sale:

(1) is being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund;

(2) is being purchased or sold by the Fund; or

(3) was purchased or sold by the Fund within the most recent five days
if such person participated in the recommendation to, or the decision
by, Putnam Investment Management to purchase or sell such security for
the Fund.

C. Exempted Transactions.  The prohibitions of Section II-B of this Code
shall not apply to:

(1) purchases or sales of securities effected in any account over which
the Unaffiliated Trustee has no direct or indirect influence or control;

(2) purchases or sales of securities which are non-volitional on the
part of either the Unaffiliated Trustee or the Fund;

(3) purchases of securities which are part of an automatic dividend
reinvestment plan;

(4) purchases of securities effected upon the exercise of rights issued
by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to
the extent such rights were acquired from such issuer, and sales of such
rights so acquired;

(5) purchases or sales of securities other than those exempted in (1)
through (4) above which do not cause the Unaffiliated Trustee to gain
improperly a personal benefit through his relationship with the Fund and
are only remotely potentially harmful to a Fund because they would be
very unlikely to affect a highly institutional market, and are
previously approved by the Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer of the
Funds, in consultation with the Code of Ethics Officer, which approval
shall be confirmed in writing.

D. Reporting.

(1) Whether or not one of the exemptions listed in Section II-C applies
and except as provided in Section II-C(5), every Unaffiliated Trustee of
a Fund shall file with the Funds' Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer a
report containing the information described in Section II-D(2) of this
Code with respect to purchases or sales of any security in which such
Unaffiliated Trustee has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any
direct or indirect beneficial ownership, if such Trustee, at the time of
that transaction, knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his
official duties as a Trustee of the Fund, should have known that, during
the 15-day period immediately preceding or after the date of the
transaction by the Trustee:

(a) such security was or is to be purchased or sold by the Fund or

(b) such security was or is being considered for purchase or sale by the
Fund;

provided, however, that an Unaffiliated Trustee shall not be required to
make a report with respect to transactions effected for any account over
which such person does not have any direct or indirect influence or
control.

(2) Every report shall be made not later than 10 days after the end of
the calendar quarter in which the transaction to which the report
relates was effected, and shall contain the following information:

(a) The date of the transaction, the title, the number of shares, the
interest rate and maturity date (if applicable) and the principal amount
of each security involved;

(b) The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or any other
type of acquisition or disposition);

(c) The price at which the transaction was effected; and

(d) The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the
transaction was effected; and

(e) the date that the report is submitted by each Unaffiliated Trustee.

(3) Every report concerning a purchase or sale prohibited under Section
II-B hereof with respect to which the reporting person relies upon one
of the exemptions provided in Section II-C shall contain a brief
statement of the exemption relied upon and the circumstances of the
transaction.

(4) Any such report may contain a statement that the report shall not be
construed as an admission by the person making such report that he has
any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the security to which the
report relates.

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an
Unaffiliated Trustee who is an "interested person" of the Funds shall
file the reports required by Rule 17j-1(d)(1) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 with the Code of Ethics Officer of Putnam
Investments.  Such reports shall be reviewed by such Officer as provided
in Section I-C(1) and any related violations shall be reported by him to
the Audit and Pricing Committee as provided in Section I-C(2).  The
Committee may impose such additional sanctions as it deems appropriate.

E. Review and Reporting.

(1) The Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer of the Funds, in
consultation with the Code of Ethics Officer of Putnam Investments,
shall cause the reported personal securities transactions that he
receives pursuant to Section II-D(1) to be compared with completed and
contemplated portfolio transactions of the Funds to determine whether
any transaction ("Reviewable Transactions") listed in Section II-B
(disregarding exemptions provided by Section II-C(1) through (5)) may
have occurred.

(2) If the Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer determines that a
Reviewable Transaction may have occurred, he shall then determine
whether a violation of this Code may have occurred, taking into account
all the exemptions provided under Section II-C.  Before making any
determination that a violation has occurred, the Legal and Compliance
Liaison Officer shall give the person involved an opportunity to supply
additional information regarding the transaction in question.

F. Sanctions.  If the Legal and Compliance Liaison determines that a
violation of this Code has occurred, he shall so advise the Funds' Audit
and Pricing Committee, and provide the Committee with a report of the
matter, including any additional information supplied by such person.
The Committee may impose such sanctions as it deems appropriate.

III. Miscellaneous

A. Amendments to the Putnam Investments' Code of Ethics.  Any amendment
to the Putnam Investments' Code of Ethics shall be deemed an amendment
to Section I-A of this Code effective 30 days after written notice of
such amendment shall have been received by the Chairman of the Funds,
unless the Trustees of the Funds expressly determine that such amendment
shall become effective at an earlier or later date or shall not be
adopted.

B. Records.  The Funds shall maintain records in the manner and to the
extent set forth below, which records may be maintained on microfilm
under the conditions described in Rule 31a-2(f)(1) under the Investment
Company Act and shall be available for examination by representatives of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) A copy of this Code and any other code which is, or at any time
within the past five years has been, in effect shall be preserved in an
easily accessible place;

result of such violation shall be preserved in an easily accessible
place for a period of not less than five years following the end of the
fiscal year in which the violation occurs;

Code shall be preserved for a period of not less than five years from
the end of the fiscal year in which it is made, the first two years in

Supplement - dated April 1, 2005 to Putnam's Code of Ethics

The Putnam Code of Ethics Oversight Committee has approved the following
amendments, effective April 1, 2005:

Section III - Rule 12: Interest in Entities Doing Business with Putnam

Family Member Conflicts Policy

No employee or member of an employee's immediate family shall have any
direct or indirect personal financial interests in companies which do
business with Putnam, unless such interest is disclosed and approved by
the Code of Ethics Officer. Investment holdings in public companies
which are not material to the employee are excluded from this
prohibition. The Code also provides more detailed supplemental rules to
address potential conflicts of interests which may arise if members of
employees' families are closely involved in doing business with Putnam.

Corporate purchase of goods and services

Putnam will not acquire goods and services from any firm in which a
member of an employee's immediate family serves as the sales
representative in a senior management capacity or has an ownership
interest with the supplier firm (excluding normal investment holdings in
public companies) without permission from the Director of Procurement
and the Code of Ethics Officer. Any employee who is aware of a proposal
to purchase goods and services from a firm at which a member of the
employee's immediate family meets one of the previously mentioned
conditions must notify the Director of Procurement and the Code of
Ethics Officer.

Portfolio Trading

Putnam will not allocate any trades for a portfolio to any firm that
employs a member of an employee's immediate family as a sales
representative to Putnam (in a primary, secondary or back up role). Any
Putnam employee who is aware that an immediate family member serves as a
broker-dealer's sales representative to Putnam should inform the Code of
Ethics Officer.

Definition of Immediate Family

"Immediate family" of an employee means (1) husband or wife of the
employee, (2) any child, sibling or parent of an employee and any person
married to a child, sibling, or parent of an employee and (3) any other
person who lives in the same household as the employee.

Section III - Rule 5: Political Contributions/Solicitations Policy

Political Activities, Contributions and Lobbying

Corporate Contributions and Solicitation.  Political activities of
corporations such as Putnam are highly regulated, and corporate
political contributions are largely prohibited.  Accordingly, no
contributions may be made with Putnam corporate funds to any political
party or campaign, whether directly or by reimbursement of such a
contribution, unless pre-approved in advance by the Chief Compliance
Officer.  Employee contributions to any pending or proposed client of
Putnam, regardless of whether the employee will seek reimbursement from
Putnam for such contributions, must be pre-approved in advance by the
Chief Compliance Officer. Donations of Putnam property and of employee
time when working for Putnam are also prohibited. No Putnam employee may
make any solicitation for or endorsement of any campaign or candidate
using Putnam letterhead, referencing Putnam, or while on Putnam
business.

Employee Personal Political Contributions. Employees, so long as they do
not use Putnam assets, or state or imply that Putnam is involved in a
campaign, are free to engage in political activities subject to three
restrictions as follows:

1. Some states and localities have laws that prohibit employees from
making political contributions to candidates for state and local office
if their employer has an investment management contract with, or is
seeking one from, the state or locality. Accordingly, Putnam employees
must pre-clear with the Chief Compliance Officer any contributions to
candidates for any of the following offices:

* State or local offices in California
* The office of State Treasurer of Connecticut or Vermont
* State or local offices in New Jersey
* Any local office in the city of Houston, Texas

2. Contributions to state and local officials with whom Putnam has a
business relationship or from whom is seeking a business relationship
must be pre-cleared with the Chief Compliance Officer.

3. Certain employees at PRM involved in the CollegeAdvantage program are
restricted from making contributions to candidates for offices in Ohio
under the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. These
employees are separately identified and informed by Putnam's Compliance
Department of applicable requirements.

Gifts. Employees must obtain pre-approval from the Chief Compliance
Officer prior to providing any gift (including meals, entertainment,
transportation or lodging) to any government official or employee.

Lobbying.  Federal and state law imposes limits and registration
requirements on efforts by individuals and companies to influence the
passage of legislation or to obtain business from governments.
Accordingly, Putnam employees should not engage in any lobbying
activities without approval from Putnam's Director of Government
Relations. Lobbying does not include solicitation of investment
management business through the ordinary course of business, such as
responding to RFPs.
