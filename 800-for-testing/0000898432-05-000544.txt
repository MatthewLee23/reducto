CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc., for the period ending April 30, 2005.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments,
and its unaudited financial statements for the reporting period.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide high current income, and its
secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation. In seeking to accomplish
both, we have assembled a portfolio with a broad mix of equity securities of
real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real estate companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks real estate securities that are
attractively priced relative to their historical growth rates and the valuation
of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investing philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. Portfolio Commentary

For the six months ending April 30, 2005, on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, the
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (AMEX: NRO) provided a
5.66% return, compared to a gain of 7.06% for the NAREIT Equity REIT Index. In
our opinion, the positive returns for the broader REIT index reflect the general
strength of the REIT market during the reporting period and are an indication of
continued investor interest in and improving fundamentals for REIT securities.
The Fund's underperformance relative to the index can be attributed to its
holdings of preferred REIT securities, which did not perform as well as REIT
common stocks over the past six months.

We believe that the positive trends that lifted the broader REIT market over the
past six months will remain intact as investors continue to search for higher
yielding securities in a rising, but still low interest rate environment.
Commercial real estate fundamentals in particular have continued to improve, as
evidenced by increasing rent and occupancy levels.

Our emphasis on diversification across property sectors and geographic regions
continues to enhance the Fund's ability to deliver consistent returns. The
Fund's position in the office sector provides a good example. Performance in
this area improved during the first four months of calendar 2005, reflecting the
attractive valuation levels and dividend yields that were prevalent in the
sector at the start of the year. Since then, continued evidence of an improving
leasing environment has positively affected valuations. We expect this trend to
continue throughout the year.

During the six-month reporting period, the Fund also benefited from holdings in
regional malls, hotels and self storage, but was hurt by its holdings in mixed
asset REITs. We remain optimistic about the Fund's performance and will continue
to emphasize office and apartment REITs.

Along with our conviction that real estate fundamentals should improve over the
next 12 months, we also believe that merger and acquisition activity may
accelerate. Many investors, ourselves included, believe that REITs are trading
at a discount to their underlying real estate value. In our opinion, this
discount, combined with the current accommodative borrowing environment, should
lead to increased M&A activity. We believe that the Fund could be a beneficiary
of that development, thanks to our focus on buying REITs that trade at a
discount to net asset value.

The current economic environment is characterized by rising short-term interest
rates, benign long-term interest rates and expected GDP growth of 3%. We
believe, absent a recession, that REITs are on track for 8-9% earnings-per-share
growth in calendar 2005 as demand for real estate continues to outstrip supply.
The first quarter earnings season confirmed this trend. If there is continued
evidence of earnings acceleration, it should benefit REIT share prices as we
move through the year. We continue to seek companies with improving
fundamentals, strong financial positions and opportunistic management teams.

Sincerely,

              /s/ Steven R. Brown

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in equity securities by Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities
     Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") are valued at the latest sales price where
     that price is readily available; securities for which no sales were
     reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at the last available bid
     price. Securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market are normally
     valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided
     by NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most recently reported price
     as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price is outside the range of
     the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid and asked prices that
     dealers quote to each other when trading for their own accounts); in that
     case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the inside bid or asked price,
     whichever is closer. Because of delays in reporting trades, the NOCP may
     not be based on the price of the last trade to occur before the market
     closes. The Fund values all other securities by a method the Board of
     Directors of the Fund (the "Board") believes accurately reflects fair
     value. Numerous factors may be considered when determining the fair value
     of a security, including available analyst, media or other reports, trading
     in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer of the security being fair valued
     has other securities outstanding. Foreign security prices are furnished by
     independent quotation services and expressed in local currency values.
     Foreign security prices are translated from the local currency into U.S.
     dollars using the exchange rate as of 12:00 noon, Eastern time. The Board
     has approved the use of FT Interactive Data Corporation ("FT Interactive")
     to assist in determining the fair value of the Fund's foreign equity
     securities in the wake of certain significant events. When changes in the
     value of a certain index suggest that the closing prices on the foreign
     exchanges may no longer represent the amount that the Fund could expect to
     receive for those securities, FT Interactive will provide adjusted prices
     for certain foreign equity securities using an analysis based on historical
     correlations between the prices of those securities and changes in the
     index. In the absence of precise information about the market values of
     these foreign securities as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange,
     the Board has determined on the basis of available data that prices
     adjusted in this way are likely to be closer to the prices the Fund could
     realize on a current sale than are the prices of those securities
     established at the close of the foreign markets in which the securities
     primarily trade. However, fair value prices are necessarily estimates, and
     there is no assurance that such a price will be at or close to the price at
     which the security next trades. Short-term debt securities with less than
     60 days until maturity may be valued at cost which, when combined with
     interest earned, approximates market value.

#    At cost, which approximates market value.

##   At April 30, 2005 the cost of investments for U.S. Federal income tax
     purposes was $773,375,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of investments was
     $75,702,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of investments was
     $6,728,000, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $68,974,000, based
     on cost for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

@    Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime Money") is also managed by
     Neuberger Berman Management Inc. (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements) and may be considered an affiliate since it has the same
     officers, Board members, and investment manager as the Fund and because, at
     times, the Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
     Prime Money.

^    All or a portion of this security is on loan (see Note A of Notes to
     Financial Statements).

++   Managed by an affiliate of Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and could be
     deemed an affiliate of the Fund (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements).

^^   Security exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. These
     securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration, normally
     to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and are deemed liquid. At
     April 30, 2005, these securities amounted to $1,249,000 or 0.23% of net
     assets applicable to common shareholders.

@@   All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for interest
     rate swap contracts.

*    Non-income producing security.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
     "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as a
     non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Board of
     Directors of the Fund (the "Board") may classify or re-classify any
     unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred
     stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on a trade date basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
     ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any,
     are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest
     income, including accretion of original issue discount, where applicable,
     and accretion of discount on short-term investments, if any, is recorded on
     the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions
     and foreign currency transactions, if any, are recorded on the basis of
     identified cost and stated separately in the Statement of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to qualify
     as a regulated investment company by complying with the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
     investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its earnings to
     its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income or excise tax provision is
     required.

     Income dividends and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
     accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to
     differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
     held by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of
     distributions made by the Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2004, permanent differences resulting
     primarily from different book and tax accounting for distributions in
     excess of earnings and income recognized on interest rate swaps were
     reclassified at year end. These reclassifications had no effect on net
     income, net assets or net assets per share of the Fund.

                                       12

     The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended October 31,
     2004 and the one day ended October 31, 2003 was as follows:

     As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as follows:

</TABLE>

     The difference between book and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments, wash
     sales and income recognized on interest rate swaps.

5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income, net of
     expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of the Fund to declare
     quarterly and pay monthly distributions to common shareholders. The Fund
     has adopted a policy to pay common shareholders a stable distribution. The
     Fund's ability to satisfy its policy will depend on a number of factors,
     including the stability of income received from its investments, the
     availability of capital gains, and distributions paid on preferred shares.
     In an effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, the Fund may pay
     distributions consisting of net investment income, realized gains and
     paid-in capital. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to
     pay distributions of a particular size, or that distributions will consist
     solely of net investment income and realized capital gains. The composition
     of the Fund's distributions for the calendar year 2005 will be reported to
     Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099. The Fund may pay distributions in
     excess of those required by its stable distribution policy to avoid excise
     tax or to satisfy the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
     Code. Income dividends and capital gain distributions to common
     shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net realized capital
     gains, if any, will be offset to the extent of any available capital loss
     carryforwards. Any such offset will not reduce the level of the stable
     distribution paid by the Fund. Dividends and distributions to preferred
     shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities issued
     by real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts
     ("REITs"). The distributions received from REITs held by the Fund are
     generally comprised of income, capital gains, and return of REIT capital,
     but the REITs do not report this information to the Fund until the
     following calendar year. At October 31, 2004, the Fund estimated these
     amounts within the financial statements since the information was not
     available from the REITs until after the Fund's fiscal year end. At April
     30, 2005, the Fund estimated these amounts for the period January 1, 2005
     through April 30, 2005 within the financial statements since 2005
     information is not available from the REITs until after the Fund's fiscal
     period. For the year ended October 31, 2004, the character of distributions
     paid to

                                       13
<PAGE>

     shareholders is disclosed within the Statement of Changes and is also based
     on these estimates. All estimates are based upon REIT information sources
     available to the Fund together with actual IRS Forms 1099 received to date.
     Based on past experience it is probable that a portion of the Fund's
     distributions during the current fiscal year will be considered tax return
     of capital but the actual amount of the tax return of capital, if any, is
     not determinable until after the Fund's fiscal year. After calendar
     year-end, when the Fund learns the nature of the distributions paid by the
     REITs during that year, distributions previously identified as income are
     often recharacterized as return of capital and/or capital gain. After all
     applicable REITs have informed the Fund of the actual breakdown of
     distributions paid to the Fund during its fiscal year, estimates previously
     recorded are adjusted to reflect actual results. As a result, the
     composition of the Fund's distributions as reported herein may differ from
     the final composition determined after calendar year-end and reported to
     Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099.

     On March 30, 2005, the Fund declared two monthly distributions to common
     shareholders in the amount of $0.10 per share per month, payable after the
     close of the reporting period, on May 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, to
     shareholders of record on May 13, 2005 and June 13, 2005, respectively,
     with ex-dividend dates of May 11, 2005 and June 9, 2005, respectively.

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund.
     Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
     includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management
     serves as investment manager, that are not directly attributed to the Fund
     are allocated among the Fund and the other investment companies in the
     complex or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where
     a more appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund re-classified
     12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A Auction Market
     Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series C
     Auction Market Preferred Shares and Series D Auction Market Preferred
     Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27, 2004, the Fund issued 2,450 Series A AMPS,
     2,450 Series B AMPS, 2,450 Series C AMPS and 2,450 Series D AMPS. All AMPS
     have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
     unpaid distributions, whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but
     excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").

     Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period, distributions to
     preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily and paid
     every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C
     and Series D AMPS. Distribution rates are reset every 7 days for Series A
     and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS based on
     the results of an auction, except during special rate periods. For the six
     months ended April 30, 2005, distribution rates ranged from 1.68% to 3.21%
     for Series A, 1.90% to 3.35% for Series B, 1.95% to 3.45% for Series C and
     1.87% to 3.20% for Series D AMPS. The Fund declared distributions to
     preferred shareholders for the period May 1, 2005 to May 31, 2005 of
     $161,116, $159,548, $165,372 and $165,857 for Series A, Series B, Series C
     and Series D AMPS, respectively.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second business day
     preceding any distribution payment date at Liquidation Value. The Fund is
     also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS. Failure to
     comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
     distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or
     could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value. The
     holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common stock as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the Fund's
     charter. The holders of the AMPS, voting as a separate class, are entitled
     at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a majority of
     the Directors of the Fund if the Fund fails to pay distributions on AMPS
     for two consecutive years.

8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
     transactions, with institutions that Management has determined are
     creditworthy, to reduce the risk that an increase in short-term interest
     rates could reduce common share net earnings as a result of leverage. Under
     the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Fund agrees to pay the
     swap counter party a fixed-rate payment in exchange for the counter party's
     paying the Fund a variable-rate payment that is intended to approximate all
     or a portion of the Fund's variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's
     AMPS. The fixed-rate and variable-rate payment flows are netted against
     each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other on a
     monthly basis. The Fund segregates cash or liquid securities having a value
     at least equal to the Fund's net payment obligations under any swap
     transaction, marked to market daily.

     Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to comply
     with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the failure of a
     counter party is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
     received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the
     contract. Additionally, risks may arise from movements in interest rates
     unanticipated by Management.

     Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on the swaps
     are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized gains/losses, along with the
     fair value of the future periodic payment streams on the swaps. The
     unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic interim net interest
     payments are reclassified to realized gains/losses in conjunction with the
     actual net receipt or payment of such amounts. The reclassifications do not
     impact the Fund's total net assets or its total net increase (decrease) in
     net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations. At
     April 30, 2005, the Fund had outstanding interest rate swap contracts as
     follows:

9    SECURITY LENDING: Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities
     and Exchange Commission, the Fund entered into a Securities Lending
     Agreement ("Agreement") with Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), an
     affiliate of the Fund, pursuant to which Neuberger acts as the Fund's
     lending agent. Securities loans involve certain risks including delays or
     inability to recover the loaned securities or, in the event a borrower
     should fail financially, foreclose against the collateral. Neuberger, under
     the general supervision of the Board, monitors the creditworthiness of the
     parties to whom the Fund makes security loans. The Fund will not lend
     securities on which covered call options have been written, or lend
     securities on terms which would prevent the Fund from qualifying as a
     regulated investment company. The Fund receives cash collateral equal to at
     least 102% of the current market value of the loaned securities. Prior to
     February 7, 2005, the Fund invested the cash collateral in the N&B
     Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Old Fund"), which was managed by
     State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street") pursuant to guidelines
     approved by Management. Effective February 7, 2005, the Fund changed the
     collateral investment vehicle from the Old Fund to the Neuberger Berman
     Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Quality Fund"), a fund managed by
     Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC (formerly Lincoln Capital Fixed Income
     Management Company, LLC), an affiliate of Management, as approved by the
     Board.

     Under the Agreement, Neuberger guarantees a certain amount of revenue to
     the Fund and receives any revenue earned in excess of the guaranteed amount
     as a lending agency fee. For the six months ended April 30, 2005, revenue
     received under the Agreement was $51,380.

     Income earned on the securities loaned, if any, is reflected in the
     Statement of Operations under the caption "Income from securities
     loaned-affiliated issuer."

10   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
     institutions that Management has determined are creditworthy. Each
     repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The Fund requires that the
     securities purchased in a repurchase agreement be transferred to the
     custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the Fund to assert a perfected
     security interest in those securities in the event of a default under the
     repurchase agreement. The Fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the
     securities transferred to ensure that their value, including accrued
     interest, is greater than amounts owed to the Fund under each such
     repurchase agreement.

11   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN MANAGEMENT INC.:
     Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission, the Fund may invest in a money market fund managed by
     Management or an affiliate. Prior to December 2004, the Fund invested in
     the Neuberger Berman Institutional Cash Fund (the "Cash Fund"), as approved
     by the Board. As of December 2004, the Fund changed its investment from the
     Cash Fund to the newly created Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime
     Money"), as approved by the Board. The Cash Fund and Prime Money each seek
     to provide the highest available current income consistent with safety and
     liquidity. For any cash that the Fund invests in the Cash Fund or Prime
     Money, Management waives a portion of its management fee equal to the
     management fee it receives from the Cash Fund and Prime Money on those
     assets (the "Arrangement"). For the six months ended April 30, 2005,
     management fees waived

                                       16
<PAGE>

     under this Arrangement with respect to the Cash Fund and Prime Money
     amounted to $591 and $1,015, respectively. For the six months ended April
     30, 2005, income earned under this Arrangement with respect to the Cash
     Fund and Prime Money amounted to $10,010 and $30,323, respectively, and is
     reflected in the Statement of Operations under the caption "Income from
     investments in affiliated issuers."

12   ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay all
     organizational expenses and the amount by which the Fund's offering costs
     for common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03 per share. There were
     no costs incurred by Management. Offering costs for common stock paid by
     the Fund were charged as a reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the
     completion of the Fund's offerings and amounted to $775,349.

     Additionally, offering costs of $299,820 and sales loads of $2,450,000
     incurred through the issuance of AMPS were charged as a reduction of common
     stock paid-in-capital at the completion of the Fund's AMPS offering.

     As of April 30, 2005, there was no remaining payable for offering costs.

13   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
     investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
     securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and
     non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving the majority
     of their revenue from the ownership, construction, financing, management
     and/or sale of commercial, industrial, and/or residential real estate.
     Values of the securities of such companies may fluctuate more due to
     economic, legal, cultural, geopolitical or technological developments
     affecting the United States real estate industry, or a segment of the
     United States real estate industry in which the Fund owns a substantial
     position, than would the shares of a fund not concentrated in the real
     estate industry.

14   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Fund's organizational
     documents provide that its officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Fund. In addition, both in some of its principal service contracts and in
     the normal course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against the Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, the Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

                                       17
<PAGE>

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the following annual rates:

</TABLE>

     Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
     31, 2011.

     For the six months ended April 30, 2005, such waived fees amounted to
     $969,021.

     The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. The Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street as its sub-administrator
     under a Sub-Administration Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee
     for all services received under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and
     sub-adviser to the Fund, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers
     Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly-owned holding company. Neuberger is
     retained by Management to furnish it with investment recommendations and
     research information without added cost to the Fund. Several individuals
     who are officers and/or Directors of the Fund are also employees of
     Neuberger and/or Management.

     The Fund entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it to
     pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the
     commissions it pays to a broker that is not a related party of the Fund.
     Expenses paid through this program may include costs of custodial, transfer
     agency or accounting services. For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the
     impact of this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $3,625.

     The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its custodian
     contract. For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the impact of this
     arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $605.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, the Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that the
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the AMPS Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a minimum level
     set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to maintain the AAA/Aaa
     rating on the AMPS. "Discounted Value" refers to the fact that the rating
     agencies require the Fund, in performing this calculation, to

                                       18
<PAGE>

     discount portfolio securities below their face value, at rates determined
     by the rating agencies. The Fund pays a fee to State Street for the
     preparation of this report.

     NOTE C--SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS:

     During the six months ended April 30, 2005, there were purchase and sale
     transactions (excluding short-term securities and interest rate swap
     contracts) of $42,034,319 and $23,075,982, respectively.

     During the six months ended April 30, 2005, brokerage commissions on

     **   Prior to February 7, 2005, the Old Fund, an investment vehicle
          established by the Fund's custodian, was used to invest cash the Fund
          receives as collateral for securities loans. Effective February 7,
          2005, the Fund changed the collateral investment vehicle from the Old
          Fund to the Quality Fund, a fund managed by Lehman Brothers Asset
          Management LLC, an affiliate of Management, as approved by the Board.
          The Fund's shares in the Old Fund and Quality Fund were and are
          non-voting. However, because all shares of the Old Fund and Quality
          Fund were and are held by funds in the related investment company
          complex, the Old Fund and Quality Fund may have been and may be
          considered affiliates of the Fund.

     ***  The Cash Fund and Prime Money are also managed by Management and may
          be considered affiliates since they have the same officers, Board
          members, and investment manager as the Fund and because, at times, the
          Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the
          Cash Fund or Prime Money, respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

^^   The per share amounts which are shown have been computed based on the
     average number of shares outstanding during each fiscal period.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may
     be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Total return would
     have been lower if Management had not waived a portion of the investment
     management fee. Performance data current to the most recent month-end are
     available at www.nb.com.

#    The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

     not undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net expenses to

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

                                       23
<PAGE>

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.
