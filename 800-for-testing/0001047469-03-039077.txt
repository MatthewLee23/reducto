(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect broker commissions
or sales charges. Total return for a period of less than one year is not
annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at September 30, 2003.

PIMCO HIGH INCOME FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2003 (unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO High Income Fund (the "Fund"), was organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on February 18, 2003. Prior to commencing operations on April 30, 2003,
the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 6,981 shares of
beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,003 to Allianz
Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PIMCO Advisors Fund
Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"), serves as the Fund's Investment
Manager and is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an unlimited amount of
$0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to seek high current income. Capital
appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund attempts to achieve these
objectives by investing in a diversified portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated
debt obligations and other income-producing securities that are primarily rated
below investment grade.

The Fund issued 105,000,000 shares of common stock in its initial public
offering. An additional 8,900,000 shares were issued in connection with the
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. These shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.675 per share.
Common offering costs of $1,650,000 (representing $0.014 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment Manager agreed to pay all common offering costs
(other than the sales load) and organizational expenses exceeding $0.03 per
share. Since aggregate offering costs and organizational expenses were less than
$0.03 per share, common share, organizational expenses of $15,000 were expensed
in the current period. In addition, the underwriters commission and offering
costs associated with the issuance of Preferred Shares in the amounts of
$9,000,000 and $625,000, respectively, have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as would involve future
claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
The Fund determines its net asset value at the close of regular trading
(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on
each day the NYSE is open. Debt securities are valued by an independent pricing
service approved by the Board of Trustees. Certain fixed income securities,
including those to be purchased under firm commitment agreements, are normally
valued on the basis of quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or independent
pricing services. Any security or financial instrument for which market
quotations are not readily available is valued at fair value as determined in
good faith under procedures established by the Board of Trustees. Short-term
investments having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the lives of the
respective securities using the effective interest method.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the
other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of its ordinary income and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar
year the Fund intends not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

                                       16
<Page>

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Fund declares dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net
investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are considered either
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current
and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(e) CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
The Fund enters into credit default swap contracts ("swaps") for hedging
purposes or to add leverage.

As a seller in the credit default swap contract, the Fund would be required to
pay the par or other agreed-upon value of a referenced debt obligation to the
counterparty in the event of a default by a third party, such as a U.S. or
foreign corporate issuer, on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund
would receive from the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term
of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default
occurs, the Fund would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment
obligations. Such periodic payments are accrued daily and recorded as interest
income.

The Fund may also purchase credit default swap contracts in order to hedge
against the risk of default of debt securities held in the portfolio, in which
case the Fund would function as the counterparty referenced in the preceding
paragraph. As a purchaser of credit default swap contract, the Fund would
receive the par or other agreed upon value of a referenced debt obligation from
the counterparty in the event of default by a third party, such as a U.S. or
foreign corporate issuer on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund
would make periodic payments to the counterparty over the term of the contract
provided no event of default has occurred. Such periodic payments are accrued
daily and charged to interest income by the Fund.

Swaps are marked to market daily by the Fund's Investment Manager based upon
quotations from market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of Operations by the
Fund. For a credit default swap sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon
amount made by the Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt
obligation is recorded as the cost of the referenced debt obligation
purchased/received. For a credit default swap purchased by the Fund, the agreed
upon amount received by the Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt
obligation is recorded as proceeds from sale/delivery of the referenced debt
obligation and the resulting gain or loss realized on the referenced debt
obligation is recorded as such by the Fund.

Entering into swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and
documentation risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no
liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may
default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the
contractual terms in the agreements.

(f) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund may enter into transactions with its custodian bank or securities
brokerage firms approved by the Board of Trustees whereby it purchases
securities under agreements to resell at an agreed upon price and date
("repurchase agreements"). Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in
the financial statements. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which
consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset backed securities,
are held by the custodian bank until maturity of the repurchase agreement.
Provisions of the repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Fund
require that the market value of the collateral, including accrued interest
thereon, is sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the
counterparty defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if the
counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by
the Fund may be delayed or limited.

                                       18
<Page>

(g) REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements in order to add leverage to
the Fund's portfolio. In a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells
securities to a bank or broker-dealer and agrees to repurchase the securities at
a mutually agreed date and price. Generally, the effect of such a transaction is
that the Fund can recover and reinvest all or most of the cash invested in the
portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase
agreement and still be entitled to the returns associated with those portfolio
securities. Such transactions are advantageous if the interest cost to the Fund
of the reverse repurchase transaction is less than the returns it obtains on
investments purchased with the cash. Unless the Fund covers its positions in
reverse repurchase agreements (by segregating liquid assets at least equal in
amount to the forward purchase commitment), its obligations under the agreements
will be subject to the Fund's limitations on borrowings. Reverse repurchase
agreements involve leverage risk and also the risk that the market value of the
securities that the Fund is obligated to repurchase under the agreement may
decline below the repurchase price. In the event the buyer of securities under a
reverse repurchase agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the
Fund's use of the proceeds of the agreement may be restricted pending a
determination by the other party, or its trustee or receiver, whether to enforce
the Fund's obligation to repurchase the securities. The weighted average daily
balance of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding during the period ended
September 30, 2003 was $9,540,000 at a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%.

(h) FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS
A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two parties to buy
and sell a currency at a set exchange rate on a future date. The Fund may enter
into forward foreign currency contracts for the purpose of hedging against
foreign currency risk arising from the investment or anticipated investment in
securities denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund may also enter these
contracts for purposes of increasing exposure to a foreign currency or to shift
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country to another. The
market value of a forward foreign currency contract fluctuates with changes in
forward currency exchange rates. All commitments are marked to market daily at
the applicable exchange rates and any resulting unrealized gains and losses are
recorded. Realized gains or losses are recorded at the time the forward contract
matures or by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering these
contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign
currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

Forward foreign currency contracts outstanding at September 30, 2003 were:

purposes, risk management purposes or as part of its investment strategy. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the risk of
loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not perform
under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in the same
manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired through the
exercise of call options is increased by the premiums paid. The proceeds from
the securities sold through the exercise of put options is decreased by the
premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an written
option could result in the Fund purchasing a security at a price different from
the current market.

(j) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES
Credit-linked trust certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other vehicle formed under state law which, in turn, invests in a basket of
derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and
other securities, in order to provide exposure to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Like an investment in a bond, investments in these credit-linked trust
certificates represent the right to receive periodic income payments (in the
form of distributions) and payment of principal at the end of the term of the
certificate. However, these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential obligations to, the counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(k) LOAN PARTICIPATIONS
When the Fund purchases a loan participation, the Fund typically enters into a
contractual relationship with the lender or third party selling such
participations ("Selling Participant"), but not the borrower. When investing in
a loan participation, the Fund has the right to receive payments of principal,
interest and any fees to which it is entitled only from the lender selling the
loan agreement and only upon receipt by the lender of payments from the
borrower. The Fund generally has no right to enforce compliance with the terms
of the loan agreement with the borrower. As a result, the Fund assumes the
credit risk of the borrower, the Selling Participant and any other persons
interpositioned between the Fund and the borrower. The Fund may not directly
benefit from the collateral supporting the senior loan in which it has purchased
the loan participation.

(l) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES
The Fund benefits from an expense offset arrangement with its custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian and
accounting agent fees. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing
securities, they would have generated income for the Fund.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager of the Fund. Subject
to the supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees, the Investment Manager is
responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's business affairs and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investment Manager
receives an annual fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.70% of the
Fund's average daily net assets, inclusive of net assets attributable to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment Management
Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser") to manage the Fund's investments. Subject to the
supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all investment
decisions for the Fund. The Investment Manager (not the Fund) pays a portion of
the fees it receives as Investment Manager to the Sub-Adviser in return for its
services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.3575% of the Fund's average daily net
assets, inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding, for the period from commencement of operations through April 30,
2008 and at the maximum annual rate of 0.50% of average daily net assets,
inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding, thereafter. The Investment Manager informed the Fund that it paid
the Sub-Adviser $3,283,238 in connection with its sub-advisory services for the
period ended September 30, 2003.

3. INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES
For the period ended September 30, 2003, purchases and sales of investments,
other than short-term securities, were $2,884,075,870 and $430,782,148,
respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES
The Fund has issued 7,200 shares of Preferred Shares Series M, 7,200 shares of
Preferred Shares Series T, 7,200 shares of Preferred Shares Series W, 7,200
shares of Preferred Shares Series TH, and 7,200 shares of Preferred Shares
Series F each with a net asset and liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus
accrued dividends.

Dividends are accumulated daily at an annual rate set through auction
procedures. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid
annually.

For the period ended September 30, 2003, the annualized dividend rate ranged
from:

</Table>

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

5. SUBSEQUENT COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS
On October 1, 2003, a dividend of $0.121875 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable November 3, 2003 to shareholders of record on October 10,
2003.

On November 3, 2003, a dividend of $0.121875 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable December 1, 2003 to shareholders of record on November 14,
2003.

1.   I have reviewed this report on the Form N-CSR of the PIMCO High Income
     Fund.

2.   Based on my knowledge, the report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by the report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods in
     the report:

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
          material information relating to the registrant, including its
          consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
          entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
          prepared:

     (b)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of
          this report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

     (c)  Presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of
          the disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of
          the Evaluation Date;

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

<Page>

     (a)  All significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
          controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial data and have
          identified for the registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in
          internal controls; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of most recent evaluation, including any corrective
     actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
