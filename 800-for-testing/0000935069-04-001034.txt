          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  ANNUAL REPORT
                                  MAY 31, 2004

Dear Shareholders:

The First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund")
commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 27, 2004 under the
ticker symbol FCT. It is the second of two senior floating rate closed-end funds
launched by First Trust Advisors, L.P. ("First Trust") and Four Corners Capital
Management, LLC ("Four Corners"). The other fund trades under the ticker symbol
FCM. First Trust is the Fund's investment advisor. Four Corners is the
investment sub-advisor. Michael P. McAdams is the President and Chief Investment
Officer of Four Corners and is Co-Portfolio Manager of the Fund. He shares those
responsibilities with Robert I. Bernstein. Mike has been involved with the
management of senior loan portfolios since 1982. Bob was first exposed to the
asset class in 1986, and has been actively involved in the senior loan market
for the past 12 years.

Though the Fund has only been trading for a few weeks, the 0.25 percentage point
rate hike by the Federal Reserve on June 29 could be just the beginning for
those investors who own floating rate securities. When the Fed has tightened
monetary policy in the recent past, it has done so over a 12 to 15 month period.

Why is this rate hike so important for shareholders of FCT? It is important
because the floating rate component of senior loans is designed to track,
usually with a lag of 60 to 90 days, the movement of short-term interest rates,
which are influenced by the actions of the Federal Reserve. The trend for
short-term interest rates in an expanding economy tends to be up. In a rising
interest rate environment, there are good prospects for higher income with less
fluctuation of capital than would be experienced in a fixed-rate investment. In
fact, due to the strengthening economy, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index
default rate declined from its recent peak of 7.26% at the end of 2000 to around
1% today.

I encourage shareholders to read the commentary from the Four Corners' Portfolio
Managers.

Sincerely,



/S/JAMES A. BOWEN

A COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST TRUST FOUR/CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The period leading up to the May 18, 2004 inception of the First Trust/Four
Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or "the Fund"), has been a
particularly favorable environment for senior floating-rate loan investing. The
Fund has benefited from continuation of trends that are conducive to both
floating-rate and credit-focused investing. These trends include a recovery in
US economic fundamentals, stabilizing capital markets and favorable senior loan
market technical factors. Specifically, monthly economic indicators have
documented improvements in key employment, productivity, retail sales and
manufacturing. Global equity and debt markets have reopened to good companies
with credible prospects. And, commensurate with improving economic data, there
is a renewed focus on inflation and the prospects for interest rate increases.
This is especially appropriate at a time when the absolute level of rates has
been at or near the lowest levels in over 45 years.

As a review, senior loan income has historically tracked short-term interest
rates, which, in an expanding economy, tend to rise as an offset to the threat
of inflation. In such a rising interest rate environment, we believe there are
good prospects for higher income with less NAV downside than would be expected
from a fixed-rate investment. Further, the floating-rate senior loan income
should track the floating cost of the Fund's leverage, when implemented.

Over the past year, the performance of the benchmark for the senior loan market,
the Standard & Poors/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, has been strong. The loan market
as a whole also recorded growth through FCT's fiscal year as new institutional
loan issuance rose from the prior years' $46.6 billion to over $89.1 billion.
Similarly, secondary market depth also improved with secondary trading volume
increasing from $31 billion to $42 billion for the 3-month periods ending March
31, 2003 and 2004 respectively.

As a result of an increased concern for the impact of rising rates, demand for
floating rate investments during the last year has increased from both retail as
well as institutional investors. Such positive inflows into the asset class
represent a strong technical factor that has contributed to performance.

From the standpoint of quality, we remain confident that credit standards of
senior loans being underwritten today remain well above the levels that
contributed to the difficult default cycle of 2000-2002.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

Four Corner's investment strategy is designed to be an "all weather" strategy
focused on long-term performance. In that regard, our strategy focuses on
maintaining high analytical standards, portfolio diversity, and whenever
possible, a proactive sell discipline. Given the relatively strong growth
prospects of the economy anticipated at present, we have structured the
portfolio across industry groups that we expect to be most likely to benefit
from improving economic fundamentals while minimizing those industries that,
despite broad economic improvements, are exposed to "crosscurrents" such as
changing market demand, unmanageable costs or undue revenue pressures. For
example, the Fund has a lower level of exposure to traditional early-cycle
out-performers such as auto parts manufacturers.

Our larger industry exposures per the adjacent chart are utilities,
telecommunications, entertainment, healthcare and cable television, which are
less cyclical industries. The chart below is based on the Total Investments in
Senior Loans.

A COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST TRUST FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
- - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding specific issuer concentrations (as further detailed in the
accompanying Portfolio of Investments), the Fund has in the few days from
inception to period-end invested in loans to 42 borrowers in 20 industries. The
five largest individual borrower exposures in total represent $27.6 million
which is 6.3% of the net assets of the Fund. The largest borrower concentrations
include the following: Nextel (including both the Communications and Partner
Affiliates), a national wireless communication service provider, Saguaro Utility
Group, an Arizona regulated electric utility, Pinnacle Foods Holding Corp., a
national branded food products producer, Adams Outdoor Advertising, a national
billboard marketing firm and Moran Transportation, a specialty marine service
provider. Each of these borrowers have uniquely strong market share and
financial strength that, taken in a broad risk-return context, we believe
justifies our larger than average level of investment. While the Fund is on
track to become fully invested in the time frame originally anticipated, our
strategy is to reasonably increase portfolio diversity over time.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Since the Fund was in existence for only a few days prior to the end of its
fiscal year end, there is very little to discuss concerning performance. The
Fund's shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol "FCT") within a
narrow band around the $20.00 issue price reflective of standard post-issuance
price support by the underwriter. The first dividend is scheduled to be declared
in July with payment in August, both as originally anticipated. As the Fund's
equity becomes fully invested, a floating-rate leverage program will be
arranged.

We remain committed to long-term performance and appreciate the opportunity to
assist our investors in meeting their personal investment goals.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2004

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004 and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The
Fund will pursue these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets. The NAV is determined
as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"),
normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting
the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. The NAV is
computed by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses and
dividends declared but unpaid), by the total number of shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value, or in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value in
accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. A
majority of the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by
third parties. In the event that market quotations are not readily available,
the pricing service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the
valuations are deemed unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the
principal markets for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign
securities), but before the Fund values its assets, would materially affect net
asset value, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value
method in good faith to value the Fund's securities and investments. The use of
fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by
the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940
Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day of which
such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities trading on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded in the
over-the-counter market, but excluding securities trading on the NASDAQ, are
valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days
or less are valued at amortized cost.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having substantially
grown in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less liquidity
than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior Loans have
few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a specific
Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly,
determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent
and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans than
for other types of securities. Typically Senior Loans are valued using
information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by the
Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2004


REPURCHASE AGREEMENT:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligations, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.


CASH FLOW INFORMATION:

The Fund issues its shares, invests in securities, and distributes dividends
from net investment income (which are either paid in cash or reinvested at the
discretion of shareholders). These activities are reported in the Statement of
Changes in Net Assets. Information on cash payments is presented in the
Statement of Cash Flows. Accounting practices that do not affect reporting
activities on a cash basis include unrealized gain or loss on investment
securities, and accretion/amortization of discount/premium recognized on
investment securities.

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income is not accrued
until settlement date. The Fund instructs the custodian to segregate assets of
the Fund with a current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued
purchase commitments.


UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. These commitments are disclosed in the accompanying
Portfolio of Investments and Statement of Assets and Liabilities.


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the leverage. If the Fund recognizes a long-term capital
gain, it will be required to allocate such gain between the Common Shares and
preferred shares, if any, issued by the Fund in proportion to the total
dividends paid for the year. Distributions will automatically be reinvested into
additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan
unless cash distributions are elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the period ended May 31,
2004, resulting in book and tax accounting have been reclassified at year end to
reflect an increase to accumulated net investment loss by $54,602 and a decrease
to paid-in capital by $54,602. Net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

                                                                         Page 13

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2004

As of May 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis were
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income..................     $    --
Accumulated Net Capital Gains..................          --
Unrealized Depreciation........................      (480,091)


INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with
the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment income and
net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has been made for
federal or state income taxes.


EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.


COMMON SHARE ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING COSTS:

Organization costs consist of costs incurred to establish the Fund and enable it
to legally do business. These costs include incorporation fees, legal services
pertaining to the organization of the business and audit fees relating to the
initial registration and auditing the initial seed capital statement, among
other fees. Offering costs consist of legal fees pertaining to the Fund's shares
offered for sale, registration fees, underwriting fees, and printing of initial
prospectus, among other fees. First Trust and Four Corners Capital Management,
LLC ("Four Corners") have paid all organizational expenses and all offering
costs of the Fund (other than sales load) that exceed $0.04 per Common Share.
The Fund's share of Common Share offering costs, $920,000, were recorded as a
reduction of the proceeds from the sale of Common Shares.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For its
investment advisory services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee
calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average
daily gross asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and
unpaid dividends on any outstanding Preferred Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-adviser and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives a portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
out of the First Trust management fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

No officer or employee of First Trust received any compensation from the Fund
for serving as an officer or Trustee of the Fund. The Fund pays each Trustee who
is not an officer or employee of First Trust or any of their affiliates $10,000
per annum plus $1,000 per regularly scheduled meeting attended, $500 per
committee meeting attended and reimbursement for travel and out-of-pocket
expenses.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the period ended May 31, 2004, aggregated amounts
were $102,285,872 and $0, respectively.

As of May 31, 2004, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all
securities, in which there was an excess of value over tax cost, was $3,126 and
the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities, in which there
was an excess of tax cost over value, was $483,217.

                                 5. COMMON STOCK

As of May 31, 2004, 23,005,236 of $0.01 par value Common Shares were issued. An
unlimited number of Common Shares has been authorized under the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan.

                   6. PREFERRED SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

recommend that the Board of Trustees of the Fund approve an issuance of
Preferred Shares at the July 26, 2004 meeting.

                                 7. SENIOR LOANS

Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory and/or
optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions and
because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to prepay,
prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a result, the
actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's portfolio may be
substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Senior Loans generally have
maturities that range from five to eight years; however, the Fund estimates that
refinancings and prepayments result in an average maturity of the Senior Loans
held in its portfolio is generally between 18-36 months.

Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates, which
are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered by
one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United States banks
or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are generally considered
to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is contractually obligated to
receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or Borrower prior to the disposition of
a Senior Loan.

                      8. REVOLVING SECURITIZATION FACILITY

Management of the Fund intends to recommend to the Board of Trustees at its July
26, 2004 meeting, that the Fund enter into a revolving securitization facility
among the Fund and certain primary and secondary lenders, which would provide
for a revolving credit facility to be used as leverage for the Fund. The credit
facility would provide for a secured line of credit for the Fund where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the requirements of
the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have an
"asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after
borrowings). The total commitment under the facility is expected to be up to
$175,000,000. There are no borrowings outstanding under a revolving
securitization facility as of May 31, 2004.


                                                                         Page 15

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR
FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate
Income Fund II (the "Fund"), as of May 31, 2004 and the related statements of
operations, changes in net assets, cash flows and the financial highlights for
the period May 18, 2004 (inception) through May 31, 2004. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of May 31, 2004, by correspondence with the
Funds' custodian, brokers and selling or agent banks; where replies were not
received, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Fund at May 31, 2004, the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and cash flows, and the financial highlights for the period May 18, 2004
(inception) through May 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect to receive cash distributions,
all dividends, including any capital gain distributions, on your Common Shares
will be automatically reinvested by PFPC (the "Plan Agent"), in additional
Common Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you
will receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by
PFPC, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

           (1) If the Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value at
               the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
               equal to the greater of (i) net asset value per Common Share on
               that date or (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

           (2) If the Common Shares are trading below net asset value at the
               time of valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or
               distribution in cash and will purchase Common Shares in the open
               market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts.
               It is possible that the market price for the Common Shares may
               increase before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases.
               Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the Plan
               Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation,
               resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or
               distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund.
               The Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions received
               in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30
               days of the valuation date except where temporary curtailment or
               suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with federal
               securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
               payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Plan
Agent, or by telephone in accordance with such reasonable requirements as the
Plan Agent and Fund may agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated,
you will receive a certificate for each whole share in your account under the
Plan and you will receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your
account. If you wish, the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the
proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders accounts in the Plan and gives written
confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information you may
need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan
Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each participant
any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held only in
accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will include
all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

         (e)(1)  Disclose  the  audit  committee's   pre-approval  policies  and
procedures described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

responsible for the  pre-approval of all audit services and permitted  non-audit
services  (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Fund by
its  independent  auditors.  The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give
such  pre-approvals  on  behalf  of the  Committee  and  shall  report  any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

         The Committee is also  responsible  for the approval of the independent

sub-contracted  or  overseen  by  another  investment  adviser)  and any  entity

sub-contracted  with or overseen by another  investment  adviser) and any entity
controlling,  controlled by or under common control with the investment  adviser
that provides ongoing  services to the Fund that were not pre-approved  pursuant
to the DE MINIMIS  exception,  the Committee will consider whether the provision
of such non-audit services is compatible with the auditor's independence.

                              PROXY VOTER SERVICES
                  PROXY VOTING POLICY STATEMENT AND GUIDELINES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This statement sets forth the proxy voting policy of Proxy Voter Services (PVS).
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has stated that the fiduciary act of managing
plan assets that are shares of  corporate  stock  includes the voting of proxies
appurtenant to those shares of stock and that trustees may delegate this duty to
an investment manager.  ERISA section 3(38) defines an investment manager as any
fiduciary  who is  registered  as an  investment  adviser  under the  Investment
Advisor Act of 1940. PVS is a registered investment adviser under the Investment
Advisor Act of 1940.

PVS shall  vote the  proxies  of its  clients  solely in the  interest  of their
participants  and  beneficiaries  and for the  exclusive  purpose  of  providing
benefits to them. PVS shall not subordinate  the interests of  participants  and
beneficiaries  to  unrelated  objectives.  PVS shall  act with the care,  skill,
prudence,  and diligence under the circumstances  then prevailing that a prudent
man acting in a like  capacity and familiar  with such matters  would use in the
conduct of an  enterprise of a like  character and with like aims.  When proxies
due to PVS's clients have not been received, PVS will make reasonable efforts to
obtain missing  proxies.  PVS is not  responsible for voting proxies it does not
receive.

PVS shall analyze each proxy on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, informed by the guidelines
elaborated below, subject to the requirement that all votes shall be cast solely
in the long-term  interest of the participants  and  beneficiaries of the plans.
PVS does not intend for these  guidelines to be  exhaustive.  Hundreds of issues
appear on proxy ballots every year,  and it is neither  practical nor productive
to fashion  voting  guidelines  and  policies  which  attempt  to address  every
eventuality. Rather, PVS's guidelines are intended to cover the most significant
and frequent proxy issues that arise. Issues not covered by the guidelines shall
be voted in the interest of the participants and  beneficiaries of the plan. PVS
shall revise its guidelines as events warrant.

PVS shall  report  annually to its clients on proxy votes cast on their  behalf.
These  proxy  voting  reports  will   demonstrate   PVS's  compliance  with  its
responsibilities  and will facilitate clients' monitoring of PVS. A copy of this
PROXY VOTING POLICY  STATEMENT AND  GUIDELINES is provided to each client at the
time PVS is retained.  PVS shall provide its clients with revised copies of this
proxy voting policy statement and guidelines whenever significant revisions have
been made.

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                          Page 4

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Electing  directors  is the single most  important  stock  ownership  right that
shareholders  can  exercise.  By  electing  directors  who  share  their  views,
shareholders can help to define  performance  standards against which management
can be held accountable.

According to the REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS' BLUE
RIBBON COMMISSION ON DIRECTOR  PROFESSIONALISM  (1996): "The accepted governance
paradigm  is simple:  management  is  accountable  to the board and the board is
accountable to  shareholders...  In the view of the  Commission,  the board does
more than  mechanically  link those who manage the corporation and those who own
it... Rather, as a surrogate for dispersed  ownership,  the board is at the very
center of corporate governance itself."

PVS  holds  directors  to  a  high  standard  when  voting  on  their  election,
qualifications,  and  compensation.  PVS  will  evaluate  directors  fairly  and
objectively,  rewarding  them for  significant  contributions  and holding  them
ultimately accountable to shareholders for corporate performance.  Institutional
investors  should use their voting rights in uncontested  elections to influence
financial   performance  and  corporate   strategies  for  achieving  long  term
shareholder value.

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN UNCONTESTED  ELECTIONS

Votes  concerning the entire board of directors are examined using the following
five factors:

o Poor long-term corporate performance record relative to its peer index and S&P
500;
o Lack of majority of independent  directors or  independence  of the full board
and key board committees (fully independent audit, compensation,  and nominating
committees);
o Diversity of board;
o Executive compensation related (excessive  salaries/bonuses/pensions,  history
of repricing  underwater  stock  options,  imprudent  use of company  resources,
misallocation of corporate assets, etc.); and
o Failure of the board to  properly  respond to  majority  votes on  shareholder
proposals.

Votes on individual director nominees are made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis. Votes on
individual   directors  are  examined  using  the  following  eight  factors:

o Attendance of director  nominees at board  meetings of less than 75 percent in
one year without valid reason or explanation;
o Lack of independence on key board committees (i.e.  audit,  compensation,  and
nominating  committees);
o Failure to establish any key board committees (i.e.  audit,  compensation,  or
nominating);

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                          Page 5


<PAGE>

o  Directors  serving  on an  excessive  number  of  other  boards  which  could
compromise their duties of care and loyalty;
o Chapter 7 bankruptcy, SEC violations, and criminal investigations;
o Interlocking directorships;
o Performance of compensation  committee members related to egregious  executive
compensation; and
o Performance of audit committee members concerning excessive non-audit fees and
the presence of auditor ratification upon the proxy ballot.

VOTING FOR  DIRECTOR  NOMINEES IN  CONTESTED  ELECTIONS

Contested  elections of  directors  frequently  occur when a board  candidate or
"dissident  slate" seeks  election  for the purpose of  achieving a  significant
change in corporate  policy or control of seats on the board.  Competing  slates
will be evaluated on a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis with a number of  considerations  in
mind.  These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,  the  following:   personal
qualifications  of each candidate;  the economic impact of the policies advanced
by the  dissident  slate of  nominees;  and  their  expressed  and  demonstrated
commitment  to the  interests of the  shareholders  of the  company.

Votes in a contested election of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis
with the following seven factors in consideration:

o  Long-term  financial  performance  of  the  target  company  relative  to its
industry;
o Management's historical track record;
o Background to the proxy contest;
o Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);
o  Evaluation  of  what  each  side  is  offering  shareholders  as  well as the
likelihood  that the  proposed  objectives  and  goals in  these  proposals  are
realistic,  achievable,  demonstrable and viable under the current conditions by
which the company operates;
o Equity ownership positions; and
o Total impact on all stakeholders.

CEO  SERVING  AS  CHAIRMAN

Arguments have been made that a smaller company and its shareholders can benefit
from the  full-time  attention of a joint  chairman  and CEO.  This may be so in
select cases (and indeed,  using a case-by-case  review of circumstances,  there
may be worthy exceptions). But, even in these cases, it is our general view that
a person  should  only  serve in the  position  of joint CEO and  chairman  on a
temporary  basis.  Once a company  reaches a point of maturity,  these positions
should be separated.  Clearly, the prevalence of joint CEO/chairman positions in
boardrooms has stretched well beyond the small-cap universe of companies. Today,
roughly 60 percent of  companies  in both the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 fall into
this category.

                                                     U.S.Policy  and  Guidelines
                                                                          Page 6

We strongly  believe that the potential for conflicts of interest in the board's
supervisory  and oversight  duties trumps any possible  corollary  benefits that
could ensue from a dual  CEO/chairman  scenario.  Instead of having an ingrained
quid pro quo  situation  whereby a company has a single leader  overseeing  both
management and the boardroom, we believe that it is the board's implicit duty to
assume an impartial  and  objective  role in  overseeing  the  executive  team's
overall performance.  Shareholder interests are placed in jeopardy if the CEO of
a company is required to report to a board that she/he also chairs.  Inherent in
the chairman's job description is the duty to assess the CEO's performance. This
objectivity is obviously  compromised when a chairman is in charge of evaluating
her/his own performance.  Moreover,  the unification of chairman and CEO poses a
direct threat to the smooth  functioning of the entire board process since it is
the  ultimate  responsibility  of the  chairman  to set the  agenda,  facilitate
discussion,   and  make  sure  that  directors  are  given  complete  access  to
information in order to make informed decisions.

Two major  components at the top of every public  company are the running of the
board  and  the  executive  responsibility  for  the  running  of the  company's
business. Without doubt, there should be a clear division of responsibilities at
the head of the company that will ensure a balance of power and authority,  such
that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision. When there is no clear
division  between the executive and board branches of a company,  poor executive
and/or  board  actions   often  go  unchecked  to  the  ultimate   detriment  of
shareholders.1

In the past, we have  supported  shareholder  proposals  calling to separate the
positions  of CEO and  chairman.  Our  revised  policy2  is based upon this very
principle  and  is  merely  an  extension  of  this  tenet  of  sound  corporate
governance.

o  Generally  WITHHOLD  votes  from a CEO who is  also  serving  in the  role of
chairman at the same company.
o Generally support shareholder  proposals calling for the separation of the CEO
and chairman positions.
o Generally support shareholder  proposals calling for a non-executive  director
to serve as chairman  who is not a former CEO or  senior-level  executive of the
company.


INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS

PVS believes that a board  independent from management is of vital importance to
a company  and its  shareholders.  Accordingly,  PVS will cast votes in a manner
that shall encourage the independence of boards.  Independence will be evaluated
based  upon a number of  factors,  including:  employment  by the  company or an
affiliate in an executive capacity; past or current employment by a firm that is
one of the company's paid advisors

or   consultants;   personal   services   contract  with  the  company;   family
relationships of an executive or director of the company;  interlocks with other
companies on which the company's  chairman or chief executive  officer is also a
board  member;   and  service  with  a  non-profit  that  receives   significant
contributions from the company.

o  Generally  support  shareholder  proposals  that  request  that the  board be
comprised of a majority of independent directors.
o Vote FOR shareholder  proposals requesting that the key board committees (i.e.
audit,   compensation   and/or   nominating)   include   independent   directors
exclusively.
o Vote AGAINST boards with a majority insider board composition.

DIRECTOR DIVERSITY

We support gender and ethnic diversity as an important  component of a company's
board.  Diversity brings different perspectives to a board that in turn leads to
a more varied approach to board issues. We believe that increasing  diversity in
the boardroom to better reflect a company's workforce,  customers, and community
enhances shareholder value.

o Support  proposals  asking  the board to make  greater  efforts  to search for
qualified  female  and  minority  candidates  for  nomination  to the  board  of
directors.
o Support endorsement of a policy of board inclusiveness.
o Support reporting to shareholders on a company's efforts to increase diversity
on their boards.

STOCK OWNERSHIP  REQUIREMENTS

Corporate  directors  should own some amount of stock of the  companies on which
they serve as board  members.  Stock  ownership is a simple  method to align the
interests of  directors  with company  shareholders.  Nevertheless,  many highly
qualified  individuals  such as  academics  and  clergy  who can offer  valuable
perspectives  in board  rooms  may be unable to  purchase  individual  shares of
stock.  In such a circumstance,  the preferred  solution is to look at the board
nominees individually and take stock ownership into consideration when voting on
the merits of each candidate.

o Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring directors to own a minimum amount
of company  stock in order to qualify as a director  nominee or to remain on the
board.

BOARD  STRUCTURE

The  ability  to  elect  directors  is  the  single  most  important  use of the
shareholder  franchise,  and all directors  should be  accountable  on an annual
basis.   Annually  elected  boards  provide  the  best  governance   system  for
accountability to shareholders. A classified board

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                          Page 8


<PAGE>

is a board  that is  divided  into  separate  classes,  with  directors  serving
overlapping  terms. A company with a classified  board usually divides the board
into three  classes.  Under this system,  only one class of nominees comes up to
shareholder vote at the AGM each year.

As  a  consequence  of  these  staggered  terms,   shareholders  only  have  the
opportunity to vote on a single director approximately once every three years. A
classified  board makes it  difficult to change  control of the board  through a
proxy  contest  since it would  normally  take two  years to gain  control  of a
majority of board seats. Under a classified board, the possibility of management
entrenchment greatly increases.

Many in  management  believe that  staggered  boards  provide  continuity.  Some
shareholders  believe  that in  certain  cases a  staggered  board  can  provide
consistency and continuity in regard to decision-making  and commitment that may
be important to the long-term financial future of the company.

Nevertheless,  empirical  evidence suggests that staggered boards may not in all
cases be in the  shareholders  best interests.  A classified  board can entrench
management and effectively preclude most takeover bids or proxy contests.

o Vote AGAINST classified boards when the issue comes up for vote.

LIMIT TERM OF OFFICE

Those who support term limits argue that this requirement  would bring new ideas
and  approaches  on to a board.  Here  again we prefer to look at  directors  as
individuals  rather  than  impose  a  strict  rule.

o Generally  vote AGAINST  shareholder  proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

Most  corporations  provide that  shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for
each share owned.  Under a cumulative voting scheme the shareholder is permitted
to have one vote per share for each  director  to be elected.  Shareholders  are
permitted  to  apportion  those votes in any manner they wish among the director
candidates. Shareholders have the opportunity to elect a minority representative
to a board through  cumulative voting,  thereby ensuring  representation for all
sizes of shareholders.

For  example,  if there is a company  with a  ten-member  board  and 500  shares
outstanding--the total number of votes that may be cast is 5,000. In this case a
shareholder  with 51 shares (10.2  percent of the  outstanding  shares) would be
guaranteed  one board  seat  because  all  votes may be cast for one  candidate.
Without cumulative voting, anyone controlling 51 percent of shares would control
the election of all ten directors.

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                          Page 9


<PAGE>

Shareholders  need to have flexibility in supporting  candidates for a company's
board of directors.  This is the only mechanism that minority  shareholders  can
use to be  represented  on a  company's  board.

o Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate cumulative voting.
o Vote FOR proposals to permit cumulative voting.


DIRECTOR  AND  OFFICER   INDEMNIFICATION  AND  LIABILITY  PROTECTION

Management  proposals typically seek shareholder  approval to adopt an amendment
to the  company's  charter  to  eliminate  or limit the  personal  liability  of
directors  to the  company and its  shareholders  for  monetary  damages for any
breach of  fiduciary  duty to the  fullest  extent  permitted  by state law.  In
contrast,  shareholder proposals seek to provide for personal monetary liability
for fiduciary breaches arising from gross negligence.  While PVS recognizes that
a company may have a more difficult time  attracting and retaining  directors if
they are  subject  to  personal  monetary  liability,  PVS  believes  the  great
responsibility and authority of directors justifies holding them accountable for
their actions.

Each proposal  addressing  director liability will be evaluated  consistent with
this philosophy.  PVS may support these proposals when the company  persuasively
argues that such action is  necessary to attract and retain  directors,  but PVS
may often oppose management proposals and support shareholder proposals in light
of our philosophy of promoting director accountability.

o Vote AGAINST  proposals to limit or  eliminate  entirely  director and officer
liability  in  regards  to:  (i)  breach of the  director's  fiduciary  "duty of
loyalty" to  shareholders;  (ii) acts or  omissions  not made in "good faith" or
involving intentional misconduct or knowledge of violations under the law; (iii)
acts involving the unlawful  purchases or redemptions of stock;  (iv) payment of
unlawful  dividends;  or (v) use of the  position  as  director  for  receipt of
improper personal benefits.

INDEMNIFICATION

Indemnification  is the payment by a company of the  expenses of  directors  who
become  involved  in  litigation  as a result  of their  service  to a  company.
Proposals to indemnify a company's  directors  differ from those to eliminate or
reduce their  liability  because  with  indemnification  directors  may still be
liable for an act or omission,  but the company  will bear the expense.  PVS may
support these proposals when the company persuasively argues that such action is
necessary  to  attract  and  retain   directors,   but  will  generally   oppose
indemnification  when it is being  proposed to insulate  directors  from actions
they have already taken.

<PAGE>

o Vote AGAINST  indemnification  proposals that would expand individual coverage
beyond  ordinary legal expenses to also cover specific acts of negligence  which
exceed the  standard of mere  carelessness  that is  regularly  covered in board
fiduciary  indemnification.
o Vote FOR only those proposals which provide expanded  coverage in cases when a
director's or officer's legal defense was  unsuccessful if: (1) the director was
found to have acted in good faith and in a manner  that he  reasonably  believed
was in the best interests of the company;  and (2) only if the director's  legal
expenses would be covered.

POISON PILLS

Shareholder  rights plans,  typically  known as poison  pills,  take the form of
rights or warrants  issued to  shareholders  and are triggered  when a potential
acquiring stockholder reaches a certain threshold of ownership.  When triggered,
poison pills  generally  allow  shareholders  to purchase  shares from,  or sell
shares  back to, the  target  company  ("flip-in  pill")  and/or  the  potential
acquirer ("flip-out pill") at a price far out of line with fair market value.

Depending on the type of pill, the triggering  event can either  transfer wealth
from the target company or dilute the equity  holdings of current  shareholders.
Poison  pills  insulate  management  from the threat of a change in control  and
provide the target  board with veto power over  takeover  bids.  Because  poison
pills greatly alter the balance of power between  shareholders  and  management,
shareholders  should be allowed to make their own  evaluation  of such plans.

o Vote FOR  shareholder  proposals  that ask a company to submit its poison pill
for shareholder ratification.
o Review on a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis  shareholder  proposals to redeem a company's
poison pill.
o Review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis management proposals to ratify a poison pill.
o Votes  should  be  WITHHELD  from any  board  where a  dead-hand  poison  pill
provision is in place. From a shareholder perspective, there is no justification
for a dead-hand  provision.  Directors of companies with these lethal protective
devices should be held accountable.

GREENMAIL

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from  individuals  or groups  seeking  control  of the  company.  Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market
value of shares,  the practice  discriminates  against most  shareholders.  This
transferred cash, absent the greenmail payment,  could be put to much better use
for reinvestment in the company, payment of dividends, or to fund a public share
repurchase program.

o Vote FOR  proposals to adopt an  anti-greenmail  provision in their charter or
bylaws  that would  thereby  restrict  a  company's  ability  to make  greenmail
payments to certain shareholders.
o Review on a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis all  anti-greenmail  proposals  when they are
presented as bundled items with other charter or bylaw amendments.

<PAGE>

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO REMOVE DIRECTORS

Shareholder  ability  to remove  directors,  with or  without  cause,  is either
prescribed by a state's business  corporation law, individual company's articles
of  incorporation,   or  its  corporate  bylaws.   Many  companies  have  sought
shareholder  approval for charter or bylaw  amendments  that would  prohibit the
removal of directors except for cause, thus ensuring that directors would retain
their  directorship for their full-term unless found guilty of self-dealing.  By
requiring cause to be demonstrated through due process, management insulates the
directors  from  removal  even if a director  has been  performing  poorly,  not
attending meetings, or not acting in the best interests of shareholders.

o Vote AGAINST  proposals  that provide that  directors  may be removed only for
cause.
o Vote FOR  proposals  which seek to restore the  authority of  shareholders  to
remove directors with or without cause.
o Vote  AGAINST  proposals  that  provide only  continuing  directors  may elect
replacements to fill board vacancies.
o Vote FOR proposals that permit  shareholders  to elect directors to fill board
vacancies.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ALTER THE SIZE OF THE BOARD

Proposals  which would allow  management to increase or decrease the size of the
board at its own discretion  are often used by companies as a takeover  defense.
PVS  supports  management  proposals  to fix the size of the board at a specific
number,  thus preventing  management when facing a proxy context from increasing
the board size  without  shareholder  approval.  By  increasing  the size of the
board,  management  can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of
the board. Fixing the size of the board also prevents a reduction in the size of
the board as a strategy to oust  independent  directors.  Fixing board size also
prevents  management  from increasing the number of directors in order to dilute
the effects of cumulative voting.

o Vote FOR proposals that seek to fix the size of the board.
o Vote AGAINST  proposals that give  management the ability to alter the size of
the board without shareholder approval.

                                    AUDITORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUDITOR  RATIFICATION

The ratification of auditors is an important  component of good governance.  The
wave of recent  accounting  scandals at companies  illuminate the need to ensure
auditor  independence  in the  face of  selling  consulting  services  to  audit
clients.  At the Big Five (now  Final  Four)  accounting  firms,  revenues  from
non-audit  services  grew  from 13% of total  revenues  in 1981 to half of total
revenue in 2000.  A recent  study of over 1,200 US companies in the S&P 500, Mid
Cap, and Small Cap indices  found that 72% of fees paid to auditors in 2002 were
for  non-audit  services,  exactly the same level as 2001.  We believe  that the
ratio  should  be  reversed,  and that  non-audit  fees  should  make up no more
one-quarter  of all fees paid to the auditor so as to properly  discourage  even
the appearance of any undue influence upon an auditor's objectivity.

As  auditors  are the  backbone  upon  which a  company's  financial  health  is
measured,  auditor  independence is absolutely essential for rendering objective
opinions  upon  which  investors  then rely.  When an auditor is paid  excessive
consulting  fees in  addition  to fees paid for  auditing,  the  company/auditor
relationship is left open to conflicts of interest.  Because accounting scandals
evaporate  shareholder  value,  any proposal to ratify  auditors is examined for
potential conflicts of interest,  with particular  attention to the fees paid to
the auditor.

o Vote FOR  proposals to ratify  auditors when the amount of audit fees is equal
to or greater  than three times the amount paid for  consulting,  unless:  i) an
auditor has a financial  interest in or  association  with the  company,  and is
therefore  not  independent;  or  ii)  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the
independent  auditor  has  rendered  an opinion  which is neither  accurate  nor
indicative of the company's financial position.
o Vote  AGAINST  proposals to ratify  auditors  when the amount of audit fees is
less than three times greater than that for consulting fees.
o WITHHOLD votes from Audit  Committee  members in cases where  consulting  fees
exceed audit fees.
o Generally support shareholder proposals to ensure auditor independence through
measures such as mandatory  auditor  rotation (no less than every five years) or
prohibiting companies from buying consulting services from their auditor.

                            MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Votes on mergers and acquisitions are considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, taking
into  account  at least the  following:

o Impact of the merger on shareholder value;
o Anticipated  financial  and operating  benefits  realizable  through  combined
synergies;
o Offer price (cost vs. premium).
o Financial viability of the combined companies as a single entity;
o Was the deal put  together in good  faith?  Were  negotiations  carried out at
arm's length?  Was any portion of the process  tainted by possible  conflicts of
interest?;
o Fairness opinion (or lack thereof);
o Changes in corporate governance and their impact on shareholder rights; and
o Impact on community stakeholders and employees in both workforces.


FAIR  PRICE  PROVISIONS

Fair price  provisions were originally  designed to specifically  defend against
the most coercive of takeover devises-- the two-tiered,  front-end loaded tender
offer. In such a hostile  takeover,  the bidder offers cash for enough shares to
gain  control of the target.  At the same time,  the  acquirer  states that once
control has been obtained,  the target's remaining shares will be purchased with
cash, cash and securities, or only securities. Since the payment offered for the
remaining  stock is, by design,  less valuable  than the original  offer for the
controlling  shares,  shareholders  are forced to sell out early to maximize the
value of their shares.  Standard fair price provisions  require that-- absent of
board or  shareholder  approval  of the  acquisition--  the bidder  must pay the
remaining shareholders the same price for their shares that brought control.

o Vote FOR fair price  proposals  as long as the  shareholder  vote  requirement
embedded in the provision is no more than a majority of disinterested shares.
o Vote FOR shareholder  proposals to lower the shareholder  vote  requirement in
existing fair price provisions.

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING

Votes  concerning   corporate   restructuring   proposals,   including  minority
squeezeouts,  leveraged buyouts, spin-offs,  liquidations,  and asset sales, are
considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

APPRAISAL  RIGHTS

Rights of  appraisal  provide  shareholders  who do not  approve of the terms of
certain corporate transactions the right to demand a judicial review in order to
determine the fair

<PAGE>

value for their  shares.  The right of  appraisal  applies to  mergers,  sale of
corporate  assets,  and charter  amendments  that may have a materially  adverse
effect on the rights of dissenting shareholders.

o Vote FOR  proposals  to  restore  or  provide  shareholders  with the right of
appraisal.

SPIN-OFFS

Votes on spin-offs are considered on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis  depending on the tax
and  regulatory  advantages,  planned use of sale  proceeds,  market focus,  and
managerial incentives.

ASSET SALES

Votes on asset  sales are made on a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis after  considering  the
impact on the balance sheet/working  capital,  value received for the asset, and
potential elimination of diseconomies.

LIQUIDATIONS

Votes  on  liquidations  are  made  on  a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis  after  reviewing
management's  efforts to pursue other  alternatives,  appraisal value of assets,
and the compensation plan for executives managing the liquidation.

CHANGING CORPORATE NAME

Vote FOR changing the corporate  name in all instances if proposed and supported
by management.

                               SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIDENTIAL  VOTING

The confidential ballot ensures that voters are not subject to real or perceived
coercion.  In an open voting  system,  management  can  determine  who has voted
against  its  nominees  or  proposals  before a final vote  count.  As a result,
shareholders  can be pressured to vote with  management at companies  with which
they maintain or would like to establish a business relationship.

o Vote FOR shareholder proposals that request corporations to adopt confidential
voting, use independent  tabulators,  and use independent inspectors of election
as long as the proposals  include clauses for proxy contests as follows:  in the
case of a  contested  election,  management  is  permitted  to request  that the
dissident group honor its confidential  voting policy.  If the dissidents agree,
the policy remains in place.  If the dissidents do not agree,  the  confidential
voting policy is waived.

o Vote FOR management proposals to adopt confidential voting procedures.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

Most state  corporation  statutes allow  shareholders to call a
special  meeting  when they want to take  action on certain  matters  that arise
between regularly  scheduled annual meetings.  Sometimes this right applies only
if a  shareholder  or a group of  shareholders  own a  specified  percentage  of
shares,  with ten  percent  being  the most  common.  Shareholders  may lose the
ability to remove directors,  initiate a shareholder resolution, or respond to a
beneficial  offer without having to wait for the next scheduled  meeting if they
are unable to act at a special  meeting  of their own  calling.

o Vote  AGAINST  proposals to restrict or prohibit  shareholder  ability to call
special meetings.
o Vote FOR proposals that remove  restrictions  on the right of  shareholders to
act independently of management.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Consent  solicitations  allow shareholders to vote on and respond to shareholder
and management  proposals by mail without having to act at a physical meeting. A
consent  card is sent by mail  for  shareholder  approval  and only  requires  a
signature for action.  Some  corporate  bylaws require  supermajority  votes for
consents, while at others standard annual meeting rules apply.  Shareholders may
lose the ability to remove  directors,  initiate a  shareholder  resolution,  or
respond to a  beneficial  offer  without  having to wait for the next  scheduled
meeting if they are unable to act at a special meeting of their own calling.

o Vote FOR  proposals  to allow or make  easier  shareholder  action by  written
consent.

EQUAL  ACCESS

The process for electing  directors  can be improved  since a company  currently
nominates  for  election  only  one  candidate  for  each  board  seat,  leaving
shareholders with no practical choice in most director  elections.  Shareholders
who  oppose a  candidate  have no easy way to do so unless  they are  willing to
undertake the considerable  expense of running an independent  candidate for the
board. The current system is that of a truly limited  democracy,  whereby voters
are not given a choice of multiple  candidates  for each  directorship,  but are
only allowed to register their approval or disapproval of one candidate for each
director's  seat. The only way to register dissent about a given candidate is to
withhold support from that nominee.  Truly democratic  director elections should
offer a choice,  thereby allowing a far healthier and more rigorous  shareholder
evaluation and debate about which specific  nominees are best qualified.  A more
open and rigorous  election process would give shareholders an actual choice and
give them far greater say in choosing the directors most able to represent their
interests.

o  Vote  FOR  shareholder   proposals  that  would  allow  significant   company
shareholders  equal access to  management's  proxy material in order to evaluate
and propose voting recommendations on proxy proposals and director nominees, and
in order to nominate their own candidates to the board.

UNEQUAL VOTING RIGHTS

Incumbent managers are able to use unequal voting rights through the creation of
a separate  class of shares  which  have  superior  voting  rights to the common
shares  of  regular   shareholders.   This   separate   class  of  shares   with
disproportionate  voting power allows  management to  concentrate  its power and
insulate  itself  from the wishes of the  majority of  shareholders.  Dual class
exchange  offers  involve  a  transfer  of  voting  rights  from  one  group  of
shareholders to another group of shareholders typically through the payment of a
preferential  dividend. A dual class  recapitalization plan also establishes two
classes of common stock with unequal  voting rights,  but initially  involves an
equal  distribution  of  preferential  and  inferior  voting  shares to  current
shareholders.

o Vote FOR resolutions that seek to maintain or convert to a one share, one vote
capital structure.
o Vote AGAINST  requests for the creation or  continuation of dual class capital
structures or the creation of new or additional super-voting shares.

SUPERMAJORITY  SHAREHOLDER  VOTE  REQUIREMENT  TO AMEND  THE  CHARTER  OR BYLAWS

Supermajority  shareholder vote requirements for charter or bylaw amendments are
often the result of "lock-in" votes,  which are the votes required to repeal new
provisions  to the  corporate  charter.  Supermajority  provisions  violate  the
principle  that a  simple  majority  of  voting  shares  should  be all  that is
necessary  to effect  change  regarding a company and its  corporate  governance
provisions.  Requiring more than this may entrench  managers by blocking actions
that  are in the best  interests  of  shareholders.

o Vote AGAINST management proposals to require a supermajority  shareholder vote
to approve charter and bylaw amendments.
o Vote AGAINST management  proposals seeking to lower supermajority  shareholder
vote requirements  when they accompany  management  sponsored  proposals to also
change certain charter or bylaw amendments.
o Vote  FOR  shareholder  proposals  to  lower  supermajority  shareholder  vote
requirements for charter and bylaw amendments.

SUPERMAJORITY  SHAREHOLDER  VOTE  REQUIREMENT  TO  APPROVE  MERGERS

Supermajority  provisions violate the principle that a simple majority of voting
shares should be all that is necessary to effect change  regarding a company and
its  corporate  governance  provisions.  Requiring  more than this may  entrench
managers by blocking actions that are in the best interests of  shareholders.

o Vote AGAINST management proposals to require a supermajority  shareholder vote
to approve mergers and other significant business combinations.
o Vote  FOR  shareholder  proposals  to  lower  supermajority  shareholder  vote
requirements for mergers and other significant business combinations.

REIMBURSE PROXY  SOLICITATION  EXPENSES

Decisions to provide full  reimbursement  for dissidents  waging a proxy contest
are made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

                                CAPITAL STRUCTURE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  management  of a  corporation's  capital  structure  involves  a number  of
important issues including dividend policy,  types of assets,  opportunities for
growth,  ability to finance new projects  internally,  and the cost of obtaining
additional  capital.  Many  financing  decisions  have a  significant  impact on
shareholder  value,  particularly  when they involve the issuance of  additional
common  stock,  preferred  stock,  or debt.

COMMON  STOCK  AUTHORIZATION

State statutes and stock exchanges require shareholder approval for increases in
the number of common shares.  Corporations increase their supply of common stock
for a variety of ordinary business purposes:  raising new capital, funding stock
compensation programs, business acquisitions, implementation of stock splits, or
payment of stock dividends.

PVS supports management  proposals  requesting  shareholder approval to increase
authorized common stock when management  provides  persuasive  justification for
the increase. For example, PVS will support increases in authorized common stock
to fund stock splits that are in shareholders' interests. PVS will evaluate on a
CASE-BY-CASE  basis on proposals when the company  intends to use the additional
stock to implement a poison pill or other  takeover  defense.  PVS will evaluate
the amount of  additional  stock  requested in comparison to the requests of the
company's peers as well as the company's articulated reason for the increase.

o Review on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis  proposals to increase the number of shares of
common stock authorized for issue.
o Vote AGAINST proposed common stock  authorizations  that increase the existing
authorization  by more than 50 percent unless a clear need for the excess shares
is presented by the company.

REVERSE STOCK SPLITS

Reverse splits  exchange  multiple  shares for a lesser amount to increase share
price.  Increasing  share price is  sometimes  necessary  to restore a company's
share  price to a level  that will allow it to be traded on the  national  stock
exchanges. In addition, some brokerage houses have a policy of not monitoring or
investing in very low priced  shares.  Reverse  stock  splits can help  maintain
stock liquidity.

We will review  management  proposals  to  implement a reverse  stock split on a
CASE-BY-CASE  basis,  taking  into  account  whether  there  is a  corresponding
proportional  decrease in authorized shares. We will generally support a reverse
stock split if management provides a reasonable  justification for the split and
reduces  authorized  shares  accordingly.  Without a corresponding  decrease,  a
reverse  stock  split is  effectively

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 20
<PAGE>

an increase in  authorized  shares by reducing the number of shares  outstanding
while  leaving  the number of  authorized  shares to be issued at the  pre-split
level.

BLANK CHECK PREFERRED  AUTHORIZATION

Preferred stock is an equity security which has certain features similar to debt
instruments--  such as fixed dividend payments and seniority of claims to common
stock-- and usually carries little to no voting rights. The terms of blank check
preferred  stock  give the  board of  directors  the  power to issue  shares  of
preferred stock at their discretion with voting, conversion,  distribution,  and
other  rights  to be  determined  by the  board at time of  issue.  Blank  check
preferred stock can be used for sound corporate purposes but can also be used as
a device to thwart hostile takeovers without shareholder approval.

o Vote FOR  proposals  to create blank check  preferred  stock in cases when the
company  expressly  states that the stock will not be used as a takeover defense
or carry superior voting rights.
o Review on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis proposals that would authorize the creation of
new classes of preferred stock with unspecified  voting,  conversion,  dividend,
distribution, and other rights.
o Review on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis proposals to increase the number of authorized
blank check preferred  shares. If the company does not have any preferred shares
outstanding, we will vote AGAINST the requested increase.
o Vote FOR shareholder proposals to have blank check preferred stock placements,
other than those  shares  issued  for the  purpose of raising  capital or making
acquisitions  in the  normal  course  of  business,  submitted  for  shareholder
ratification.

ADJUST PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK

Stock that has a fixed per share value that is on its  certificate is called par
value  stock.  The  purpose  of par  value  stock is to  establish  the  maximum
responsibility  of a  stockholder  in  the  event  that  a  corporation  becomes
insolvent.  Proposals  to  reduce  par  value  come  from  certain  state  level
requirements   for  regulatory   industries   such  as  banks  and  other  legal
requirements relating to the payment of dividends.

o Vote FOR management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock.

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

Preemptive rights permit shareholders to share proportionately in any new issues
of stock of the same class.  These rights  guarantee  existing  shareholders the
first opportunity to purchase shares of new issues of stock in the same class as
their own and in the same  proportion.  The absence of these  rights could cause
stockholders' interest in a company

<PAGE>

to be reduced by the sale of additional  shares  without their  knowledge and at
prices unfavorable to them.  Preemptive rights,  however,  can make it difficult
for corporations to issue large blocks of stock for general corporate  purposes.
Both corporations and shareholders benefit when corporations are able to arrange
issues without preemptive rights that do not result in a substantial transfer of
control.

o Review on a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis  proposals  to create or  abolish  preemptive
rights. In evaluating  proposals on preemptive  rights, we look at the size of a
company and the characteristics of its shareholder base.

DEBT  RESTRUCTURING

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis proposals to increase common and/or preferred
shares and to issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan. We consider the
following issues:

o  DILUTION:  How much will  ownership  interests  of existing  shareholders  be
reduced and how extreme will dilution to any future earnings be?
o CHANGE IN CONTROL:  Will the transaction result in a change-in-control  of the
company?
o  BANKRUPTCY:  How real is the threat of  bankruptcy?  Is  bankruptcy  the main
factor driving the debt restructuring? Would  the restructuring result in severe
loss to shareholder value?
o POSSIBLE  SELF-DEALINGS:  Generally  approve  proposals that  facilitate  debt
restructuring unless there are clear signs of self-dealing or other abuses.

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 22

                                  COMPENSATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STOCK OPTION PLANS

PVS supports  compensating  executives  at a reasonable  rate and believes  that
executive  compensation  should  be  strongly  correlated  to  performance.  PVS
supports stock options as a significant component of compensation.  Stock option
and other forms of compensation should be  performance-based  with an eye toward
improving  shareholder  value.   Well-designed  stock  option  plans  align  the
interests of executives and  shareholders by providing that  executives  benefit
when stock prices rise as the company--  and  shareholders--  prosper  together.

Many  plans  sponsored  by  management  provide  goals so easily  attained  that
executives  can realize  massive  rewards even though  shareholder  value is not
necessarily  created.  PVS will support  option plans that provide  legitimately
challenging  performance  targets that serve to truly motivate executives in the
pursuit of  excellent  performance.  Likewise,  we will oppose  plans that offer
unreasonable  benefits  to  executives  that  are  not  available  to any  other
shareholders.

PVS will  consider  whether the  proposed  plan is being  offered at fair market
value or at a discount;  whether the plan  excessively  dilutes the earnings per
share of the  outstanding  shares;  and  whether the plan gives  management  the
ability to replace or reprice "underwater" options. Repricing is an amendment to
a previously  granted  stock option  contract  that reduces the option  exercise
price.  Options are  "underwater"  when their current price is below the current
option contract price.  Options can also be repriced through  cancellations  and
re-grants.  The  typical  new grant  would have a  ten-year  term,  new  vesting
restrictions,  and a lower  exercise  price  reflecting the current lower market
price.  PVS will also consider any other features of the plan that may not be in
shareholders' best interest.

In  general,  we  consider  executive  and  director  compensation  plans  on  a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. When evaluating executive and director compensation matters,
we review the following three elements:

o DILUTION:  Vote AGAINST  plans in which the  potential  voting power  dilution
(VPD) of all shares outstanding exceeds 12 percent.
o FULL MARKET VALUE:  Awards must be granted at 100 percent of fair market value
on the date of grant.  However,  in instances when a plan is open to broad-based
employee  participation and excludes the five most highly compensated employees,
we accept a 15 percent discount.
o REPRICING:  Vote AGAINST plans if the company's  policy  permits  repricing of
"underwater" options or if the company has a history of repricing past options.

However,  in instances when repricing is put up for a shareholder  vote, we will
vote FOR the repricing of shares under the following four conditions:

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 23


<PAGE>

o The repricing is value for value;
o If the five most highly compensated employees are excluded from the repricing;
o If  the  plan  is  broad  based;  and
o If the current vesting schedule is maintained.

STOCK OPTION EXPENSING

The theory that stock  options  are  beneficial  to  shareholders  because  they
motivate  management  and  align  the  interests  of  investors  with  those  of
executives  is no  longer  held  sacrosanct.  The fact  that  companies  reprice
underwater  options  exposes  the  initial  fallacy  of this  theory.  A  recent
long-term  study of stock option  awards from the Indiana  University  School of
Business found that there was no correlation  whatsoever between executive stock
ownership and company performance. Given their accounting treatment of not being
charged as an expense against earnings, stock options have been the ultimate tax
dodge for companies wishing to lavishly compensate employees.

Misused  stock  options  can give  executives  an  incentive  to  inflate  their
company's earnings or make irresponsibly  optimistic  forecasts in order to keep
stock prices high and their paychecks gargantuan.  Alan Greenspan cautioned that
the  failure to  expense  stock  option  grants has  "introduced  a  significant
distortion  in  reported  earnings,  one that  has  grown  with  the  increasing
prevalence  of  this  form of  compensation."  Some  companies  have  chosen  to
acknowledge  the  distortion  caused by the  non-expensing  of options  and have
committed to expense options going forward.  And beginning in 2003, the SEC will
no longer exclude stock option  expensing  proposals from the proxy ballot using
the ordinary business exception rules.

o Support shareholder  resolutions calling for stock option grants to be treated
as an expense for accounting  and earnings  calculation  purposes.

OBRA-RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSALS

o Vote FOR amendments that place a cap on annual grants or amend  administrative
features.
o Vote FOR  plans  that  simply  amend  shareholder-approved  plans  to  include
administrative  features  or  place  a cap on the  annual  grants  that  any one
participant may receive in order to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m)
of OBRA.

AMENDMENTS TO ADD PERFORMANCE-BASED GOALS

Section 162(m) of the IRS Code Section limits the  deductibility of compensation
in excess of $1 million to a named executive  officer unless certain  prescribed
actions  are taken  including  shareholder  approval  and the  establishment  of
performance goals.

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 24


<PAGE>

o Vote FOR amendments to add performance goals to existing compensation plans to
comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) of OBRA.

AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE SHARES AND RETAIN TAX DEDUCTIONS UNDER OBRA

Amendments to existing plans to increase shares reserved and to qualify the plan
for  favorable tax treatment  under the  provisions of Section  162(m) should be
evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

APPROVAL OF CASH OR CASH-AND-STOCK  BONUS PLANS

o  Generally  vote  AGAINST  cash or  cash-and-stock  bonus  plans to exempt the
compensation  from taxes under the  provisions of Section  162(m) of OBRA if the
plan  provides for awards to individual  participants  in excess of $2 million a
year.
o Vote  AGAINST  plans that are deemed to be  "excessive"  because  they are not
justified by performance  measures.

PERFORMANCE BASED OPTIONS

Stock options are intended to align the  interests of  management  with those of
shareholders.  However, stock option grants without  performance-based  elements
can  excessively  compensate  executives  for stock  increases  due  solely to a
general  stock  market  rise,  rather than  improved or superior  company  stock
performance.  When option grants reach the hundreds of  thousands,  a relatively
small  increase in the share  price may permit  executives  to reap  millions of
dollars without providing material benefits to shareholders.

PVS advocates  performance  based options,  such as  premium-priced  or indexed,
which encourage executives to outperform rivals and the market as a whole rather
than being  rewarded for any rise in the share  price,  which can occur if there
are not empirical  performance  measures  incorporated into the structure of the
options.  Additionally, it should be noted that performance-accelerated  vesting
and   premium   priced   options   allow   fixed   plan   accounting,    whereas
performance-vested and indexed options entail certain expensing requirements.

o Generally vote FOR shareholder  proposals that seek to provide for performance
based options such as indexed and/or premium priced options.

SHAREHOLDER  PROPOSALS TO LIMIT  EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY

o Generally vote FOR shareholder  proposals that seek  additional  disclosure of
executive and director pay information.  Current SEC requirements  only call for
the disclosure of

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 25


<PAGE>

the top 5 most  highly  compensated  executives  and only if they earn more than
$100,000 in salary and benefits.
o  Generally  vote FOR  shareholder  proposals  that seek to  eliminate  outside
directors' retirement benefits.
o Review on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis all other  shareholder  proposals that seek to
limit executive and director pay. This includes shareholder  proposals that seek
to  link  executive   compensation   to  customer,   employee,   or  stakeholder
satisfaction.

GOLDEN AND TIN PARACHUTES

Golden  parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the
event of a  change-in-control.  Under most golden parachute  agreements,  senior
level  management   employees   receive  a  lump  sum  pay-out  triggered  by  a
change-in-control  at  usually  two to three  times base  salary.  Increasingly,
companies that have golden parachute  agreements for senior level executives are
extending  coverage  for all  their  employees  via  "tin"  parachutes.  The SEC
requires disclosure of all golden parachute arrangements in the proxy statement,
while  disclosure of tin  parachutes in company  filings is not required at this
time.

o Vote FOR shareholder proposals to all have golden and tin Parachute agreements
submitted for shareholder ratification.
o Generally vote AGAINST all proposals to ratify golden parachutes.
o Vote on tin parachutes on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)

An Employee Stock  Ownership Plan (ESOP) is an employee  benefit plan that makes
the  employees of a company also owners of stock in that  company.  Recently,  a
large  Rutgers  University  study of the  performance  of ESOPs in closely  held
companies  found that ESOPs appear to increase  overall sales,  employment,  and
sales per employee over what would have been expected  absent an ESOP. The study
also  found that ESOP  companies  are also more  likely to still be in  business
several  years  later,  and are more  likely to have  other  retirement-oriented
benefit plans than comparable non-ESOP companies.

o Vote FOR proposals that request shareholder  approval in order to implement an
ESOP or to increase  authorized  shares for existing  ESOPs except in cases when
the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is deemed "excessive" (i.e. generally
greater than five percent of outstanding shares).

                             STATE OF INCORPORATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VOTING ON STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE  basis  proposals to opt in or out of state takeover
statutes (including control share acquisition  statutes,  control share cash-out
statutes, freezeout provisions, fair price provisions,  stakeholder laws, poison
pill endorsements,  severance pay and labor contract provisions,  anti-greenmail
provisions,  and  disgorgement  provisions).  We generally  support  opting into
stakeholder  protection statutes if they provide  comprehensive  protections for
employees and community  stakeholders.  We would be less  supportive of takeover
statutes that only serve to protect incumbent  management from accountability to
shareholders and which negatively influence shareholder value.

OFFSHORE REINCORPORATIONS & TAX HAVENS

For a company that seeks to reincorporate, we evaluate the merits of the move on
a  CASE-BY-CASE   basis,  taking  into  consideration  the  company's  strategic
rationale for the move,  the  potential  economic  ramifications,  potential tax
benefits, and any corporate governance changes that may impact shareholders.  We
believe  there are a number of  concerns  associated  with a company  looking to
reincorporate  from the United  States to exotic  locales  such as Bermuda,  the
Cayman Islands or Panama.  The trend of U.S.  companies seeking to move offshore
appears to be on the rise, and shareholders are just beginning to understand the
web of  complexities  surrounding  the legal,  tax, and governance  implications
involved in such a transaction.

When reviewing a proposed offshore move, we will consider the following factors:

o Legal recourse for U.S. stockholders of the new company and the enforcement of
legal judgments against the company under the U.S. securities laws;
o The transparency (or lack thereof) of the new locale's legal system;
o Adoption of any shareholder-unfriendly corporate law provisions;
o Actual, qualified tax benefits;
o Potential for accounting manipulations and/or discrepancies;
o Any pending U.S. legislation concerning offshore companies; and
o  Prospects  of  reputational  harm and  potential  damage  to  brand  name via
increased media coverage concerning corporate expatriation.

Furthermore,  PVS  will  generally  support  shareholder  requests  calling  for
"expatriate"  companies that are domiciled  abroad yet  predominantly  owned and
operated in America to re-domesticate  back to a U.S. state  jurisdiction.

                    CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY & ACCOUNTABILITY
                 SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In    general,    we    support    social,    workforce,    and    environmental
shareholder-sponsored  resolutions if they seek to create responsible  corporate
citizens  while at the same time  attempting  to enhance  long-term  shareholder
value.

In most cases,  we will support  proposals that ask for disclosure  reporting of
additional information that is not available outside the company and that is not
proprietary in nature. Such reporting is particularly most vital when it appears
that a company  has not  adequately  addressed  shareholder  concerns  regarding
social, workplace, environmental and/or other issues.

In determining our vote on social, workplace,  environmental,  and other related
proposals,  we specifically analyze the following factors:

o Whether  adoption  of the  proposal  would have  either a positive or negative
impact on the company's short-term or long-term share value;
o Percentage of sales, assets, and earnings affected;
o Degree to which the company's  stated  position on the issues could affect its
reputation or sales, or leave it vulnerable to boycott or selective
purchasing;
o Whether  the issues  presented  should be dealt  with  through  government  or
company-specific action;
o Whether the company has already  responded in some  appropriate  manner to the
request embodied in a proposal;
o Whether the company's  analysis and voting  recommendation  to shareholders is
persuasive;
o What its industry peers have done in response to the issue;
o Whether the proposal itself is well framed and reasonable;
o Whether  implementation of the proposal would achieve the objectives sought in
the proposal; and
o Whether the subject of the proposal is best left to the
discretion  of the board.

In general, we support proposals that request the company to furnish information
helpful to shareholders in evaluating the company's  operations.  In order to be
able  to  intelligently  monitor  their  investments,  shareholders  often  need
information  best provided by the company in which they have invested.  Requests
to report such information merits support.

We will  evaluate  proposals  requesting  the  company to cease  taking  certain
actions  that the  proponent  believes is harmful to society or some  segment of
society with special  attention to the company's legal and ethical  obligations,
its  ability to remain  profitable,  and  potential  negative  publicity  if the
company fails to honor the request.

SPECIAL POLICY REVIEW AND  SHAREHOLDER  ADVISORY  COMMITTEES

These resolutions  propose the establishment of special  committees of the board
to address broad  corporate  policy and provide  forums for ongoing  dialogue on
issues including,  but not limited to: shareholder  relations,  the environment,
occupational health and safety, and executive compensation.

o Support  these  proposals  when they appear to offer a  potentially  effective
method for enhancing shareholder value.

MILITARY SALES

Shareholder  proposals from church groups ask companies for detailed  reports on
foreign military sales.  These proposals often can be created at reasonable cost
to the company and contain no proprietary  data. Large companies can supply this
information  without  undue  burden and provide  shareholders  with  information
affecting corporate performance and decision making.

o Generally support reports on foreign military sales and economic conversion of
facilities.
o Generally vote AGAINST proposals asking a company to develop specific military
contracting criteria.

POLITICAL  CONTRIBUTIONS  REPORTING

We believe employees should not be put in position where  professional  standing
and  goodwill  within  the  corporation  could be  jeopardized  as a  result  of
political beliefs.  Responsible employment practices should protect workers from
an  environment  characterized  by  political  indoctrination  or  intimidation.
Corporations should not devote resources to partisan political  activities,  nor
should  they compel  their  employees  to  contribute  to or support  particular
causes.  Moreover,  we  believe  it is wise  for a  corporation  to  maintain  a
politically  neutral stance as to avoid  potentially  embarrassing  conflicts of
interests that could negatively  impact the company's brand name with consumers.
Shareholders have the right to know about corporate  political  activities,  and
management's  knowledge  that such  information  can be made publicly  available
should   encourage  a  company's   lawful  and   responsible  use  of  political
contributions.

o Support proposals affirming political non-partisanship.
o Support   reporting  of  political  and  political   action  committee  (PAC)
contributions.
o Support  establishment  of corporate  political  contributions  guidelines and
reporting provisions.

EQUAL  EMPLOYMENT  OPPORTUNITY  AND OTHER WORK PLACE PRACTICE  REPORTING  ISSUES

These proposals generally request that a company establish a policy of reporting
to  shareholders  its progress with equal  opportunity  and  affirmative  action
programs.  The costs of violating  federal laws that prohibit  discrimination by
corporations are high and can affect corporate earnings.

The Equal  Opportunities  Employment  Commission  (EEOC)  does not  release  the
company's  filings to the public unless it is involved in litigation,  and it is
difficult to obtain from other  sources.  Companies need to be very sensitive to
minority  employment issues as the new evolving work force becomes  increasingly
diverse.  This  information  can be provided with little cost to the company and
does not  create an  unreasonable  burden on  management.

o Vote FOR  proposals  calling for action on equal  employment  opportunity  and
anti-discrimination.
o Vote FOR legal and  regulatory  compliance  and  public  reporting  related to
non-discrimination,   affirmative   action,   workplace   health   and   safety,
environmental  issues,  and labor policies and practices  that affect  long-term
corporate performance.
o Vote FOR non-discrimination in salary, wages, and all benefits.

HIGH-PERFORMANCE WORKPLACE

High-performance workplace practices emphasize employee training, participation,
and feedback.  The concept of a high-performance  workplace has been endorsed by
the U.S.  Department  of Labor and refers to a  workplace  that is  designed  to
provide workers with the information,  skills, incentives, and responsibility to
make decisions essential for innovation,  quality improvement and rapid response
to changes in the  marketplace.  These standards  embrace a "what's good for the
worker is good for the company" philosophy.  Studies have shown that improvement
in human  resources  practices is associated  with  increases in total return to
shareholders. High-performance workplace standards proposals can include linking
compensation  to social measures such as employee  training,  morale and safety,
environmental performance and workplace lawsuits.

o  Generally  support  proposals  that  incorporate  high-performance  workplace
standards.

NON-DISCRIMINATION IN RETIREMENT BENEFITS

A cash balance plan is a defined  benefit plan that treats an earned  retirement
benefit  as if it were a credit  from a  defined  contribution  plan,  but which
provides a stated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions
to these  plans are  credited  evenly over the life of a plan and not based on a
seniority  formula,  they may reduce  pay-outs  to long term  employees  who are
currently vested in plans.

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 30

<PAGE>

Cash-balance pension conversions are undergoing congressional and federal agency
scrutiny in the wake of high-profile EEOC complaints on age  discrimination  and
employee  anger at  companies  like  IBM.  While  significant  policy  reform is
unlikely in the  short-term,  business  interests  are  worried  enough that the
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS and other pro-business lobbies are forming
a coalition on Capitol Hill to preserve the essential  features of the plans and
to overturn a recent IRS ruling.

Driving  the  push  behind   conversions  from  traditional   pension  plans  to
cash-balance  plans are the substantial  savings that companies  generate in the
process.  Critics  point out that this  savings is gained at the  expense of the
most senior  employees.  Resolutions  call on  corporate  boards to  establish a
committee  of  outside  directors  to  prepare a report to  shareholders  on the
potential impact of  pension-related  proposals now being considered by national
policymakers  in reaction  to the  controversy  spawned by the plans.

o Support non-discrimination in retirement benefits.

FAIR LENDING

These  resolutions  call for financial  institutions to comply with fair lending
laws and statutes while avoiding predatory  practices in their subprime lending.
These predatory practices include:  lending to borrowers with inadequate income,
who will then  default;  not reporting on payment  performances  of borrowers to
credit agencies;  implying that credit life insurance is necessary to obtain the
loan (packing);  unnecessarily high fees;  refinancing with high additional fees
rather  than  working  out a  loan  that  is in  arrears  (flipping);  and  high
pre-payment fees.

o Support compliance with fair-lending laws.
o Support reporting on overall lending policies and data.

CERES  PRINCIPLES

These resolutions call for the adoption of principles that encourage the company
to protect the environment and the safety and health of its employees.

The CERES Principles, formulated by the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible
Economies,  require signing companies to address environmental issues, including
protection of the biosphere, sustainable use of natural resources, reduction and
disposal  of wastes,  energy  conservation,  and  employee  and  community  risk
reduction.  A signee to the CERES  Principles would disclose its efforts in such
areas through a standardized report submitted to CERES and made available to the
public.

Evidence suggests that environmentally conscious companies may realize long-term
savings by  implementing  programs to pollute  less and conserve  resources.  In
addition,

                                                     U.S.  Policy and Guidelines

<PAGE>

environmentally   responsible  companies  stand  to  benefit  from  good  public
relations  and new  marketing  opportunities.  Moreover,  the  reports  that are
required  of  signing  companies  provide  shareholders  with  more  information
concerning  topics they may deem  relevant  to their  company's  financial  well
being.

Many companies have voluntarily adopted these principles. PVS supports proposals
that improve a company's  public  image,  reduce  exposure to  liabilities,  and
establish standards so that  environmentally  responsible  companies and markets
are not at a competitive financial disadvantage.

o Vote FOR the adoption of the CERES Principles.
o Vote FOR adoption of reports to shareholders on environmental issues.

MACBRIDE  PRINCIPLES

These  resolutions  call  for  the  adoption  of  the  MacBride  Principles  for
operations located in Northern Ireland.  They request companies operating abroad
to support the equal  employment  opportunity  policies that apply in facilities
they  operate  domestically.  The  principles  were  established  to address the
sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland.
It is well  documented  that Northern  Ireland's  Catholic  community faces much
higher unemployment figures than the Protestant  community.  In response to this
problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment Act of 1989 (and
subsequent amendments) to address the sectarian hiring problems.

Many companies  believe that the Act adequately  addresses the problems and that
further action,  including adoption of the MacBride Principles,  only duplicates
the efforts  already  underway.  In  evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride
Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies
to  divest,  and  therefore  worsen the  unemployment  problem,  or whether  the
principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that the Fair
Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems. They
argue that the MacBride  Principles  will  stabilize  the  situation and promote
further investment.

o Support the  MacBride  Principles  for  operations  in Northern  Ireland  that
request companies to abide by equal employment opportunity policies.

CONTRACT  SUPPLIER  STANDARDS

These resolutions call for compliance with  governmental  mandates and corporate
policies regarding nondiscrimination,  affirmative action, work place safety and
health, and other basic labor protections.

PVS will generally support proposals that:

                                                      U.S. Policy and Guidelines
                                                                         Page 32

<PAGE>

o Seek  publication  of a "Worker  Code of  Conduct"  to the  company's  foreign
suppliers and licensees,  requiring they satisfy all applicable  labor standards
and laws protecting employees' wages, benefits,  working conditions,  freedom of
association, right to collectively bargain, and other rights.
o Request a report  summarizing the company's  current practices for enforcement
of its Worker Code of Conduct.
o Establishes  independent  monitoring  programs in  conjunction  with local and
respected  religious  and human rights  groups to monitor  supplier and licensee
compliance with the Worker Code of Conduct.
o Create  incentives  to  encourage  suppliers  to raise  standards  rather than
terminate contracts.
o Implement policies for ongoing wage adjustments,  ensuring adequate purchasing
power and a  sustainable  living wage for  employees  of foreign  suppliers  and
licensees.
o Request public disclosure of contract supplier reviews on a regular basis.
o Adopt labor  standards  for foreign and domestic  suppliers to ensure that the
company will not do business with foreign  suppliers that  manufacture  products
for sale in the U.S.  using forced or child  labor,  or that fail to comply with
applicable laws protecting employees' wages and working conditions.

CORPORATE CONDUCT,  HUMAN RIGHTS,  AND LABOR  CODES

PVS generally  supports  proposals that call for the adoption and/or enforcement
of clear principles or codes of conduct relating to countries in which there are
systematic  violations  of human  rights.  These  conditions  include the use of
slave, child, or prison labor, undemocratically elected governments,  widespread
reports by human rights advocates,  fervent pro-democracy  protests, or economic
sanctions  and boycotts.

Many proposals refer to the seven core conventions,  commonly referred to as the
"Declaration  on  Fundamental  Principles  and Rights At Work,"  ratified by the
International  Labor  Organization  (ILO). The seven conventions fall under four
broad  categories:   i)  right  to  organize  and  bargain   collectively;   ii)
non-discrimination in employment; iii) abolition of forced labor; and iv) end of
child labor. Each of the 180 member nations of the ILO body are bound to respect
and promote these rights to the best of their abilities.

o Support the  principles  and codes of conduct  relating to company  investment
and/or  operations  in  countries  with  patterns  of  human  rights  abuses  or
pertaining  to  geographic  regions  experiencing  political  turmoil  (Northern
Ireland, Columbia, Burma, former Soviet Union, and China).

o Support the implementation and reporting on ILO codes of conduct.
o  Support  independent  monitoring  programs  in  conjunction  with  local  and
respected  religious  and human rights  groups to monitor  supplier and licensee
compliance with Codes.

INTERNATIONAL  FINANCIAL RELATED

The  rise of  globalization  has put  increasing  importance  on the need for US
companies to periodically  monitor their business  operations abroad. As a means
to preserve brand integrity and protect against  potentially  costly  litigation
and negative public  relations,  PVS generally  supports  shareholder  proposals
which call for a report on the company's  core business  policies and procedures
of its  operations  outside the United  States.  Many of the  resolutions  which
address a company's international policies can include: impact of Foreign Direct
Investment  (FDI) in emerging market  economies;  corporate  safeguards  against
money  laundering;   economic  de-stabilization  concerns;   relationships  with
international  financial institutions (IFIs); and product sales/marketing abroad
(i.e., tobacco, pharmaceutical drug pricing).

o Generally support  proposals asking for policy  clarification and reporting on
foreign-related  matters  that can  materially  impact the  company's  short and
long-term bottom-line.

                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS, L.P.
                                FIRST TRUST FUNDS
                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors, L.P. (the "ADVISER") serves as investment adviser
providing discretionary investment advisory services for several open or
closed-end investment companies (the "FUNDS"). As part of these services, the
Adviser has full responsibility for proxy voting and related duties. In
fulfilling these duties, the Adviser and Funds have adopted the following
policies and procedures:

          1.  It is the  Adviser's  policy to seek to ensure  that  proxies  for
              securities held by a Fund are voted consistently and solely in the
              best economic interests of the respective Fund.

          2.  The Adviser  shall be  responsible  for the  oversight of a Fund's
              proxy voting process and shall assign a senior member of its staff
              to be responsible for this oversight.

          3.  The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional  Shareholder
              Services,  Inc. ("ISS") to make  recommendations to the Adviser on
              the voting of proxies  related to securities  held by a Fund.  ISS
              provides voting  recommendations  based on established  guidelines
              and  practices.  The Adviser has  adopted  these ISS Proxy  Voting
              Guidelines.

          4.  The Adviser  shall review the ISS  recommendations  and  generally
              will vote the  proxies in  accordance  with such  recommendations.
              Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Adviser  may  not  vote  in
              accordance with the ISS  recommendations  if the Adviser  believes
              that the specific ISS  recommendation is not in the best interests
              of the respective Fund.

          5.  If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and
              any of the Adviser's  clients hold any securities in that company,
              the  Adviser  will  vote  proxies   relating  to  such   company's
              securities in accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid any
              conflict  of  interest.  In  addition,  if the  Adviser has actual
              knowledge  of any other  type of  material  conflict  of  interest
              between itself and the respective  Fund with respect to the voting
              of a  proxy,  the  Adviser  shall  vote  the  applicable  proxy in
              accordance with the ISS  recommendations to avoid such conflict of
              interest.

          6.  If  a  Fund  requests  the  Adviser  to  follow   specific  voting
              guidelines or additional guidelines,  the Adviser shall review the
              request and follow such guidelines,  unless the Adviser determines
              that it is unable to follow  such  guidelines.  In such case,  the
              Adviser  shall  inform  the Fund that it is not able to follow the
              Fund's request.

          7.  The Adviser  may have  clients in addition to the Funds which have
              provided the Adviser with discretionary  authority to vote proxies
              on their behalf.  In such cases, the Adviser shall follow the same
              policies and procedures.

COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     On April 18, 2004  Registrant's  Board of Trustees adopted a Nominating and
Governance  Committee  Charter.  In the event a vacancy on the Board occurs, the
Nominating and Governance Committee may seek recommendations for candidates from
those sources it deems appropriate in its discretion,  including shareholders of
the  Fund.  The  Committee  may  retain a search  firm to  identify  candidates.
Shareholders  of the Fund who wish to  recommend  a person for  nomination  as a
candidate for a position on the Fund's Board should mail such  recommendation to
the Fund,  attention W. Scott Jardine,  1001 Warrenville Road, Suite 300, Lisle,
Illinois 60532.  Recommendations  must include (a) evidence of Fund ownership of
the person or entity  recommending the candidate (if a Fund shareholder);  (b) a
full  description  of  the  proposed  candidate's  background,  including  their
education,  experience,  current  employment  and date of  birth;  (c) names and
addresses  of at least three  professional  references  for the  candidate;  (d)
information as to whether the candidate is an "interested  person" (as such term
is defined in the 1940 Act) and such other information that may be considered to
impair the candidate's  independence;  and (e) any other information that may be
helpful to the Committee in evaluating the  candidate.  If a  recommendation  is
received with satisfactorily  completed information regarding a candidate during
a time when a vacancy  exists on the  Board or  during  such  other  time as the
Committee is accepting recommendations,  the recommendation will be forwarded to
the  Chairperson  of the  Committee  and  outside  counsel  to  the  Independent
Trustees.  Recommendations received at any other time will be kept on file until
such time as the Committee is accepting  recommendations at which point they may
be considered for nomination.

         240.15d-15(b)).

(b)      There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal
         half-year (the  registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an
         annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION.

         This code of  conduct  is being  adopted  by the  investment  companies
advised by First Trust Advisors,  L.P., set forth in Appendix A, as amended from
time to time,  (the  "FUNDS").  The  reputation  and  integrity of the Funds are
valuable assets that are vital to the Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds,
and officers and  employees of the  investment  adviser to the Funds who work on
Fund matters,  including each of the Funds' senior financial  officers ("SFOS"),
is responsible for conducting each Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates
a commitment to the highest  standards of integrity.  SFOs include the Principal
Executive  Officer (who is the President),  the Controller (who is the principal
accounting officer), and the Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer),
and any person who performs a similar function.

         The Funds,  First Trust Advisors,  L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted  Codes of Ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the  Investment  Company Act of
1940 (the "RULE  17J-1  CODE").  These  Codes of Ethics are  designed to prevent
certain  conflicts  of  interest  that may arise when  officers,  employees,  or
directors of the Funds and the  foregoing  entities know about present or future
Fund  transactions  and/or have the power to influence those  transactions,  and
engage in  transactions  with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise  take  advantage of their  position and  knowledge  with
respect to those  securities.  In an effort to prevent  these  conflicts  and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1,  the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions  and conduct that create  conflicts  of interest,  and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  was  designed  to  address  corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely  disclosing financial  information.  Under Section
406 of the Act, all public  companies  (including  the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent  future  situations  (such as  occurred in  well-reported  situations
involving  such  companies  as Enron and  WorldCom)  where a company  creates an
environment  in which  employees  are afraid to  express  their  opinions  or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds  have  chosen  to adopt a senior  financial  officer  Code of
Conduct to encourage  their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust  Advisors  or First Trust  Portfolios,  to act  ethically  and to question
potentially  unethical  or illegal  practices,  and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.

II. PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT.

         The purposes of this Code are:

         A.     To promote  honest and ethical  conduct,  including  the ethical
                handling of actual or  apparent  conflicts  of interest  between
                personal and professional relationships;

         B.     To promote full,  fair,  accurate,  timely,  and  understandable
                disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file with, or
                submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the Funds
                make;

         C.     To promote  compliance with applicable  governmental laws, rules
                and regulations;

         D.     To encourage  the prompt  internal  reporting to an  appropriate
                person of violations of the Code; and

         E.     To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE.

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated Mitchell E. Mohr or other
appropriate  officer  designated by the President of the respective  Funds to be
the Compliance  Coordinator for the  implementation  and  administration  of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         The Funds have adopted  guidelines  under which its SFOs perform  their
duties.  However, the Funds expect that ALL officers or employees of the adviser
or  distributor  who  participate  in the  preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

         A.     Act with  honesty and  integrity  and avoid  violations  of this
                Code,  including  actual or apparent  conflicts of interest with
                the Fund in personal and professional relationships.

         B.     Disclose  to the  Fund's  Compliance  Coordinator  any  material
                transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to
                give rise to any  violations  of the Code,  including  actual or
                apparent  conflicts  of  interest  with  the  Fund.  You  should
                disclose these  transactions  or  relationships  whether you are
                involved or have only observed the transaction or  relationship.
                If it is not possible to disclose  the matter to the  Compliance
                Coordinator,  it should be  disclosed  to the  Fund's  Principal
                Financial Officer or Principal Executive Officer.

         C.     Provide information to the Fund's other officers and appropriate
                employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,  outside
                auditor,  outside  counsel,

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                custodian,   etc.)  that  is  accurate,   complete,   objective,
                relevant, timely, and understandable.

         D.     Endeavor  to  ensure   full,   fair,   timely,   accurate,   and
                understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

         E.     Comply with the  federal  securities  laws and other  applicable
                laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

         F.     Act in good faith,  responsibly,  and with due care,  competence
                and  diligence,   without  misrepresenting   material  facts  or
                allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

         G.     Respect  the  confidentiality  of  information  acquired  in the
                course  of your  work  except  when you have  Fund  approval  to
                disclose it or where disclosure is otherwise  legally  mandated.
                You may not use confidential  information acquired in the course
                of your work for personal advantage.

         H.     Share and maintain  skills  important and relevant to the Fund's
                needs.

         I.     Proactively  promote  ethical  behavior among peers in your work
                environment.

         J.     Responsibly use and control all assets and resources employed or
                entrusted to you.

         K.     Record or  participate in the recording of entries in the Fund's
                books  and  records  that  are  accurate  to the  best  of  your
                knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE.

         SFOs and other  parties  subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain  provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting   their  request  in  writing  to  the  Compliance   Coordinator  for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's  shareholders  to the  extent  required  by SEC  rules.  A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code,  however,  shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual  basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.     REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS.

         A.     SFOs or other  officers of the Funds or  employees  of the First
                Trust group who work on Fund matters who observe,  learn of, or,
                in good faith,  suspect a violation of the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                Code MUST  immediately  report the  violation to the  Compliance
                Coordinator,  another  member  of the  Funds'  or First  Trust's
                senior management,  or to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board.
                An example of a possible Code violation is the  preparation  and
                filing of financial  disclosure  that omits material  facts,  or
                that is  accurate  but is  written  in a way that  obscures  its
                meaning.

         B.     Because  service  providers  such as an  administrator,  outside
                accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating
                to the  Funds'  financial  statements,  you  should be alert for
                actions by service providers that may be illegal,  or that could
                be viewed as dishonest or unethical  conduct.  You should report
                these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
                think,  that the service provider has its own code of ethics for
                its SFOs or employees.

         C.     SFOs or other  officers or employees  who report  violations  or
                suspected  violations  in good  faith  will  not be  subject  to
                retaliation   of  any   kind.   Reported   violations   will  be
                investigated   and  addressed   promptly  and  will  be  treated
                confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.    VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

         A.     Dishonest,  unethical  or  illegal  conduct  will  constitute  a
                violation  of  this  Code,   regardless  of  whether  this  Code
                specifically  refers to that particular  conduct. A violation of
                this Code may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
                termination of employment.  A variety of laws apply to the Funds
                and their operations,  including the Securities Act of 1933, the
                Investment  Company Act of 1940,  state laws  relating to duties
                owed by Fund  directors and  officers,  and criminal  laws.  The
                federal securities laws generally prohibit the Funds from making
                material  misstatements  in its prospectus  and other  documents
                filed with the SEC, or from  omitting to state a material  fact.
                These material  misstatements  and omissions  include  financial
                statements that are misleading or omit materials facts.

         B.     Examples of  criminal  violations  of the law include  stealing,
                embezzling,  misapplying  corporate  or  bank  funds,  making  a
                payment  for an  expressed  purpose  on a  Fund's  behalf  to an
                individual  who  intends to use it for a different  purpose;  or
                making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash or other
                items of value that are  intended to  influence  the judgment or
                actions  of  political   candidates,   government  officials  or
                businesses in connection with any of the Funds' activities.  The
                Funds must and will report all suspected criminal  violations to
                the appropriate  authorities for possible prosecution,  and will
                investigate,  address and report,  as appropriate,  non-criminal
                violations.
