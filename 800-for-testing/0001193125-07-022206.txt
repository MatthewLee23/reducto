Economic Update - Colonial High Income Municipal Trust





The US economy grew at a solid but uneven pace during the 12-month period that
began December 1, 2005 and ended November 30, 2006. Gross domestic product
(GDP) growth was robust in the first quarter of 2006, as businesses created
jobs at a brisk pace, industrial production rose and both personal spending and
personal income moved higher. However, a weak housing market began to weigh on
the economy, and the manufacturing sector contracted late in the
period--registering its first downturn since the spring of 2003. Against this
backdrop, economic growth averaged 3.0% for the 12-month period.

Between December and June, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) raised a key
short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, five times--to 5.25%. But as
economic growth slowed, the Fed turned cautious and declined to increase the
federal funds rate after its June meeting. Inflation also retreated during the
period, which lent further support to the Fed's decision. Investors reacted
favorably to the prospect of stable or possibly even lower interest rates and
both the stock and bond markets rallied in the second half of the period.

Solid returns from fixed income markets

Although yields moved higher early in the period, the US fixed income markets
delivered respectable returns, as prices rose and yields declined in reaction
to the Fed's mid-year decision to put further short-term rate increases on
hold. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a bellwether for the bond
market, ended the period at 4.4%--slightly lower than where it started.
High-yield bonds led the fixed income markets, reflecting investor confidence
about the overall resilience of the economy despite its slower pace of growth.

The views expressed in the Economic Update and the Portfolio Manager's report
reflect the current views of the respective parties. These views are not
guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that are difficult to predict so actual outcomes and results may
differ significantly from the views expressed. These views are subject to
change at any time based upon economic, market or other conditions and the
respective parties disclaim any responsibility to update such views. These
views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment
decisions for the trust are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as

  A portion of the trust's income may be subject to the alternative minimum
  tax. The trust may at times purchase tax-exempt securities at a discount from
  their original issue price. Some or all of this discount may be included in
  the trust's ordinary income, and any market discount is taxable when
  distributed.
For the 12-month period ended November 30, 2006, Colonial High Income Municipal
Trust generated a total return of 9.63%, based on its market price. Changes in
the market price of the trust's shares reflect investor demand and are not
necessarily linked directly to changes in the trust's net asset value. The
trust returned 10.58%, based on investment at net asset value, coming out
modestly behind the 10.80% average return of the Lipper High Yield Municipal
Debt Funds Classification./1/ The trust's performance also trailed the 10.90%
average return generated by a customized peer group, consisting of nine
leveraged closed-end high-yield municipal funds that have all issued preferred
shares. The trust benefited from its focus on longer-maturity bonds, but was
hampered by having a below-average stake in the top-performing airline sector
and a slightly lower sensitivity to interest rate changes than several peers as
interest rates declined.

Longer-maturity, high-yield municipals were leaders
High-yield municipal bonds posted strong gains during the past year, outpacing
investment-grade municipal issues. The high-yield sector benefited as
relatively low yields on investment-grade bonds prompted investors to search
for alternatives that offered higher yields. Solid economic growth also gave
investors confidence that issuers with lower credit ratings would be able to
meet their interest payments to bond holders. Longer-maturity bonds, which tend
to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than shorter-maturity issues, did
particularly well as inflation concerns eased in the second half of the period.
In this environment, the trust's focus on longer-maturity bonds worked well, as
did our decision to sell shorter-maturity issues.

Airline bonds aided returns
Airline bonds were strong contributors to performance, as the industry was
fueled by growing passenger loads and improved cash flows. Standouts included
bonds issued by American Airlines, Inc. and United Air Lines, Inc. (0.6% and
0.3% of total investments, respectively)./2/ Elsewhere, a multi-family housing
bond issued by Alexandria (Virginia) Courthouse Crossing, which was priced
below par, was unexpectedly called (or redeemed) at par ($100). In addition,
credit improvement gave a boost to bonds issued by Hoosier Care, Inc. (0.4% of
total investments), a nonprofit that runs pediatric and geriatric group homes
in Illinois and Indiana.

Nursing home bonds were detractors
Some of the trust's nursing home bonds experienced credit downgrades that
resulted in disappointing performance. They included bonds issued by a nursing
home in Gary, Indiana, which we sold at a loss, and bonds issued by Woodlawn
Manor, Inc. (0.2% of total investments), a Massachusetts nursing and
rehabilitation facility that is undergoing a management change.

/1/Lipper Inc., a widely respected data provider in the industry, calculates an
   average total return (assuming reinvestment of distributions) for mutual
   funds with investment objectives similar to those of the trust. Lipper makes
   no adjustment for the effect of sales loads.
/2/Holdings are discussed as of November 30, 2006, and are subject to change.

  Sector and quality breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of total
  investments. Ratings shown in the quality breakdown represent the rating
  assigned to a particular bond by one of the following rationally recognized
  rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies,
  Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. Ratings are
  relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Credit
  quality does not remove market risk. The majority of the bonds that are
  non-rated are considered by the advisor to be of non-investment grade quality.

  Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change periodically and
  may not be representative of current characteristics and holdings. Because
  the trust is actively managed, there is no guarantee that the trust will
  maintain these sectors or continue to have this quality breakdown in the
  future.

The trust's dividend yield declined as long-term interest rates fell
The trust's dividend yield fell as the income derived from leverage dropped.
The trust's leverage comes from its preferred shares, which were issued in
1999. We invest the proceeds from the preferred shares in longer maturity,
higher-yielding bonds, and then pay out to preferred shareholders a short-term
rate influenced by the federal funds rate--the overnight rate at which banks
lend each other money. During the past year, the dividend yield was squeezed on
both ends as the federal funds rate rose to 5.25% and long-term yields fell.
However, we believe leverage still gave common shareholders a higher dividend
payment than they would have earned without it. We added a number of senior
housing bonds, which offered added yield over higher quality issues, as well as
the potential for price appreciation.

Our outlook is cautiously optimistic
Going forward, we expect the high-yield municipal sector to benefit from strong
investor demand, relatively low long-term interest rates, stable inflation and
solid economic growth. However, we plan to add new bonds selectively, given
that there is little difference between the yields of lower and higher quality
issues. We plan to continue to focus on longer-maturity issues, which have the
potential to fare well, as long as inflation remains contained.

Portfolio Management
Maureen G. Newman has been the portfolio manager of Colonial High Income
Municipal Trust since August 1998. Ms. Newman has managed various municipal
funds for Columbia Management Advisors, LLC or its predecessors or affiliate
organizations since May 1996.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the trust's shares is determined by a number of factors, several
of which are beyond the control of the trust. Therefore, the trust cannot
predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the
credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic
developments and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest
rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.

Investing in high-yield or "junk" bonds offers the potential for higher income
than investments in investment-grade bonds, but also has a higher degree of
risk. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely
affect a high-yield bond issuer's ability to make timely principal and interest
payments.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves
special risks. The value of the trust will be affected by interest rate changes
and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and,
if applicable, the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains are not exempt from
income taxes.

Notes to Financial Statements - Colonial High Income Municipal Trust

November 30, 2006

Note 1. Organization
Colonial High Income Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts business
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

Investment Goal
The Trust seeks to provide high current income, generally exempt from federal
income taxes. The Trust's secondary goal is to seek total return.

Trust Shares
The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 4,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements.

Security Valuation
Debt securities generally are valued by pricing services approved by the
Trust's Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal,
institutional-size trading units of similar securities. The services may use
various pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations
are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid
quotation. Certain debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of
lesser quality, are priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial
condition of the issuer and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations
developed through pricing techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized
upon sale of the securities, and the potential variation may be greater for
those securities valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at net asset value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by
the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or that have
quotations which management believes are not reliable, are valued at fair value
as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures established
by and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees. If a security is
valued at "fair value", such value is likely to be different from the last
quoted market price for the security.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), was issued. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management has recently begun to evaluate the impact
the application of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statement
disclosures.

Security Transactions
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

Futures Contracts
The Trust may invest in futures contracts to hedge against the effects of
changes in the value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in
interest rates and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the
transactions are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in
the management of the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures
contracts involves certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation
between the price movement of the instruments and the underlying

32

<PAGE>


Colonial High Income Municipal Trust

November 30, 2006

securities, (2) inability to close out positions due to differing trading
hours, or the temporary absence of a liquid market, for either the instrument
or the underlying securities, or (3) an inaccurate prediction by Columbia
Management Advisors, LLC of the future direction of interest rates. Any of
these risks may involve amounts exceeding the variation margin recorded in the
Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin receivable or
payable and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust recognizes a
realized gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.

Swap Contracts
The Trust may engage in swap transactions such as interest rate and forward
swaps, consistent with its investment objective and policies to obtain a
desired return at a lower cost than if the Trust had invested directly in the
asset that yielded the desired return. Swaps involve the exchange by the Trust
with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest
or total return throughout the lives of the agreements. The interest to be paid
or received on swaps is included in net realized gain/(loss) on investments.
Unrealized gains are reported as an asset and unrealized losses are reported as
a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A realized gain or loss
is recorded upon termination of swap agreements and is equal to the difference
between the Trust's basis in the swap and the proceeds from (or cost of) the
closing transaction. Swap agreements are stated at fair value. Notional
principal amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in these
transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much
smaller.

If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap contract, the Trust will be
limited to contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties will
be able to meet their obligations pursuant to the swap contracts or that, in
the event of default, the Trust will succeed in pursuing contractual remedies.
The Trust thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from
obtaining payments owed to it pursuant to the swap contracts.

The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

Restricted Securities
Restricted securities are securities that may only be resold upon registration
under federal securities laws or in transactions exempt from registration. In
some cases, the issuer of restricted securities has agreed to register such
securities for resale at the issuer's expense either upon demand by the Trust
or in connection with another registered offering of the securities. Many
restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions
exempt from registration. Such restricted securities may be determined to be
liquid under criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The Trust will not
incur any registration costs upon such resale.

Delayed Delivery Securities
The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the
Trust to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies
cash or liquid portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in an
amount equal to the delayed delivery commitment.

Income Recognition
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Original issue discount is
accreted to interest income over the life of the security with a corresponding
increase in the cost basis. Premium and discount are amortized and accreted,
respectively, on all debt securities. Corporate actions and dividend income are
recorded on the ex-date.

Federal Income Tax Status
The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company"
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will
distribute substantially all of its tax exempt or taxable income, if any, for
its tax year, and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes. In
addition, the Trust intends to distribute in each calendar year substantially
all of its net investment income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if
any, such that the Trust should not be subject to federal excise tax.
Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is recorded.

                                                                             33

<PAGE>


Colonial High Income Municipal Trust

November 30, 2006


Distributions to Shareholders
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions
to Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of
each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally
seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on November 30, 2006, was
3.35% for Series T and 3.60% for Series W. For the year ended November 30,
2006, the Trust declared dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting
to $4,016,026 representing an average dividend rate of 3.35% per APS.

Indemnification
In the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that contain
a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general
indemnities. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown,
as this would involve future claims against the Trust. Also, under the Trust's
organizational documents and by contract, the Trustees and Officers of the
Trust are indemnified against certain liabilities that may arise out of their
duties to the Trust. However, based on experience, the Trust expects the risk
of loss due to these warranties and indemnities to be minimal.

Note 3. Federal Tax Information
The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from
GAAP. Reclassifications are made to the Trust's capital accounts for permanent
tax differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

For the year ended November 30, 2006, permanent book and tax basis differences
resulting primarily from differing treatments for discount accretion/premium
amortization on debt securities were identified and reclassified among the
components of the Trust's net assets as follows:

<TABLE>

                      Net Investment Net Realized Paid-In

                      $(38,235)      $38,235      $--
</TABLE>

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended November 30,
2006 and November 30, 2005 was as follows:

November 30, 2006


Under current tax rules, certain capital losses realized after October 31 may
be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following fiscal
year. As of November 30, 2006, post-October capital losses of $893,924
attributed to security transactions were deferred to December 1, 2006.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (the "Interpretation"). This
Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006
and is to be applied to open tax positions upon initial adoption.
This Interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement
method for the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return and also requires certain expanded
disclosures. Management has recently begun to evaluate the application of this
Interpretation to the Trust and has not at this time quantified the impact, if
any, resulting from the adoption of this Interpretation on the Trust's
financial statements.

Note 4. Fees and Compensation Paid to Affiliates

Investment Advisory Fee
Columbia Management Advisors, LLC ("Columbia"), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor to
the Trust and provides administrative and other services. Columbia receives a
monthly investment advisory fee at the annual rate of 0.75% of the Trust's
average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to the APS.

Pricing and Bookkeeping Fees
Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement
(the "Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated certain functions to
State Street Bank & Trust Company ("State Street"). As a result, the total fees
payable under the pricing and bookkeeping agreement (other than certain
reimbursements paid to Columbia and discussed below) are paid to State Street.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
an annual fee of $38,000 paid monthly plus an additional monthly fee based on
the level of average daily net assets for the month; provided that during any
12-month period, the aggregate fee (exclusive of out-of-pocket expenses and
charges) shall not exceed $140,000.

The Trust also reimburses Columbia and State Street for out-of-pocket expenses
and charges, including fees payable to third parties for pricing the Trust's
portfolio securities and direct internal costs incurred by Columbia in
connection with providing fund accounting oversight and monitoring and certain
other services. For the year ended November 30, 2006, the effective pricing and
bookkeeping fee rate for the Trust, inclusive of out-of-pocket expenses, was
0.029% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

Custody Credits
The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset
arrangement in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an
agreement.

Fees Paid to Officers and Trustees
All officers of the Trust, with the exception of the Trust's Chief Compliance
Officer, are employees of Columbia or its affiliates and receive no
compensation from the Trust. The Board of Trustees has appointed a Chief
Compliance Officer to the Trust in accordance with federal securities

share of the expenses associated with the Chief Compliance Officer. The Trust's
expenses for the Office of the Chief Compliance Officer will not exceed $15,000
per year.

The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan which may
be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of

Colonial High Income Municipal Trust

November 30, 2006


Note 5. Portfolio Information
For the year ended November 30, 2006, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $118,009,492 and
$101,244,972, respectively.

Note 6. Preferred Shares
The Trust currently has outstanding 4,800 APS (2,400 shares each of Series T
and W). The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per APS plus
accumulated but unpaid dividends and have certain class specific preferences
over the common shares. The dividend rate on the APS is set, typically every
seven days, through an auction process. Dividends on the APS are cumulative.
Each holder of the APS is entitled to one vote per APS. Unless otherwise
required by law or under the terms of the bylaws, each holder of APS has the
same voting rights as common shareholders and will vote together with common
shareholders as a single class. The holders of APS, voting as a separate class,
have the right to: (a) elect at least two Trustees, (b) elect a majority of the
Trustees at any time when dividends on the APS are due and unpaid for two full
years, and (c) vote on certain matters affecting the rights of the APS.

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least
200% with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which
any APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more
stringent asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS agreement and
in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies.
Should these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS
not be paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to
common shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At November 30,
2006, there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

Note 7. Disclosure of Significant Risks and Contingencies

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Trust holds investments that are insured by private insurers who guarantee
the payment of principal and interest in the event of default or that are
supported by a letter of credit. Each of the Trust's insurers is rated Aaa by
Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's") or rated AAA by Standard & Poor's
except for Radian Asset Assurance, Inc., which is rated Aa3 and AA by Moody's
and Standard & Poor's, respectively. At November 30, 2006, investments
supported by private insurers that represent greater than 5% of the total
investments of the Trust were as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                             % of Total

                       Ambac Assurance Corp.     6.7%
</TABLE>

Geographic Concentration

The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at November 30, 2006
invested in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Colorado,
Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, and their respective political
subdivisions, agencies and public authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to
economic and political factors adversely affecting issuers of the specific
state's municipal securities than are municipal bond funds that are not
concentrated to the same extent in these issuers.

High-Yield Securities
Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk" bonds. Economic
downturns may disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers
to repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in interest rates would
likely have an adverse impact on the value of such obligations. Moreover,
high-yield securities may be less liquid to the extent that there is no
established secondary market.

Industry Focus
The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

Legal Proceedings
On February 9, 2005, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (which has since merged
into Banc of America Capital Management, LLC (now named Columbia Management
Advisors, LLC)) ("Columbia") and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (which has
been renamed Columbia Management Distributors, Inc.) (the "Distributor")
(collectively, the "Columbia Group") entered into an Assurance of
Discontinuance with the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG
Settlement") and consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order by the
Securities and

Exchange Commission ("SEC") (the "SEC Order"). The SEC Order and the NYAG
Settlement are referred to collectively as the "Settlements". The Settlements
contain substantially the same terms and conditions as outlined in the
agreements in principle which Columbia Group entered into with the SEC and NYAG
in March 2004.

Under the terms of the SEC Order, the Columbia Group agreed, among other
things, to: pay $70 million in disgorgement and $70 million in civil money
penalties; cease and desist from violations of the antifraud provisions and
certain other provisions of the federal securities laws; maintain certain
compliance and ethics oversight structures; retain an independent consultant to
review the Columbia Group's applicable supervisory, compliance, control and
other policies and procedures; and retain an independent distribution
consultant (see below). The Columbia Funds have also voluntarily undertaken to
implement certain governance measures designed to maintain the independence of
their boards of trustees. The NYAG Settlement also, among other things,
requires Columbia and its affiliates to reduce management fees for certain
Columbia Funds (including the former Nations Funds) and other mutual funds
collectively by $32 million per year for five years, for a projected total of
$160 million in management fee reductions.

Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the SEC order, the $140 million in
settlement amounts described above will be distributed in accordance with a
distribution plan developed by an independent distribution consultant and
approved by the SEC. The independent distribution consultant has been in
consultation with the staff of the SEC and has submitted a proposed plan of
distribution. The SEC has released the proposed plan of distribution for public
notice and comment but has not yet approved a final plan of distribution.

As a result of these matters or any adverse publicity or other developments
resulting from them, the market price of trust shares could decline.

A copy of the SEC Order is available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov.
A copy of the NYAG Settlement is available as part of the Bank of America
Corporation Form 8-K filing on February 10, 2005.

In connection with the events described in detail above, various parties have
filed suit against certain funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds,
FleetBoston Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of
America and its affiliated entities.

On February 20, 2004, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
transferred these cases and cases against other mutual fund companies based on
similar allegations to the United States District Court in Maryland for
consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings (the "MDL"). Subsequently,
additional related cases were transferred to the MDL. On September 29, 2004,
the plaintiffs in the MDL filed amended and consolidated complaints. One of
these amended complaints is a putative class action that includes claims under
the federal securities laws and state common law, and that names Columbia, the
Distributor, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds, Bank of America Corporation
and others as defendants. Another of the amended complaints is a derivative
action purportedly on behalf of the Columbia Funds that asserts claims under
federal securities laws and state common law.

On February 25, 2005, Columbia and other defendants filed motions to dismiss
the claims in the pending cases. On March 1, 2006, for reasons stated in the
court's memoranda dated November 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions
to dismiss. The court dismissed all of the class action claims pending against
the Columbia Funds Trusts. As to Columbia and the Distributor, the claims under
the Securities Act of 1933, the claims under Sections 34(b) and 36(a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 ("ICA") and the state law claims were dismissed.
The claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and claims under Section 36(b) of the ICA were not dismissed.

On March 21, 2005, a purported class action was filed in Massachusetts state
court alleging that the conduct, including market timing, entitles Class B
shareholders in certain Columbia funds to an exemption from contingent deferred
sales charges upon early redemption ("the CDSC Lawsuit"). The CDSC Lawsuit has
been removed to federal court in Massachusetts and the federal Judicial Panel
has transferred the CDSC Lawsuit to the MDL.

On April 4, 2006, the plaintiffs and the Columbia defendants named in the MDL,
including the Columbia Funds, entered into a term sheet containing the
principal terms of a stipulation of settlement that would settle all Columbia-

                                                                             37

related claims in the MDL described above, including the
CDSC Lawsuit. On April 6, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland stayed all actions with respect to these Columbia-related claims.

In 2004, certain Columbia funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds, advisers
and affiliated entities were named as defendants in certain purported
shareholder class and derivative actions making claims, including claims under
the Investment Company and the Investment Advisers Acts of 1940 and state law.
The suits allege, inter alia, that the fees and expenses paid by the funds are
excessive and that the advisers and their affiliates inappropriately used fund
assets to distribute the funds and for other improper purposes. On March 2,
2005, the actions were consolidated in the Massachusetts federal court as In re
Columbia Entities Litigation. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended
complaint on June 9, 2005 naming the Columbia Funds as nominal defendants. On
November 30, 2005, the judge dismissed all claims by plaintiffs and ordered
that the case be closed. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on December 30, 2005; this appeal
is currently pending. The parties have advised the appellate court that they
are engaged in settlement discussions and the court has, accordingly, deferred
the briefing schedule for the appeal. The settlement has not yet been
finalized. Any settlement ultimately agreed by the parties will be subject to
court approval.

This matter is ongoing. Accordingly, no estimate can be made of the financial
impact, if any, of this litigation on any fund.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Trustees and the Shareholders of Colonial High Income Municipal Trust
In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the investment portfolio, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Colonial High Income Municipal
Trust (the "Trust") at November 30, 2006, and the results of its operations,
the changes in its net assets and its financial highlights for the periods
indicated, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at November 30, 2006 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan - Colonial High Income Municipal Trust


Shareholders may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
automatically reinvested by Computershare (the "Plan Agent"), as agent under
the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the Plan, the
provisions of which are described below, shareholders not making such an
election will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check mailed directly to
the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If the Trustees of the Trust declare a dividend or determine to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares of the Trust or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, nonparticipants in the Plan will receive cash
and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of the
Trust. If the market price of the shares on the payment date for the dividend
or distribution is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, participants will
be issued shares of the Trust at the higher of net asset value or 95% of the
market price. If the net asset value exceeds the market price of Trust shares
at such time, or if the Trust declares a dividend or other distribution payable
only in cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy Trust
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the Trust's shares, the average
per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value
of the Trust's shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Trust. In
circumstances in which the net asset value of Trust shares is more than 5%
below their market price, participants in the Plan will be issued shares
through the Plan at a price exceeding net asset value.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to the
participant's account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be
made for any fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's
notice of election to participate in or withdraw from the Plan must be received
by the Plan Agent before the record date for a dividend in order to be given
effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered
in such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who
are to participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting dividends or
distributions. The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of
dividends and distributions will be paid by the Trust. There will be no
brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Trust as a
result of dividends or distributions payable either in stock or in cash.
However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection
with the reinvestment of dividends or distributions.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days written notice to Plan
participants. Contact the Plan Agent for more information regarding the Plan.
All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to Computershare by
mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010, or by phone at
1-800-730-6001.

Board Consideration and Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements


The Advisory Fees and Expenses Committee of the Board of Trustees meets one or
more times annually to review the advisory agreements (collectively, the
"Agreements") of the funds for which the Trustees serve as trustees (each a
"fund") and determine whether to recommend that the full Board approve the
continuation of the Agreements for an additional one-year period. After the
Committee has made its recommendation, the full Board, including the
Independent Trustees, determines whether to approve the continuation of the
Agreements. In addition, the Board, including the Independent Trustees,
considers matters bearing on the Agreements at most of its other meetings
throughout the year and meets regularly with the heads of each investment area
within Columbia. Through the Board's Investment Oversight Committees, Trustees
also meet with selected fund portfolio managers at various times throughout the
year.

The Trustees receive and review all materials that they, their legal counsel or
Columbia, the funds' investment adviser, believe to be reasonably necessary for
the Trustees to evaluate the Agreements and determine whether to approve the
continuation of the Agreements. Those materials generally include, among other
items, (i) information on the investment performance of each fund relative to
the performance of peer groups of mutual funds and the fund's performance
benchmarks, (ii) information on each fund's advisory fees and other expenses,
including information comparing the fund's expenses to those of peer groups of
mutual funds and information about any applicable expense caps and fee
"breakpoints," (iii) information about the profitability of the Agreements to
Columbia, including potential "fall-out" or ancillary benefits that Columbia
and its affiliates may receive as a result of their relationships with the
funds and (iv) information obtained through Columbia's response to a
questionnaire prepared at the request of the Trustees by counsel to the funds
and independent legal counsel to the Independent Trustees. The Trustees also
consider other information such as (v) Columbia's financial results and
financial condition, (vi) each fund's investment objective and strategies and
the size, education and experience of Columbia's investment staffs and their
use of technology, external research and trading cost measurement tools,
(vii) the allocation of the funds' brokerage, if any, and the use of "soft"
commission dollars to pay for research products and services, (vii) Columbia's
resources devoted to, and its record of compliance with, the funds' investment
policies and restrictions, policies on personal securities transactions and
other compliance policies, (ix) Columbia's response to various legal and
regulatory proceedings since 2003 and (x) the economic outlook generally and
for the mutual fund industry in particular. In addition, the Advisory Fees and
Expenses Committee confers with the funds' independent fee consultant and
reviews materials relating to the funds' relationships with Columbia provided
by the independent fee consultant. Throughout the process, the Trustees have
the opportunity to ask questions of and request additional materials from
Columbia and to consult with independent legal counsel to the Independent
Trustees and the independent fee consultant.

The Board of Trustees most recently approved the continuation of the Agreements
at its October, 2006 meeting, following meetings of the Advisory Fees and
Expenses Committee held in August, September and October, 2006. In considering
whether to approve the continuation of the Agreements, the Trustees, including
the Independent Trustees, did not identify any single factor as determinative,
and each weighed various factors as he or she deemed appropriate. The Trustees
considered the following matters in connection with their approval of the
continuation of the Agreements:

The nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the funds under the
Agreements. The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the
services provided by Columbia and its affiliates to the funds and the resources
dedicated to the funds by Columbia and its affiliates. Among other things, the
Trustees considered (i) Columbia's ability (including its personnel and other
resources, compensation programs for personnel involved in fund management,
reputation and other attributes) to attract and retain highly qualified
research, advisory and supervisory investment professionals; (ii) the portfolio
management services provided by those investment professionals; and (iii) the
trade execution services provided on behalf of the funds. For each fund, the
Trustees also considered the benefits to shareholders of investing in a mutual
fund that is part of a family of funds offering exposure to a variety of asset
classes and investment disciplines and providing a variety of fund and
shareholder services. After reviewing those and related factors, the Trustees
concluded, within the context of their overall conclusions regarding each of
the Agreements, that the nature, extent and quality of services provided
supported the continuation of the Agreements.

<PAGE>





Investment performance of the funds and Columbia. The Trustees reviewed
information about the performance of each fund over various time periods,
including information prepared by an independent third party that compared the
performance of each fund to the performance of peer groups of mutual funds and
performance benchmarks. The Trustees also reviewed a description of the third
party's methodology for identifying each fund's peer group for purposes of
performance and expense comparisons. The Trustees also considered additional
information that the Advisory Fees and Expenses Committee requested from
Columbia relating to funds that presented relatively weaker performance and/or
relatively higher expenses.

In the case of each fund whose performance lagged that of a relevant peer group
for certain (although not necessarily all) periods, the Trustees concluded that
other factors relevant to performance were sufficient, in light of other
considerations, to warrant continuation of the fund's Agreements. Those factors
varied from fund to fund, but included one or more of the following: (i) that
the fund's performance, although lagging in certain recent periods, was
stronger over the longer term; (ii) that the underperformance was attributable,
to a significant extent, to investment decisions that were reasonable and
consistent with the fund's investment strategy and policies and that the fund
was performing as expected, given these investment decisions, market conditions
and the fund's investment strategy; (iii) that the fund's performance was
competitive when compared to other relevant performance benchmarks or peer
groups; (iv) that Columbia had taken or was taking steps designed to help
improve the fund's investment performance, including, but not limited to,
replacing portfolio managers or modifying investment strategies; and (v) that
the fund was proposed to be reorganized into another fund, and that such
reorganization would result in a reduction in fund expenses.

The Trustees also considered Columbia's performance and reputation generally,
the funds' performance as a fund family generally, and Columbia's historical
responsiveness to Trustee concerns about performance and Columbia's willingness
to take steps intended to improve performance.

After reviewing those and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the
context of their overall conclusions regarding each of the Agreements, that the
performance of each fund and Columbia was sufficient, in light of other
considerations, to warrant the continuation of the Agreement(s) pertaining to
that fund.

The costs of the services provided and profits realized by Columbia and its
affiliates from their relationships with the funds. The Trustees considered the
fees charged to the funds for advisory services as well as the total expense
levels of the funds. That information included comparisons (provided by
management and by an independent third party) of each fund's advisory fees and
total expense levels to those of the fund's peer groups and information about
the advisory fees charged by Columbia to comparable institutional accounts. In
considering the fees charged to those accounts, the Trustees took into account,
among other things, management's representations about the differences between
managing mutual funds as compared to other types of accounts, including
differences in the services provided, differences in the risk profile of such
business for Columbia, and the additional resources required to manage mutual
funds effectively. In evaluating each fund's advisory fees, the Trustees also
took into account the demands, complexity and quality of the investment
management of the fund. The Trustees considered existing advisory fee
breakpoints, and Columbia's use of advisory fee waivers and expense caps, which
benefited a number of the funds. The Trustees also noted management's stated
justification for the fees charged to the funds, which included information
about the investment performance of the funds and the services provided to the
funds.

The Trustees also considered the compensation directly or indirectly received
by Columbia and its affiliates from their relationships with the funds. The
Trustees reviewed information provided by management as to the profitability to
Columbia and its affiliates of their relationships with each fund, and
information about the allocation of expenses used to calculate profitability.
When reviewing profitability, the Trustees also considered court cases in which
adviser profitability was an issue in whole or in part, the performance of the
relevant funds, the expense level of each fund, and whether Columbia had
implemented breakpoints and/or expense caps with respect to the fund.

After reviewing those and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the
context of their overall conclusions regarding each of the Agreements, that the
advisory fees charged to each fund, and the related profitability to Columbia

                                                                             47

<PAGE>




and its affiliates of their relationships with the fund, supported the
continuation of the Agreement(s) pertaining to that fund.

Economies of Scale. The Trustees considered the existence of any economies of
scale in the provision by Columbia of services to each fund, to groups of
related funds, and to Columbia's investment advisory clients as a whole and
whether those economies were shared with the funds through breakpoints in the
investment advisory fees or other means, such as expense waivers/reductions and
additional investments by Columbia in investment, trading and compliance
resources. The Trustees noted that many of the funds benefited from
breakpoints, expense caps, or both. In considering those issues, the Trustees
also took note of the costs of the services provided (both on an absolute and a
relative basis) and the profitability to Columbia and its affiliates of their
relationships with the funds, as discussed above.

After reviewing those and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the
context of their overall conclusions regarding each of the Agreements, that the
extent to which economies of scale were shared with the funds supported the
continuation of the Agreements.

Other Factors. The Trustees also considered other factors, which included but
were not limited to the following:

.. the extent to which each fund had operated in accordance with its investment
  objective and investment restrictions, the nature and scope of the compliance
  programs of the funds and Columbia and the compliance-related resources that
  Columbia and its affiliates were providing to the funds;

.. the nature, quality, cost and extent of administrative and shareholder
  services performed by Columbia and its affiliates, both under the Agreements
  and under separate agreements for the provision of transfer agency and
  administrative services;

.. so-called "fall-out benefits" to Columbia and its affiliates, such as the
  engagement of its affiliates to provide distribution, brokerage and transfer
  agency services to the funds, and the benefits of research made available to
  Columbia by reason of brokerage commissions generated by the funds'
  securities transactions, as well as possible conflicts of interest associated
  with those fall-out and other benefits, and the reporting, disclosure and
  other processes in place to disclose and monitor those possible conflicts of
  interest; and

.. the draft report provided by the funds' independent fee consultant, which
  included information about and analysis of the funds' fees, expenses and
  performance.

Based on their evaluation of all factors that they deemed to be material,
including those factors described above, and assisted by the advice of
independent counsel and the independent fee consultant, the Trustees, including
the Independent Trustees, approved the continuance of each of the Agreements
through October 31, 2007.

Summary of Management Fee Evaluation by Independent Fee Consultant

INDEPENDENT FEE CONSULTANT'S EVALUATION OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH MANAGEMENT FEES
ARE NEGOTIATED FOR THE COLUMBIA MUTUAL FUNDS OVERSEEN BY THE COLUMBIA ATLANTIC
BOARD

Prepared Pursuant to the February 9, 2005 Assurance of Discontinuance between
the Office of Attorney General of New York State and Columbia Management
Advisors, Inc. and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. October 11, 2006

  I. Overview

Columbia Management Advisors, LLC ("CMA") and Columbia Funds Distributors,
Inc./1/ ("CFD") agreed on February 9, 2005 to the New York Attorney General's
Assurance of Discontinuance ("AOD"). Among other things, the AOD stipulates
that CMA may manage or advise a Columbia Fund ("Fund" and together with all
such funds or a group of such funds as the "Funds") only if the Independent
Members of the Fund's Board of Trustees (such Independent Members of the Fund's
Board together with the other members of the Fund's Board, referred to as the
"Trustees") appoint a Senior Officer or retain an Independent Fee Consultant
("IFC") who is to manage the process by which proposed management fees are
negotiated. The AOD further stipulates that the Senior Officer or IFC is to
prepare a written annual evaluation of the fee negotiation process.

On September 14, 2006, the Independent Members of the Funds' Boards retained me
as IFC for the Funds. In this capacity, I have prepared the second annual
written evaluation of the fee negotiation process. I am successor to the first
IFC, Erik Sirri, who prepared the annual evaluation in 2005 and who contributed
to the second annual written evaluation until his resignation as IFC in August
2006 to become Director of the Division of Market Regulation at the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission./2/

A. Role of the Independent Fee Consultant
The AOD charges the IFC with "managing the process by which proposed management
fees...to be charged the Columbia Fund are negotiated so that they are
negotiated in a manner which is at arms' length and reasonable and consistent
with this Assurance of Discontinuance." In this role, the IFC does not replace
the Trustees in negotiating management fees with CMA, and the IFC does not
substitute his or her judgment for that of the Trustees about the
reasonableness of proposed fees. As the AOD states, CMA "may manage or advise a
Columbia Fund only if the reasonableness of the proposed management fees is
determined by the Board of Trustees...using...an annual independent written
evaluation prepared by or under the direction of...the Independent Fee
Consultant."

B. Elements Involved in Managing the Fee Negotiation Process
Managing the fee negotiation process has three elements. One involves reviewing
the information provided by CMG to the Trustees for evaluating the proposed
management fees and augmenting that information, as necessary, with additional
information from CMG or other sources and with further analyses of the
information and data. The second element involves reviewing the information and
analysis relative to at least the following six factors set forth in the AOD:

1.The nature and quality of CMA's services, including the Fund's performance;

2.Management fees (including any components thereof) charged by other mutual
  fund companies for like services;

3.Possible economies of scale as the Fund grows larger;

/1/CMA and CFD are subsidiaries of Columbia Management Group, Inc. ("CMG"),
   which also is the parent of Columbia Management Services, Inc. ("CFS"), the
   Funds' transfer agent. Before the date of this report, CMA merged into an
   affiliated entity, Banc of America Capital Management, LLC, which was
   renamed Columbia Management Advisors, LLC and which carries on the business
   of CMA. CFD also has been renamed Columbia Management Distributors, Inc.
/2/I am an independent economic consultant. From August 2005 until August 2006,
   I provided support to Mr. Sirri as an independent consultant. From 1994 to
   2004, I was Chief Economist at the Investment Company Institute. Earlier, I
   was Section Chief and Assistant Director at the Federal Reserve Board and
   Professor of Economics at Oklahoma State University. I have no material
   relationship with Bank of America or CMG, aside from serving as IFC, and I
   am aware of no material relationship with any of their affiliates. To assist
   me with the report, I engaged NERA Economic Consulting, an independent
   consulting firm that has had extensive experience in the mutual fund
   industry. I also have

                                                                             49

<PAGE>





4.Management fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional
  and other clients of CMA for like services;

5.Costs to CMA and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the
  management fee agreements, excluding any intra-corporate profit; and

6.Profit margins of CMA and its affiliates from supplying such services.
  retained Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP as counsel to advise me in connection
  with the report.

The final element involves providing the Trustees with a written evaluation of
the above factors as they relate to the fee negotiation process.

C. Organization of the Annual Evaluation
The 2006 annual evaluation focuses on the six factors and contains a section
for each factor except that CMA's costs and profits from managing the Funds
have been combined into a single section. In each section, the discussion of
the factor considers and analyzes the available data and other information as
they bear upon the fee negotiation process. If appropriate, the discussion in
the section may point out certain aspects of the proposed fees that may warrant
particular attention from the Trustees. The discussion also may suggest other
data, information, and approaches that the Trustees might consider
incorporating into the fee negotiation process in future years.

In addition to a discussion of the six factors, the report reviews the status
of recommendations made in the 2005 IFC evaluation. The 2006 report also
summarizes the findings with regard to the six factors and contains a summary
of recommendations for possible enhancements to the process.

  II. Status of 2005 Recommendations

The 2005 IFC evaluation contains recommendations aimed at enhancing the
evaluation of proposed management fees by Trustees. The section summarizes
those recommendations and includes my assessment of the response to the
recommendations.

1.Recommendation: Trustees should consider requesting more analytical work from
  CMG in the preparation of future 15(c) materials.

 Status: CMG has provided additional analyses to the Trustees on economies of
 scale, a comparative analysis of institutional and retail management fees,
 management fee breakpoints, risk-adjusted performance, fee waivers and expense
 reimbursements, and CMG's costs and profitability.

2.Recommendation: Trustees may wish to consider whether CMG should continue
  expanding the use of Morningstar or other third party data to supplement
  CMG's fee and performance analysis that is now based primarily on Lipper
  reports.

 Status: CMG has used data from Morningstar Inc. to compare with data from
 Lipper Inc. ("Lipper") in performing the Trustees' screening procedures.

3.Recommendation: Trustees should consider whether...the fund-by-fund
  screen...should place comparable emphasis on both basis point and quintile
  information in their evaluation of the funds...Also, the Trustees should
  consider incorporating sequences of one-year performance into a fund-by-fund
  screen.

 Status: CMG has not provided Trustees with results of the screening process
 using percentiles. CMG has provided Trustees with information on the changes
 in performance and expenses between 2005 and 2006 and data on oneyear returns.

4.Recommendation: Given the volatility of fund performance, the Trustees may
  want to consider whether a better method exists than th[e] fee waiver process
  to deal with fund underperformance.

 Status: It is my understanding that the Trustees have determined to address
 fund underperformance not only through fee waivers and expense caps but also
 through discussions with CMG regarding the sources of underperformance. CMG
 has provided Trustees with an analysis of the relationship between
 breakpoints, expense reimbursements, and fee waivers.

5.Recommendation: [Seventy-one] percent of funds [have] yet to reach their
  first management fee breakpoint...Trustees may wish to consider whether the
  results of my ongoing economies-of-scale work affects the underlying economic
  assumptions reflected in the existing breakpoint schedules.

 Status: CMG has prepared a memo for the Trustees discussing its views on the
 nature and sharing of potential economies of scale. The memo discuses CMG's
 view that economies of scale arise at the complex level rather than

50

<PAGE>




 the fund level. The memo also describes steps, including the introduction of
 breakpoints, taken to share economies of scale with shareholders. CMG's
 analysis, however, does not discuss specific sources of economies of scale and
 does not link breakpoints to economies of scale that might be realized as the
 Funds' assets increase.

6.Recommendation: Trustees should continue working with management to address
  issues of funds that demonstrate consistent or significant underperformance
  even if the fee levels for the funds are low.

 Status: Trustees monitor performance on an ongoing basis.

  III. Findings

A. General

1.Based upon my examination of the available information and the six factors, I
  conclude that the Trustees have the relevant information necessary to
  evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed management fees for the Funds.
  CMG has provided the Trustees with relevant materials on the six factors
  through the 15(c) contract renewal process and in materials prepared for
  review at Board and Committee meetings.

2.In my view, the process by which the proposed management fees of the Funds
  have been negotiated in 2006 thus far has been, to the extent practicable, at
  arms' length and reasonable and consistent with the AOD.

B. Nature and Quality of Services, Including
Performance
3.The performance of the Funds has been relatively strong, especially that of
  fixed-income Funds. For each of the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year performance
  periods, over 60 percent of the funds have ranked in the top three
  performance quintiles.

4.The performance of the equity Funds overall, though less concentrated in the
  top two quintiles than the fixed-income Funds, improved in 2006 relative to
  that in 2005. The fixedincome funds maintained the relatively high
  performance level of 2005 in 2006.

5.The Funds' overall performance adjusted for risk was significantly stronger
  than performance unadjusted for risk. Domestic and international equity
  funds, in particular, moved to higher relative performance rankings after
  adjusting for risk.

6.The procedure used to construct the performance universe in which each Fund's
  performance is ranked relative to comparable funds may bias a Fund's ranking
  upward within that universe. The bias occurs because the performance ranking
  procedure includes all share classes of multi-class funds in the universe and
  because the procedure ranks either no-load or A share classes of the Funds.
  No-load and A share classes generally have lower total expenses than B and C
  shares (owing to B and C shares having higher distribution/service fees) and
  thus, given all else, would outperform many of B and C share classes included
  in the universe. A preliminary analysis that adjusts for the bias results in
  a downward movement in the relative performance for the Funds but does not
  change the general finding that the Funds' performance has been strong
  relative to comparable funds.

C. Management Fees Charged by Other
Mutual Fund Companies
7.The Funds' management fees and total expenses are generally low relative to
  those of their peers. At least 56 percent of the Funds are in the first or
  second quintiles with the lowest fees and expenses and nearly three-fourths
  or more in the first three quintiles. Equity Funds are more highly
  concentrated in the first three quintiles than fixedincome Funds.

8.The fee and expense rankings as whole are similar to those in 2005 in that
  the majority of funds are ranked in the top quintiles. Nonetheless, a number
  of individual funds experienced a change in ranking between 2005 and 2006.
  This fund-level instability may reflect sensitivity of rankings to the
  composition of the comparison groups, as the membership of the peer groups
  typically changed substantially between the two years.

9.The Liberty Money Market Fund VS appears to have a higher management fee
  structure than that of other Columbia money market funds of comparable asset
  size.

D. Trustees' Fee and Performance Evaluation Process
10.The Trustees' evaluation process identified 21 funds in 2006 for further
   review based upon their relative performance or expenses. Seventeen of these
   funds had been subject to review in 2004 or 2005.

                                                                             51

E. Potential Economies of Scale
11.CMG has prepared a memo for the Trustees containing its views on the sources
   and sharing of potential economies of scale. CMG views economies of scale as
   arising at the complex level and would regard estimates of scale economies
   for individual funds as unreliable. CMG has not, however, identified
   specific sources of economies of scale nor has it provided any estimates of
   the magnitude of any economies of scale. In the memo, CMG also describes
   measures taken by the Trustees and CMG that seek to share any potential
   economies of scale through breakpoints in management fee schedules, expense
   reimbursements, fee waivers, enhanced shareholder services, fund mergers,
   and operational consolidation. These measures, although of significant
   benefit to shareholders, have not been directly linked in the memo to the
   existence, sources, and magnitude of economies of scale.

F. Management Fees Charged to Institutional Clients
12.CMG has provided Trustees with comparisons of mutual fund management fees
   and institutional fees based upon standardized fee schedules and upon actual
   fees. Based upon the information, institutional fees are generally lower
   than the Funds' management fees. This pattern is consistent with the
   economics of the two financial products. Data are not available, however, on
   actual institutional fees at other money managers. Thus, it is not possible
   to determine the extent to which differences between the Funds' management
   fees and institutional fees are consistent with those seen generally in the
   marketplace.

G. Revenues, Expenses, and Profits
13.The financial statements and the methodology underlying their construction
   generally form a sufficient basis for Trustees to evaluate the expenses and
   profitability of the Funds.

  IV. Recommendations

A. Performance
1.Trustees may wish to consider incorporating risk-adjusted measures in their
  evaluation of performance. CMG has begun to prepare reports for the Trustees
  with risk adjustments, which could form the basis for formally including the
  measures in the 15(c) materials. To this end, Trustees may wish to have CMG
  prepare documents explaining risk adjustments and describing their advantages
  and disadvantages.

2.Trustees may wish to consider having CMG evaluate the sensitivity of
  performance rankings to the design of the universe. The preliminary analysis
  contained in the evaluation suggests that the method employed by Lipper, the
  source of performance rankings used by the Trustees, may bias performance
  rankings upward.

B. Economies of Scale
3.Trustees may wish to consider having CMG extend its analysis of economies of
  scale by examining the sources of such economies, if any. Identification of
  the sources may enable the Trustees and CMG to gauge their magnitude. It also
  may enable the Trustees and CMG to build upon past work on standardized fee
  schedules so that the schedules themselves are consistent with any economies
  of scale and their sources. Finally, an extension of the analysis may enable
  the Trustees and CMG to develop a framework that coordinates the use of fee
  waivers and expense caps with the standard fee schedules and with any
  economies of scale and their sources.

C. Institutional Fees
4.Trustees may wish to consider encouraging CMG to build further upon its
  expanded analysis of institutional fees by refining the matching of
  institutional accounts with mutual funds, by dating the establishment of each
  institutional account, and by incorporating other accounts, such as
  subadvisory relationships, trusts, offshore funds, and separately managed
  accounts into the analysis.

D. Profitability
5.Trustees may wish to consider requesting that CMG expand the reporting of
  revenues and expenses to include more line-item detail for management and
  administration, transfer agency, fund accounting, and distribution.

6.Trustees may wish to consider requesting that CMG provide a statement of its
  operations in the 15(c) materials.

7.Trustees may wish to consider the treatment of the revenue sharing with the
  Private Bank of Bank of America in their review of CMG's profitability.

Respectfully submitted,
John D. Rea

APPENDIX

SOURCES OF INFORMATION USED IN THE EVALUATION

The following list generally describes the sources and types of information
that were used in preparing this report.
1.Performance, management fees, and expense ratios for the Funds and comparable
  funds from other fund complexes from Lipper and CMG. The sources of this
  information were CMG and Lipper;

2.CMG's expenses and profitability obtained directly from CMG;

3.Information on CMG's organizational structure;

4.Profitability of publicly traded asset managers from Lipper;

5.Interviews with CMG staff, including members of senior management, legal
  staff, heads of affiliates, portfolio managers, and financial personnel;

6.Documents prepared by CMG for Section 15(c) contract renewals in 2005 and
  2006;

7.Academic research papers, industry publications, professional materials on
  mutual fund operations and profitability, and SEC releases and studies of
  mutual fund expenses

8.Interviews with and documents prepared by Ernst & Young LLP in its review of
  the Private Bank Revenue Sharing Agreement;

9.Discussions with Trustees and attendance at Board and committee meetings
  during which matters pertaining to the evaluation were considered.

In addition, I engaged NERA Economic Consulting ("NERA") to assist me in data
management and analysis. NERA has extensive experience in the mutual fund
industry that provides unique insights and special knowledge pertaining to my
independent analysis of fees, performance, and profitability. I have also
retained attorneys in the Washington, D.C. office of Willkie Farr & Gallagher
LLP as outside counsel to advise me in connection with my evaluation.

Finally, meetings and discussions with CMG staff were informative. My
participation in Board and committee meetings in which Trustees and CMG
management discussed issues relating to management contracts were of great
benefit to the preparation of the evaluation.

                                                                             53

(e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

The registrant's Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the engagement of
the registrant's independent accountants to provide audit and non-audit
services to the registrant and non-audit services to its investment adviser
(not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and
is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser) or any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with such investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the registrant ("Adviser Affiliates"), if the
engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
registrant.

   The Audit Committee has adopted a Policy for Engagement of Independent
Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit Services ("Policy"). The Policy sets forth
the understanding of the Audit Committee regarding the engagement of the
registrant's independent accountants to provide (i) audit and permissible
audit-related, tax and other services to the registrant (collectively "Fund
Services"); (ii) non-audit services to the registrant's investment adviser (not
including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser) and Adviser
Affiliates, if the engagement relates directly to the operations or financial
reporting of a Fund (collectively "Fund-related Adviser Services"); and
(iii) certain other audit and non-audit services to the registrant's investment
adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio
management and is

<PAGE>

subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser) and Adviser
Affiliates. Unless a type of service receives general pre-approval under the
Policy, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be
provided by the independent accountants. Pre-approval of non-audit services to
the registrant, the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted
with or overseen by another investment adviser) and Adviser Affiliates may be
waived provided that the "de minimis" requirements set forth under paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are met.

   Under the Policy, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to
any pre-designated member or members who are Independent Trustees/Directors.
The member(s) to whom such authority is delegated must report, for
informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee
at its next regular meeting. The Audit Committee's responsibilities with
respect to the pre-approval of services performed by the independent
accountants may not be delegated to management.

   The Policy requires the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Board
Administration to submit to the Audit Committee, on an annual basis, a schedule
of the types of services that are subject to general pre-approval. The
schedule(s) provide a description of each type of service that is subject to
general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide estimated fee caps for
each instance of providing each service. The Audit Committees will review and
approve the types of services and review the projected fees for the next fiscal
year and may add to, or subtract from, the list of general pre-approved
services from time to time based on subsequent determinations. That approval
acknowledges that the Audit Committee is in agreement with the specific types
of services that the independent accountants will be permitted to perform.

The Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Board Administration shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was
rendered, including a general description of the services, actual billed and
projected fees, and the means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related
Adviser Services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

                                     *****

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
this Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during both fiscal years ended
November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 was zero.

(f)Not applicable.

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not

<PAGE>

including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that
provides ongoing services to the registrant for the fiscal years ended
November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 are approximately as follows:

                        2006                      2005
                        ----                      ----
                      $523,000                  $271,800

(h) The registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X, is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(58)(A)). Douglas A. Hacker, Thomas E. Stitzel and Anne-Lee Verville are
each independent trustees and collectively constitute the entire Audit
Committee.

Item 6. Schedule of Investments

The registrant's "Schedule I - Investments in securities of unaffiliated
issuers" (as set forth in 17 CFR 210.12-12) is included in Item 1 of this Form
N-CSR.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Fund has delegated to Columbia Management Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") the
responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the
Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the Board of
Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and procedures adopted
by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the Advisor follows when a
vote presents a conflict between the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its
other clients or other persons. The Advisor examines each proposal and votes
against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential

<PAGE>

market value of the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each
proposal and votes the proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the
proposal would be expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund.
The Advisor determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the potential
economic return on the Fund's investment.

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines. For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines the
vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any benefit to
the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. The Advisor
may also address potential material conflicts of interest by delegating the
proxy to an independent third party voting agent.

The Advisor's Proxy Committee is composed of representatives of the Advisor's
investment management team, compliance, legal and fund administration
functions. In addition to the responsibilities described above, the Proxy
Committee has the responsibility to review, at least annually, the Advisor's
proxy voting policies to ensure consistency with internal and regulatory agency
policies and to develop additional predetermined voting guidelines to assist in
the review of proxy proposals.

The Proxy Committee may vary from a predetermined guideline if it determines
that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined guideline would be
expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of the
issuer's securities or to affect adversely the best interest of the client.
References to the best interest of a client refer to the interest of the client
in terms of the potential economic return on the client's investment. In
determining the vote on any proposal, the Proxy Committee does not consider any
benefit other than benefits to the owner of the securities to be voted. A
member of the Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for
which he or she has a conflict of interest by reason of a direct relationship
with the issuer or other party affected by a given proposal. Persons making
recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its members are required to disclose
to the Committee any relationship with a party making a proposal or other
matter known to the person that would create a potential conflict of interest.

The Advisor has retained a third party vendor to implement its proxy voting
process. The vendor provides proxy analysis, record keeping services and vote
disclosure services.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

(a)(1) PORTFOLIO MANAGER

MAUREEN G. NEWMAN, a senior vice president of Columbia Management Advisors,
LLC, is the manager for the Fund and has managed the Fund since August 1998.
Ms. Newman has been associated with Columbia Management Advisors, LLC or its
predecessors since May 1996.

None of these accounts are subject to an advisory fee that is based on the
performance of the account.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN MANAGING MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS

Like other investment professionals with multiple clients, a portfolio manager
for the Fund may face certain potential conflicts of interest in connection
with managing both the Fund and other accounts at the same time. The paragraphs
below describe some of these potential conflicts, which Columbia Management
Advisors, LLC believes are faced by investment professionals at most major
financial firms. Columbia Management Advisors, LLC and the Trustees of the Fund
have adopted compliance policies and procedures that attempt to address certain
of these potential conflicts.

The management of accounts with different advisory fee rates and/or fee
structures, including accounts that pay advisory fees based on account
performance ("performance fee accounts"), may raise potential conflicts of
interest by creating an incentive to favor higher-fee accounts. These potential
conflicts may include, among others:

    .  The most attractive investments could be allocated to higher-fee
       accounts or performance fee accounts.

    .  The trading of higher-fee accounts could be favored as to timing and/or
       execution price. For example, higher-fee accounts could be permitted to
       sell securities earlier than other accounts when a prompt sale is
       desirable or to buy securities at an earlier and more opportune time.

    .  The trading of other accounts could be used to benefit higher-fee
       accounts (front-running).

    .  The investment management team could focus their time and efforts
       primarily on higher-fee accounts due to a personal stake in compensation.

<PAGE>

Potential conflicts of interest may also arise when the portfolio managers have
personal investments in other accounts that may create an incentive to favor
those accounts. As a general matter and subject to limited exceptions, Columbia
Management Advisors, LLC's investment professionals do not have the opportunity
to invest in client accounts, other than the Columbia Funds.

A potential conflict of interest may arise when the Fund and other accounts
purchase or sell the same securities. On occasions when a portfolio manager
considers the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interests of the
Fund as well as other accounts, Columbia Management Advisors, LLC 's trading
desk may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, aggregate
the securities to be sold or purchased in order to obtain the best execution
and lower brokerage commissions, if any. Aggregation of trades may create the
potential for unfairness to the Fund or another account if one account is
favored over another in allocating the securities purchased or sold -- for
example, by allocating a disproportionate amount of a security that is likely
to increase in value to a favored account.

"Cross trades," in which one Columbia account sells a particular security to
another account (potentially saving transaction costs for both accounts), may
also pose a potential conflict of interest. Cross trades may be seen to involve
a potential conflict of interest if, for example, one account is permitted to
sell a security to another account at a higher price than an independent third
party would pay. Columbia Management Advisors, LLC and the Funds' Trustees have
adopted compliance procedures that provide that any transactions between the
Fund and another Columbia-advised account are to be made at an independent
current market price, as required by law.

Another potential conflict of interest may arise based on the different
investment objectives and strategies of the Fund and other accounts. For
example, another account may have a shorter-term investment horizon or
different investment objectives, policies or restrictions than the Fund.
Depending on another account's objectives or other factors, a portfolio manager
may give advice and make decisions that may differ from advice given, or the
timing or nature of decisions made, with respect to the Fund. In addition,
investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic
suitability for the particular account involved. Thus, a particular security
may be bought or sold for certain accounts even though it could have been
bought or sold for other accounts at the same time. More rarely, a particular
security may be bought for one or more accounts managed by a portfolio manager
when one or more other accounts are selling the security (including short
sales). There may be circumstances when purchases or sales of portfolio
securities for one or more accounts may have an adverse effect on other
accounts.

The Fund's portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple funds
and/or accounts may devote unequal time and attention to the management of
those funds and/or accounts. As a result, the portfolio manager may not be able
to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment
opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the case if he or she were
to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single fund. The
effects of this potential conflict may be more

<PAGE>

pronounced where funds and/or accounts overseen by a particular portfolio
manager have different investment strategies.

The Fund's portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection
of the brokers and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for
the Fund. In addition to executing trades, some brokers and dealers provide
portfolio managers with brokerage and research services (as those terms are
defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), which may
result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise be
available. These services may be more beneficial to certain funds or accounts
than to others. Although the payment of brokerage commissions is subject to the
requirement that the portfolio manager determine in good faith that the
commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research services provided to the fund, a portfolio manager's decision as to
the selection of brokers and dealers could yield disproportionate costs and
benefits among the funds and/or accounts that he or she manages.

Columbia Management Advisors, LLC or an affiliate may provide more services
(such as distribution or recordkeeping) for some types of funds or accounts
than for others. In such cases, a portfolio manager may benefit, either
directly or indirectly, by devoting disproportionate attention to the
management of fund and/or accounts that provide greater overall returns to the
investment manager and its affiliates.

The Fund's portfolio manager(s) may also face other potential conflicts of
interest in managing the Fund, and the description above is not a complete
description of every conflict that could be deemed to exist in managing both
the Fund and other accounts. In addition, the Fund's portfolio manager may also
manage other accounts (including their personal assets or the assets of family
members) in their personal capacity. The management of these accounts may also
involve certain of the potential conflicts described above. Investment
personnel at Columbia Management Advisors, LLC, including the Fund's portfolio
manager, are subject to restrictions on engaging in personal securities
transactions pursuant to Codes of Ethics adopted by the Columbia Management
Advisors, LLC and the Fund, which contain provisions and requirements designed
to identify and address certain conflicts of interest between personal
investment activities and the interests of the Fund.

(3) COMPENSATION

As of the Fund's most recent fiscal year end, the portfolio manager received
all of her compensation from Columbia Management Advisors, LLC and its parent
company, Columbia Management Group, in the form of salary, bonus, stock options
and restricted stock. A portfolio manager's bonus is variable and is generally
based on (1) an evaluation of the manager's investment performance and (2) the
results of a peer and/or management review of such individual, which takes into
account skills and attributes such as team participation, investment process,
communication and professionalism. In evaluating investment performance,
Columbia Management Advisors, LLC generally considers the one-, three- and
five-year performance of mutual funds and other accounts

<PAGE>

under the portfolio manager's oversight relative to the benchmarks and peer
groups noted below, emphasizing the manager's three- and five-year performance.
Columbia Management Advisors, LLC may also consider the portfolio manager's
performance in managing client assets in sectors and industries assigned to the
manager as part of her investment team responsibilities, where applicable. For
portfolio managers who also have group management responsibilities, another
factor in their evaluation is an assessment of the group's overall investment
performance.

The size of the overall bonus pool each year is determined by Columbia
Management Group and depends in part on levels of compensation generally in the
investment management industry (based on market compensation data) and Columbia
Management Advisors, LLC 's profitability for the year, which is influenced by
assets under management.

EXCHANGE-LISTED CLOSED-END FUNDS

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

Board Approval Received December 2005
Version Effective Date  January 3, 2006
Date Last Reviewed      January 3, 2006
Applicable Authority    Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
                        Item 2 of Form N-CSR

Overview and Statement

Item 2 of Form N-CSR, the form used by registered management investment
companies to file certified shareholder reports, requires a registered
management investment company to disclose (1) whether it has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to the investment company's principal executive officer and
senior financial officers and, if it has not adopted such a code of ethics, why
it has not done so, and (2) any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of
ethics relating to such officers.

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following Code of Ethics, which sets
forth the ethical standards to which the Fund holds its principal executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

Fund Level Policies and Procedures

I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer or
Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

    .  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
       apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
       relationships;

    .  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
       and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in
       other public communications made by the Fund;

    .  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

    .  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
       appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

<PAGE>

    .  accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or apparent
conflicts of interest.

II. Administration of the Code

   The Board has designated an individual to be primarily responsible for the
administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). In the absence of the Code
Officer, his or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
temporary basis.

   The Board has designated a person who meets the definition of a chief legal
officer (the "CLO") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
rules promulgated thereunder as the Fund's CLO. The CLO of the Fund shall
assist the Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Code
Officer, in consultation with the CLO, shall be responsible for applying this
Code to specific situations (in consultation with Fund counsel, where
appropriate) and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular
situation.

III. Managing Conflicts of Interest

   Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's personal
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain provisions in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Advisers Act and the rules and regulations thereunder govern certain
conflicts of interest that arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and its Adviser's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and conduct that is consistent
with such programs and procedures falls outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationships between the Fund and, as applicable, its Adviser, administrator,
principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
(each, a "Primary Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for

                                      2

<PAGE>

the Fund or for a Primary Service Provider, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Primary Service Providers and the Fund. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationships between the Fund and the Primary Service Providers and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of
the Fund that the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or
more other investment companies or organizations affiliated with the sponsor of
the Fund covered by other similar codes and that the codes of ethics of those
other investment companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers
acting in such capacities for such other investment companies.

   This Code covers conflicts of interest that are not subject to provisions in
the 1940 Act and Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such conflicts of interest follow.

   Each Covered Officer must:

    .  not knowingly use his or her personal influence or personal
       relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
       reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer, or a member of his or
       her family, would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

    .  not knowingly cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
       the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer, or a member of
       his or her family, rather than the benefit of the Fund;

    .  not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
       contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
       personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions;
       and

    .  report at least annually (or more frequently, as appropriate) known
       affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of
       interest with respect to the Fund.

   If a Covered Officer believes that he or she has a potential conflict of
interest that is likely to materially compromise his or her objectivity or his
or her ability to perform the duties of his or her role as a Covered Officer,
including a potential conflict of interest that arises out of his or her
responsibilities as an officer or employee of one or more Primary Service
Providers or other funds, he or she should consult with the Code Officer, the
CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent Board Members,
as appropriate.

                                      3

<PAGE>

   Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially compromise
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer and which the
Covered Officer should consider discussing with the Code Officer or other
appropriate person include:

    .  service as a director on the board of a public or private company or
       service as a public official;

    .  the receipt of a non-de minimis gift when the gift is in relation to
       doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

    .  the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Fund has
       current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is
       business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place,
       and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

    .  an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the Primary
       Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and

    .  a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
       transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
       equity ownership.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

    It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

    .  to familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
       generally applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and financial
       operations of the Fund;

    .  to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others to
       misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or outside
       the Fund, including to the Fund's Board, legal counsel, legal counsel to
       the Independent Board Members and auditors, and to governmental
       regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

    .  to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility,
       consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the Primary
       Service Providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
       timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
       Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
       communications made by the Fund; and

                                      4

<PAGE>

    .  to adhere to and, within his or her area of responsibility, promote
       compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
       laws, rules and regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

   Each Covered Officer must:

    .  upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer, acknowledge in
       writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has received, read and
       understands the Code, using the form attached as Appendix I hereto;

    .  annually thereafter acknowledge in writing to the Fund's Board that he
       or she has received and read the Code and believes that he or she has
       complied with the requirements of the Code, using the form attached as
       Appendix II hereto;

    .  not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
       potential violations that are made in good faith; and

    .  notify the Code Officer promptly if he or she knows of any violation, or
       of conduct that reasonably could be expected to be or result in a
       violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

   The Fund will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

    .  The Code Officer will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
       investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

    .  If, after such investigation, the Code Officer believes that no
       violation has occurred, the Code Officer will so notify the person(s)
       reporting the potential violation, and no further action is required;

    .  Any matter that the Code Officer, upon consultation with the CLO,
       believes is a violation will be reported by the Code Officer or the CLO
       to the Fund's Audit Committee;

    .  If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
       inform and make a recommendation to the Fund's Board, which will
       consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
       appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
       notification to the appropriate personnel of the Fund's Primary Service
       Providers or their boards; a recommendation to censure, suspend or
       dismiss the Covered Officer; or referral of the matter to the
       appropriate authorities for civil action or criminal prosecution;

                                      5

<PAGE>

       .  The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers,
          as appropriate; and

       .  This Code and any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the
          extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

   The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit Committee quarterly any
violations of, or material issues arising under, this Code.

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

   This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for the
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered management investment companies thereunder. Insofar as
other polices or procedures of the Fund or the Fund's Primary Service Providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent
that they conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Fund's and its
Adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under
the 1940 Act and the more detailed policies and procedures of the Primary
Service Providers as set forth in their respect Compliance Manuals are separate
