                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2005

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com/funds.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2005.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.  (the  "Equity  Trust") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Maryland
corporation on May 20, 1986 and registered  under the Investment  Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  whose primary  objective is long-term growth
of capital. Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

      The  Equity  Trust  will  invest  at least  80% of its  assets  in  equity
securities under normal market conditions (the "80% Policy"). The 80% Policy may
be  changed  without  shareholder  approval.   The  Equity  Trust  will  provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Equity Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") so  determines,  by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith, to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") .

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close of the foreign  markets,  but prior to the close
of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change
significantly,  certain  foreign  securities  may be  fair  valued  pursuant  to
procedures  established by the Board. Debt instruments with remaining maturities
of 60 days or less that are not credit  impaired are valued at  amortized  cost,
unless the Board  determines such amount does not reflect the  securities'  fair
value,  in which  case  these  securities  will be valued at their fair value as
determined by the Board. Debt instruments having a maturity greater than 60 days
for which market  quotations are readily  available are valued at the average of
the latest bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked prices  quoted on such
day, the security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures  contracts are
valued at the  closing  settlement  price of the  exchange  or board of trade on
which the applicable contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board. Fair
valuation  methodologies  and  procedures  may include,  but are not limited to:
analysis and review of available  financial and non-financial  information about
the company;  comparisons  to the  valuation and changes in valuation of similar
securities,  including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S.
dollar value ADR securities at the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of
any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.   The  Equity  Trust  may  enter  into  repurchase
agreements with primary government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal
Reserve Board,  with member banks of the Federal Reserve  System,  or with other
brokers or dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the Adviser and
reviewed by the Board.  Under the terms of a typical repurchase  agreement,  the
Equity Trust takes  possession of an underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an
obligation  of the seller to  repurchase,  and the Equity  Trust to resell,  the
obligation  at an  agreed-upon  price and time,  thereby  determining  the yield
during the Equity Trust's holding  period.  The Equity Trust will always receive
and maintain  securities as collateral  whose market  value,  including  accrued
interest,  will be at least equal in value to the dollar amount  invested by the
Equity  Trust in each  agreement.  The Equity  Trust will make  payment for such
securities  only upon physical  delivery or upon evidence of book entry transfer
of the  collateral  to the  account of the  custodian.  To the  extent  that any
repurchase  transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is
marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral. If
the seller  defaults and the value of the  collateral  declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Equity Trust may be delayed or limited.

      SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Equity Trust may enter into interest rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Equity  Trust would  agree to pay to the other party to the  interest
rate  swap  (which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate
payment in exchange  for the  counterparty  agreeing to pay to the Equity  Trust
periodically a variable rate payment that is intended to approximate  the Equity
Trust's variable rate payment  obligation on the Series C Preferred Stock. In an
interest rate cap, the Equity Trust would pay a premium to the counterparty and,
to the extent that a specified


                                       13

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

variable rate index exceeds a predetermined  fixed rate,  would receive from the
counterparty  payments of the  difference  based on the notional  amount of such
cap. Interest rate swap and cap transactions  introduce  additional risk because
the Equity Trust would remain  obligated to pay preferred  stock  dividends when
due in  accordance  with the  Articles  Supplementary  even if the  counterparty
defaulted.  If there is a default by the  counterparty  to a swap contract,  the
Equity Trust will be limited to contractual  remedies pursuant to the agreements
related  to  the  transaction.There  is no  assurance  that  the  swap  contract
counterparties  will be able to meet  their  obligations  pursuant  to the  swap
contracts  or that,  in the event of default,  the Equity  Trust will succeed in
pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Equity Trust thus assumes the risk that it
may be delayed in or prevented  from  obtaining  payments owed to it pursuant to
the swap contracts.  The creditworthiness of the swap contract counterparties is
closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on the general state
of short-term  interest  rates and the returns on the Equity  Trust's  portfolio
securities  at that point in time,  such a default could  negatively  affect the
Equity  Trust's  ability to make  dividend  payments  for the Series C Preferred
Stock. In addition, at the time an interest rate swap or cap transaction reaches
its scheduled  termination  date, there is a risk that the Equity Trust will not
be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that the terms of the replacement
will not be as  favorable  as on the expiring  transaction.  If this occurs,  it
could have a  negative  impact on the Equity  Trust's  ability to make  dividend
payments on the Series C Preferred Stock.

      The use of derivative  instruments involves, to varying degrees,  elements
of market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability on the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements. Swap
agreements  involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements of market and  counterparty
risk,  and  exposure to loss in excess of the related  amounts  reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

      The Equity Trust has entered into one interest  rate swap  agreement  with
Citibank N.A.  Under the agreement the Equity Trust  receives a floating rate of
interest  and pays a respective  fixed rate of interest on the nominal  value of
the swap. Details of the swap at December 31, 2005 are as follows:

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Equity Trust may engage in futures  contracts for
the purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities
and in the value of securities  it intends to purchase.  Such  investments  will
only be made if they are  economically  appropriate  to the  reduction  of risks
involved in the management of the Equity Trust's investments. Upon entering into
a futures  contract,  the Equity Trust is required to deposit with the broker an
amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract
amount. This is known as the "initial margin."  Subsequent payments  ("variation
margin")  are made or received by the Equity  Trust each day,  depending  on the
daily  fluctuation  of the  value of the  contract.  The  daily  changes  in the
contract are included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and
futures contracts.  The Equity Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when the
contract is closed.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged  investments.  These  contracts
may involve  market risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss reflected in
the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.  In  addition,  there is the risk the
Equity Trust may not be able to enter into a closing  transaction  because of an
illiquid  secondary  market.  At December 31,  2005,  there were no open futures
contracts.

      FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Equity Trust may engage in forward
foreign  exchange  contracts for hedging a specific  transaction with respect to
either the currency in which the transaction is denominated or another  currency
as deemed  appropriate by the Adviser.  Forward foreign  exchange  contracts are
valued at the forward rate and are marked-to-market  daily. The change in market
value is included in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and
foreign  currency  translations.  When the contract is closed,  the Equity Trust
records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations  in  the  underlying   prices  of  the  Equity  Trust's   portfolio
securities, but it does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the
future.  Although forward foreign exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due
to a decline in the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential
gain  that  might  result  should  the  value of the  currency  increase.  These
contracts  may  involve  market  risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss
reflected in the Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.  In addition,  the Equity
Trust  could be  exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the  contracts  are
unable to meet the terms of their contracts. At December 31, 2005, there were no
open forward foreign exchange contracts.

      FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The books and records of the Equity Trust
are maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies, investments,
and other assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current
exchange  rates.  Purchases  and sales of  investment  securities,  income,  and
expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective  dates
of such  transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from changes in
foreign  exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting
from changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Equity  Trust and the  amounts  actually
received.   The  portion  of  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  related  to
fluctuation in exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent sale
trade date is included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Equity Trust may directly purchase securities of
foreign  issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves  special
risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The
risks include  possible  revaluation  of  currencies,  the ability to repatriate
funds, less complete financial information about companies,  and possible future
adverse  political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many
foreign  issuers  and their  markets  may be less  liquid and their  prices more
volatile than those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

      FOREIGN TAXES. The Equity Trust may be subject to foreign taxes on income,
gains on  investments,  or  currency  repatriation,  a  portion  of which may be
recoverable.  The  Equity  Trust  will  accrue  such  taxes  and  recoveries  as
applicable,  based upon its current  interpretation of tax rules and regulations
that exist in the markets in which it invests.

      RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES.  The Equity Trust may invest up to 10%
of its net assets in  securities  for which the markets are  illiquid.  Illiquid
securities include securities the disposition of which is subject to substantial
legal  or  contractual  restrictions.  The  sale of  illiquid  securities  often
requires more time and results in higher  brokerage  charges or dealer discounts
and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading
on national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets.  Restricted
securities  may  sell at a price  lower  than  similar  securities  that are not
subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities  freely saleable among qualified
institutional  investors  under  special  rules  adopted by the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity
standards  established by the Board. The continued  liquidity of such securities
is not as well assured as that of publicly  traded  securities,  and accordingly
the Board will monitor their liquidity.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums and discounts on debt  securities are amortized using the yield
to maturity  method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date except
for certain dividends which are recorded as soon as the Trust is informed of the
dividend.

      CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS.  When cash  balances are  maintained in the custody
account,  the Equity Trust receives  credits which are used to offset  custodian
fees.  The gross  expenses  paid under the custody  arrangement  are included in
custodian  fees in the Statement of Operations  with the  corresponding  expense
offset shown as "custodian fee credits".

      DIVIDENDS  AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common
shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and
capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with Federal income tax
regulations which may differ from that determined under U.S.  generally accepted
accounting  principles.   These  differences  are  primarily  due  to  differing
treatments  of income and gains on  various  investment  securities  held by the
Equity Trust, foreign currency transactions,  timing differences,  and differing
characterizations  of  distributions  made by the Equity Trust.  These  book/tax
differences  are either  temporary or  permanent in nature.  To the extent these
differences  are  permanent,  adjustments  are made to the  appropriate  capital
accounts in the period when the differences arise. These  reclassifications have
no impact on the NAV of the Equity Trust and the  calculation  of net investment
income per share in the Financial Highlights includes these adjustments. For the
year  ended  December  31,  2005,   reclassifications   were  made  to  decrease
accumulated  net  investment  income  by  $2,052,100  and  decrease  accumulated
distributions in excess of net realized gain on investments,  futures contracts,
swap contracts, and foreign currency transactions by $2,052,100.

      Distributions  to  shareholders  of the  Equity  Trust's  7.20%  Series  B
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series C Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock,
5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock ("Cumulative Preferred Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and
are determined as described in Note 5.

      PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Equity  Trust  intends to  continue  to
qualify as a regulated  investment  company  under  Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  It is the Equity  Trust's policy
to comply with the  requirements of the Code applicable to regulated  investment
companies  and to distribute  substantially  all of its net  investment  company
taxable income and net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income
taxes is required.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Equity Trust has entered
into an  investment  advisory  agreement  (the  "Advisory  Agreement")  with the
Adviser  which  provides  that the  Equity  Trust  will pay the  Adviser  a fee,
computed weekly and paid monthly, equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value
of the Equity Trust's average weekly net assets including the liquidation  value
of preferred  stock.  In  accordance  with the Advisory  Agreement,  the Adviser
provides a continuous  investment  program for the Equity Trust's  portfolio and
oversees the  administration  of all aspects of the Equity Trust's  business and
affairs.  The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee on the incremental
assets attributable to the Cumulative Preferred Stock if the total return of the
net  asset  value  of  the  common  shares  of  the  Equity   Trust,   including
distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed the stated
dividend  rate or  corresponding  swap  rate of each  particular  series  of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

      The  Equity  Trust's  total  return on the net asset  value of the  common
shares is monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the
net asset  value of the  common  shares  exceeds  the  stated  dividend  rate or
corresponding swap rate of each particular series of Cumulative  Preferred Stock
for the period.  For the year ended  December 31, 2005, the Equity Trust's total
return on the net asset value of the common shares  exceeded the stated dividend
rate or net swap  expense of Series C and E Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Thus,  management fees were accrued on these assets.  The Equity Trust's
total  return on the net asset  value of the  common  shares  did not exceed the
stated  dividend  rate or  corresponding  swap rate of 7.20% Series B and 5.875%
Series D Cumulative  Preferred Stock. Thus,  management fees with respect to the
liquidation value of the preferred stock assets were reduced by $2,387,425.

      During  the year  ended  December  31,  2005,  Gabelli  &  Company,  Inc.,
("Gabelli  &  Company")  an  affiliate  of the  Adviser,  received  $469,081  in
brokerage  commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio
securities on behalf of the Equity Trust.

      In  connection  with the  2005  Rights  Offering  ("Rights"),  holders  of
unexercised  rights to purchase Common Shares of the Trust were able to instruct
the Subscription Agent (Computershare  Shareholder Services,  Inc.) to sell such
Rights on their  behalf.  The  Subscription  Agent was  permitted to effect such
sales  through  Gabelli &  Company,  unless the  Subscription  Agent was able to
negotiate a lower commission rate with an independent broker.  Total commissions
from  sales of Rights  effected  by the  Subscription  Agent  through  Gabelli &
Company amounted to $93,506 for the year ended December 31, 2005.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

      The cost of calculating the Equity Trust's net asset value per share is an
Equity Trust expense pursuant to the Advisory  Agreement.  During the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Equity Trust reimbursed the Adviser $45,000 in connection
with the cost of computing the Equity Trust's net asset value, which is included
in miscellaneous expenses in the Statement of Operations.

      The Equity  Trust is  assuming  its portion of the  allocated  cost of the
Gabelli  Funds' Chief  Compliance  Officer in the amount of $27,008 for the year
ended December 31, 2005,  which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement
of Operations.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.  Cost of  purchases  and  proceeds  from the sales of
securities,  other than short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31,
2005 aggregated $467,095,671 and $343,532,624, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The charter permits the Equity Trust to issue 182,000,000 shares of
common  stock  (par value  $0.001)  and  authorizes  the Board to  increase  its
authorized  shares  from  time to  time.  The  Board  of the  Equity  Trust  has
authorized  the  repurchase of its shares on the open market when the shares are
trading at a discount of 10% or more (or such other  percentage as the Board may
determine from time to time) from the net asset value of the shares.  During the
year ended  December 31, 2005, the Equity Trust did not repurchase any shares of
its common stock in the open market.

Transactions in common stock were as follows:

      The Equity Trust's Articles of  Incorporation,  as amended,  authorize the
issuance of up to  18,000,000  shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The Cumulative  Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and results
in the  financial  leveraging  of the common  stock.  Such  leveraging  tends to
magnify both the risks and  opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on
shares of the Cumulative  Preferred  Stock are  cumulative.  The Equity Trust is
required by the 1940 Act and by the Articles Supplementary to meet certain asset
coverage tests with respect to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Equity
Trust fails to meet these  requirements  and does not correct such failure,  the
Equity Trust may be required to redeem,  in part or in full, the 7.20% Series B,
Series C Auction  Rate,  5.875%  Series D, and Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock  at  redemption  prices  of $25,  $25,000,  $25,  and  $25,000,
respectively,  per share  plus an amount  equal to the  accumulated  and  unpaid
dividends  whether  or not  declared  on such  shares  in  order  to meet  these
requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet the foregoing  asset  requirements
could  restrict  the  Equity   Trust's   ability  to  pay  dividends  to  common
shareholders  and could lead to sales of  portfolio  securities  at  inopportune
times.  The income  received on the Equity  Trust's  assets may vary in a manner
unrelated to the fixed and variable  preferred  dividend rates, which could have
either a beneficial or  detrimental  impact on net  investment  income and gains
available to common shareholders.

      On September 21, 2005, the Trust  distributed one  transferable  right for
each of the  143,681,301  shares of common stock  outstanding to shareholders of
record on that date.  Seven  rights were  required to  purchase  one  additional
common  share at the  subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders  who
exercised  their  full  primary   subscription   rights  were  eligible  for  an
over-subscription  privilege  entitling  them to  subscribe,  subject to certain
limitations and a pro-rata  allotment,  for any additional  shares not purchased
pursuant to the primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as authorized
by the Board in accordance with the  registration  statement.  The  subscription
period  expired on October 26, 2005. The rights  offering was fully  subscribed,
having received over-subscription requests in excess of the shares available for
primary  subscription  resulting in the issuance of 20,525,901  shares of common
stock and proceeds of $143,681,307  to the Equity Trust,  prior to the deduction
of estimated  expenses of  $600,000.  The net asset value per share of the Trust
common  shareholders was reduced by approximately $0.15 per share as a result of
the issuance of shares below net asset value.

      On June 20, 2001, the Equity Trust  received net proceeds of  $159,329,175
(after  underwriting  discounts of $5,197,500 and offering expenses of $473,325)
from the  public  offering  of  6,600,000  shares of 7.20%  Series B  Cumulative
Preferred Stock.  Commencing June 20, 2006 and thereafter,  the Equity Trust, at
its option, may redeem the 7.20% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or
in part at the redemption price at any time.  During the year ended December 31,
2005,  the  Equity  Trust  did not  repurchase  any  shares  of  7.20%  Series B
Cumulative  Preferred Stock. At December 31, 2005, 6,600,000 shares of the 7.20%
Series B  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  outstanding  and accrued  dividends
amounted to $165,000.

      On June 27, 2002, the Equity Trust  received net proceeds of  $128,246,557
(after  underwriting  discounts of $1,300,000 and offering expenses of $453,443)
from the public  offering of 5,200  shares of Series C Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is
generally held every 7 days, is expected to vary with short-term interest rates.

from the public  offering of 2,000  shares of Series E Auction  Rate  Cumulative

      The holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Equity  Trust and will vote  together  with  holders of common stock as a single
class.  The holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single
class also have the right  currently to elect two  Directors  and under  certain
circumstances  are  entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Directors.  In
addition, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by
holders of all  outstanding  shares of the preferred  stock,  voting as a single
class,  will  be  required  to  approve  any  plan of  reorganization  adversely
affecting  the  preferred  stock,  and the approval of two-thirds of each class,
voting separately,  of the Equity Trust's  outstanding voting stock must approve
the  conversion of the Equity Trust from a closed-end to an open-end  investment
company.  The  approval  of a  majority  (as  defined  in the  1940  Act) of the
outstanding  preferred  stock and a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the
Equity Trust's  outstanding  voting  securities are required to approve  certain
other actions,  including changes in the Equity Trust's investment objectives or
fundamental investment policies.

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Equity  Trust  enters into  contracts  that contain a
variety of  indemnifications.  The Equity Trust's  maximum  exposure under these
arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Equity Trust has not had prior claims or
losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7.   REORGANIZATION.   On  September  13,  2005,   the  Equity  Trust   acquired
substantially all of the net assets of the Sterling Capital Corp.  pursuant to a
Plan of Reorganization approved by Sterling Capital Corp. on September 12, 2005.
The acquisition  was  accomplished  by a tax-free  exchange of 1,978,190  common
shares of the  Equity  Trust  valued at  $18,306,860  for the net  assets of the
Sterling  Capital  Corp.  on September 12, 2005.  Sterling  Capital  Corp.'s net
assets of $18,306,860,  including  $2,191,264 of unrealized  appreciation,  were
combined  with those of the Equity Trust on September  13, 2005.  The net assets
attributable to common stock shareholders of the Equity Trust immediately before
the acquisition were $1,273,163,812.

8. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund trading  practices  involving  certain funds managed by the Adviser.
GAMCO  Investors,  Inc., the Adviser's  parent  company,  is responding to these
requests for documents and testimony.  On a separate matter,  in September 2005,
the Adviser was informed by the staff of the SEC that the staff may recommend to
the Commission that an  administrative  remedy and a monetary  penalty be sought
from the Adviser in connection with the actions of two of seven closed-end funds
managed by the Adviser relating to Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 of the 1940 Act.
These  provisions  require  registered  investment  companies to provide written
statements to shareholders  when a dividend is made from a source other than net
investment  income.  While the two closed-end  funds sent annual  statements and
provided other  materials  containing this  information,  the funds did not send
written  statements to shareholders with each distribution in 2002 and 2003. The
Adviser  believes  that all of the  funds  are now in  compliance.  The  Adviser
believes  that these  matters  would  have no effect on the Equity  Trust or any
material  adverse  effect on the  Adviser  or its  ability  to manage the Equity
Trust. The staff's notice to the Adviser did not relate to the Equity Trust.

+     Based on net asset value per share, adjusted for reinvestment of
      distributions, at prices dependent upon the relationship of the net asset
      value per share and the market value per share on the ex-dividend dates,
      including the effect of shares issued pursuant to 2001 and 2005 rights
      offering, assuming full subscription by shareholder.

++    Based on market value per share, adjusted for reinvestment of
      distributions, including the effect of shares issued pursuant to 2001 and
      2005 rights offering, assuming full subscription by shareholder.

(a)   Amount represents less than $0.005 per share.

(b)   Based on weekly prices.

(c)   The ratios do not include a reduction of expenses for custodian fee
      credits on cash balances maintained with the custodian. Including such
      custodian fee credits for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
      ratios of operating expenses to average net assets attributable to common
      stock net of fee reduction would be 1.19% and 1.11%, respectively, and the
      ratios of operating expenses to average total net assets including
      liquidation value of preferred shares net of fee reduction would be 0.87%
      and 0.94%, respectively. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005,
      2004, and 2003, the effect of the custodian fee credits was minimal.

(d)   Asset coverage is calculated by combining all series of preferred stock.

(e)   Calculated based upon average common shares outstanding on the record
      dates throughout the year.

                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of The Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.
(hereafter  referred to as the "Trust") at December 31, 2005, the results of its
operations  for the year then  ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial  highlights for each of
the periods  presented,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the  United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and
financial highlights  (hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the
responsibility of the Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  financial  statements in  accordance  with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2005 by  correspondence  with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SERIES C AND E AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

      Auction Rate Preferred  Shares pay dividends weekly based on a rate set at
auction,  usually held every seven days.  The  percentage of 2005  distributions
derived from long-term  capital gains for the Series C and Series E Auction Rate
Preferred Shares was 89.39%.

      A Form 1099-DIV has been mailed to all  shareholders  of record which sets
forth specific  amounts to be included in the 2005 tax returns.  Ordinary income
distributions  include net investment income and realized net short-term capital
gains.  Ordinary  income is reported in box 1a of Form  1099-DIV.  Capital  gain
distributions are reported in box 2a of Form 1099-DIV.

CORPORATE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION, QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME AND U.S.
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INCOME

      In 2005, the  Equity  Trust paid to  common,  7.200%  Series B, and 5.875%
Series D preferred shareholders ordinary income totaling $0.09428, $0.19080, and
$0.15575 per share, respectively.  The Equity Trust paid weekly distributions to
Series C and Series E preferred  shareholders  at varying rates  throughout  the
year, including an ordinary income dividend totaling $89.74670 and $89.13380 per
share, respectively,  in 2005. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, 100%
of the ordinary income dividend  qualified for the dividend  received  deduction
available to  corporations,  and 100% of the ordinary  income  distribution  was
deemed qualified dividend income and is reported in box 1b on Form 1099-DIV. The
percentage of the ordinary income dividends paid by the Equity Trust during 2005
derived from U.S.  Government  Securities was 1.63%.  Such income is exempt from
state and local tax in all states. However, many states,  including New York and
California,  allow a tax  exemption for a portion of the income earned only if a
mutual fund has  invested at least 50% of its assets at the end of each  quarter
of the Equity  Trust's  fiscal year in U.S.  Government  Securities.  The Equity
Trust did not meet this  strict  requirement  in 2005.  The  percentage  of U.S.
Government  Securities held as of December 31, 2005 was 0.00%. The percentage of
U.S. Government Securities held as of December 31, 2005 was 4.09%.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust  Inc.   ("Trust")  to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you automatically  become a participant in the Trust's
Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Trust
to issue Common Stock to participants upon an income dividend or a capital gains
distribution  regardless  of whether  the shares are  trading at a discount or a
premium to net asset value. All  distributions to shareholders  whose shares are
registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested  pursuant to the
Plan in additional  shares of the Trust.  Plan participants may send their stock
certificates to Computershare Trust Company N.A. ("Computershare") to be held in
their dividend reinvestment account.  Registered shareholders wishing to receive
their distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                          The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.
                                c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

      If your shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in your  own name  your  distributions  will be  automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of shares of Common Stock  distributed to  participants  in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner.  Under the
Plan,  whenever  the market  price of the  Trust's  Common  Stock is equal to or
exceeds  net  asset  value  at the  time  shares  are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of Common Stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Trust's Common Stock. The valuation date is
the  dividend or  distribution  payment  date or, if that date is not a New York
Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE")  trading  day,  the next trading day. If the net asset
value of the Common Stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds the market price of
the Common  Stock,  participants  will  receive  shares from the Trust valued at
market  price.  If  the  Trust  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution  payable only in cash,  Computershare  will buy Common Stock in the
open market, or on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts, except
that Computershare  will endeavor to terminate  purchases in the open market and
cause  the  Trust  to  issue  shares  at  net  asset  value  if,  following  the
commencement of such purchases, the market value of the Common Stock exceeds the
then current net asset value.

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders to increase their  investment in the Trust. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to Computershare  for investments in the Trust's Common
Stock at the then current  market  price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  Computershare  will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market  on or about  the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will
charge each  shareholder who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage  commissions.  Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any  voluntary  cash  payments  be  sent  to  Computershare,   P.O.  Box  43010,
Providence,  RI  02940-3010  such  that  Computershare  receives  such  payments
approximately  10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month.  Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase  date. A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is
received  by  Computershare  at least  48 hours  before  such  payment  is to be
invested.

      SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your request your name,  address,  and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Trust.

      The Trust  reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by  Computershare on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

         non-audit  services  to the  Chairperson  of  the  Committee,  and  the
         Chairperson  must  report  to  the  Committee,  at its  next  regularly
         scheduled  meeting  after  the   Chairperson's   pre-approval  of  such
         services,  his or her  decision(s).  The Committee  may also  establish
         detailed  pre-approval policies and procedures for pre-approval of such
         services in accordance with applicable  laws,  including the delegation
         of some or all of the Committee's pre-approval  responsibilities to the
         other  persons  (other  than  Gabelli  or the  registrant's  officers).
         Pre-approval by the Committee of any permissible  non-audit services is
         not  required  so  long  as:  (i)  the  aggregate  amount  of all  such
         permissible non-audit services provided to the registrant,  Gabelli and
         any Covered Services Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total
         amount of revenues paid by the registrant to its  independent  auditors
         during the fiscal year in which the permissible  non-audit services are
         provided;  (ii) the permissible  non-audit services were not recognized
         by  the  registrant  at the  time  of the  engagement  to be  non-audit

         engagement to audit the registrant's  financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were  attributed  to work  performed by persons
         other than the principal  accountant's  full-time,  permanent employees
         was zero percent (0%).

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services  rendered to the registrant,  and rendered to the registrant's
         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  registrant  for  each  of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the
         registrant was $0 in 2005 and $0 in 2004.

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.
<PAGE>

                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt  written  policies and  procedures  governing  the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Asset  Management Inc.,  Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities,  Inc., and Gabelli Advisers, Inc. (collectively,
the  "Advisers")  to  determine  how  to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict  between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the  Advisers;  the  principal  underwriter;  or any  affiliated  person  of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the  Advisers do not have  voting  discretion  or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific  guidelines  or  procedures  supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

The Proxy Voting  Committee was originally  formed in April 1989 for the purpose
of formulating  guidelines and reviewing proxy statements  within the parameters
set by the substantive  proxy voting  guidelines  originally  published by GAMCO
Investors,  Inc. in 1988 and updated periodically,  a copy of which are appended
as  Exhibit  A.  The  Committee  will  include   representatives   of  Research,
Administration,  Legal, and the Advisers.  Additional or replacement  members of
the  Committee  will be  nominated  by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire
Committee.

           Meetings  are held as  needed  basis to form  views on the  manner in
which the Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

         In general,  the  Director of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using the Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters  identified by the Chairman of the Committee,  the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

A.                CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

                                    The Advisers  have  implemented  these proxy
                  voting  procedures  in order to prevent  conflicts of interest
                  from influencing  their proxy voting  decisions.  By following
                  the Proxy Guidelines,  as well as the  recommendations of ISS,
                  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of  Gabelli &
                  Company,  the Advisers are able to avoid,  wherever  possible,
                  the   influence   of   potential    conflicts   of   interest.
                  Nevertheless,  circumstances may arise in which one or more of
                  the  Advisers  are faced with a conflict  of  interest  or the
                  appearance  of a conflict of interest in  connection  with its
                  vote.  In general,  a conflict  of interest  may arise when an
                  Adviser knowingly does business with an issuer, and may appear
                  to have a material  conflict between its own interests and the
                  interests of the shareholders of an investment company managed
                  by one of the Advisers regarding how the proxy is to be voted.
                  A conflict also may exist when an Adviser has actual knowledge
                  of a material  business  arrangement  between an issuer and an
                  affiliate of the Adviser.

                  In  practical  terms,  a conflict of interest  may arise,  for
                  example,  when a proxy is voted for a company that is a client
                  of one of the Advisers,  such as GAMCO Asset Management Inc. A
                  conflict  also may arise when a client of one of the  Advisers
                  has made a shareholder proposal in a proxy to be voted upon by
                  one or more of the  Advisers.  The  Director  of Proxy  Voting
                  Services,  together with the Legal Department, will scrutinize
                  all proxies for these or other  situations  that may give rise
                  to a  conflict  of  interest  with  respect  to the  voting of
                  proxies.

A.                OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE.

                  For matters  submitted  to the  Committee,  each member of the
                  Committee  will receive,  prior to the meeting,  a copy of the
                  proxy statement,  any relevant third party research, a summary
                  of any views provided by the Chief Investment  Officer and any
                  recommendations by Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts. The Chief
                  Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts may
                  be invited to present  their  viewpoints.  IF THE  DIRECTOR OF
                  PROXY VOTING SERVICES or the Legal Department believe that the
                  matter  before the  committee  is one with  respect to which a
                  conflict of interest may exist  between the Advisers and their
                  clients,  counsel  will  provide an  opinion to the  Committee
                  concerning  the  conflict.  If the  matter is one in which the
                  interests  of the  clients  of one or  more  of  Advisers  may
                  diverge,  counsel  will so advise and the  Committee  may make
                  different  recommendations  as to different  clients.  For any
                  matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
                  counsel  will provide an opinion  concerning  the likely risks
                  and merits of such an appraisal action.

         Each matter  submitted to the Committee  will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of
the Committee  will cast the deciding  vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy  Guidelines  express the normal  preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment  guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.
<PAGE>

         If  the  vote  cast  either  by  the  analyst  or as a  result  of  the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation
of the Board of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine  whether an amendment to the most recently  filed  Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II.      SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III.     CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any  change  in voting  authority,  the  following  should  be  notified  by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

         In the event that the Board of  Directors  (or a Committee  thereof) of
one or more of the  investment  companies  managed  by one of the  Advisers  has
retained  direct voting control over any security,  the Proxy Voting  Department
will provide each Board  Member (or  Committee  member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.      VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting  Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients.  The Advisers' staff may request proxy-voting
records for use in presentations to current or prospective clients. Requests for
proxy voting records should be made at least ten days prior to client meetings.

          If a client  wishes to receive a proxy  voting  record on a quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual  basis,  please notify the Proxy Voting  Department.  The
reports will be available for mailing  approximately  ten days after the quarter
end of the period.  First  quarter  reports may be delayed  since the end of the
quarter falls during the height of the proxy season.

         A letter  is sent to the  custodians  for all  clients  for  which  the
Advisers  have  voting  responsibility  instructing  them to  forward  all proxy
materials to:
<PAGE>

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.       VOTING PROCEDURES

1.  Custodian  banks,  outside  brokerage  firms and Wexford  Clearing  Services
Corporation are responsible for forwarding proxies directly to GAMCO.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms (VAFs) - Issued by ADP. VAFs must be
     voted through the issuing institution causing a time lag. ADP is an outside
     service contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.

o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In the case of a  discrepancy  such as  an  incorrect  number of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions  from the proxy committee (see  Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Since  January 1, 1992,  records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.
The  system  is backed  up  regularly.  From 1990  through  1991,  records  were
maintained  on the PROXY  VOTER  system and in hardcopy  format.  Prior to 1990,
records were maintained on diskette and in hardcopy format.

PROXY EDGE records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue
         The rationale for the vote when it appropriate
<PAGE>

Records prior to the institution of the PROXY EDGE system include:
         Security name
         Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Date of Meeting
         Name of Custodian
         Name of Client
         Custodian Account Number
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' recommendation
         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue
         Date the proxy statement was received and by whom
         Name of person posting the vote
         Date and method by which the vote was cast

o    From these records individual client proxy voting records are compiled.  It
     is our policy to provide  institutional  clients with a proxy voting record
     during client reviews. In addition, we will supply a proxy voting record at
     the request of the client on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by ADP are always sent directly
to a specific individual at ADP.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to ADP up until the time of the meeting. This is followed
     up by mailing the original form.

o    When a  solicitor  has been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o    Banks and brokerage firms using the services at ADP:

     The back of  the VAF is stamped  indicating that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent  overnight to ADP. ADP issues  individual  legal proxies
and sends them back via overnight (or the Adviser can pay messenger charges).  A
lead-time  of at least  two  weeks  prior to the  meeting  is needed to do this.
Alternatively,  the  procedures  detailed  below  for banks not using ADP may be
implemented.

o    Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

     The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:
<PAGE>

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A  limited   Power  of  Attorney   appointing   the   attendee  an  Adviser
     representative.

o    A list of all  shares  being  voted by  custodian  only.  Client  names and
     account numbers are not included.  This list must be presented,  along with
     the  proxies,  to the  Inspectors  of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least
     one-half  hour prior to the scheduled  start of the meeting.  The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e.  determine if the vote have  previously been
     cast,  if the votes have been  rescinded,  etc. vote have  previously  been
     cast, etc.).

o    A  sample  ERISA  and  Individual  contract.

o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.

o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

                  ===========================================

                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

                  ===========================================
<PAGE>


                            GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our  clients.  As we  state  in  our  Magna  Carta  of  Shareholders  Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither for nor against  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Historical responsiveness to shareholders
           This may include such areas as:
           -Paying greenmail
           -Failure to adopt shareholder resolutions receiving a majority of
            shareholder votes
o        Qualifications
o        Nominating committee in place
o        Number of outside directors on the board
o        Attendance at meetings
o        Overall performance

                              SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for audit

                           BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.

                                CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.
<PAGE>

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place we will generally not support  attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.

                        INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Future use of additional shares
           -Stock split
           -Stock option or other executive  compensation  plan
           -Finance growth of company/strengthen  balance sheet
           -Aid in restructuring
           -Improve credit rating
           -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o        Amount of stock currently authorized but not yet issued or reserved for
         stock option plans
o        Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.

                               CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.
<PAGE>

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.

                     DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.

                            EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.

                              FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                                GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by- case basis.

Note:  Congress has imposed a tax on any parachute that is more than three times
the executive's average annual compensation.

                            ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.
<PAGE>

                CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                   MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.

                                 MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.

                                NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

                       OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o        State of Incorporation
o        Management history of responsiveness to shareholders

                                   POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.

                                 REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.

                               STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o        Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o        Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o        Method of payment
o        Amount of stock already authorized but not yet issued under existing
         stock option plans

                         SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

As reflected  above,  the Portfolio  Managers manage accounts in addition to the
Trust.  Actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest  may arise when a Portfolio
Manager also has day-to-day  management  responsibilities with respect to one or
more other accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION  OF LIMITED TIME AND  ATTENTION.  As indicated  above,  the Portfolio
Managers manage multiple accounts.  As a result, they will not be able to devote
all of their time to management of the Trust. The Portfolio Manager,  therefore,
may not be able  to  formulate  as  complete  a  strategy  or  identify  equally
attractive  investment  opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the
case if he were to devote all of his  attention  to the  management  of only the
Trust.

ALLOCATION  OF  LIMITED  INVESTMENT  OPPORTUNITIES.   As  indicated  above,  the
Portfolio  Managers manage managed  accounts with investment  strategies  and/or
policies  that are similar to the Trust.  In these cases,  if he  identifies  an
investment  opportunity that may be suitable for multiple  accounts,  a Fund may
not be able to take full advantage of that  opportunity  because the opportunity
may be allocated  among all or many of these accounts or other accounts  managed
primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser,  and their affiliates.  In
addition,  in the event the Portfolio Manager  determines to purchase a security
for more than one account in an aggregate  amount that may  influence the market
price of the security,  accounts that  purchased or sold the security  first may
receive a more favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions.
<PAGE>

SELECTION  OF  BROKER/DEALERS.  Because  of  Mr.  Gabelli's  position  with  the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor,  he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute  portfolio  transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING  STRATEGIES.  At times, the Portfolio Manager may determine
that an investment  opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the accounts
for which he exercises investment responsibility,  or may decide that certain of
the  funds or  accounts  should  take  differing  positions  with  respect  to a
particular  security.  In these  cases,  he may  execute  differing  or opposite
transactions  for one or more accounts  which may affect the market price of the
security or the execution of the  transaction,  or both, to the detriment of one
or more other accounts.

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION.  A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other benefits  available to the Portfolio Managers differ among the accounts
that they  manage.  If the  structure  of the  Adviser's  management  fee or the
Portfolio Manager's  compensation  differs among accounts (such as where certain
accounts pay higher management fees or  performance-based  management fees), the
Portfolio  Manager may be motivated to favor certain  accounts over others.  The
Portfolio  Manager also may be  motivated  to favor  accounts in which he has an
investment  interest,  or  in  which  the  Adviser,  or  their  affiliates  have
investment interests.  Similarly, the desire to maintain assets under management
or to  enhance a  Portfolio  Manager's  performance  record  or to derive  other
rewards,  financial or  otherwise,  could  influence  the  Portfolio  Manager in
affording preferential treatment to those accounts that could most significantly
benefit the Portfolio Manager. For example, as reflected above, if the Portfolio
Manager  manages  accounts  which have  performance  fee  arrangements,  certain
portions of his  compensation  will  depend on the  achievement  of  performance
milestones on those accounts.  The Portfolio Manager could be incented to afford
preferential  treatment to those  accounts and thereby by subject to a potential
conflict of interest.

The Adviser,  and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser  and their  staff  members.  However,  there is no  guarantee  that such
policies and  procedures  will be able to detect and prevent every  situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR MARIO J. GABELLI

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined  by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees the  firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's  compensation)  allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have  arrangements  whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee  attributable  to the  liquidation  value of outstanding  preferred
stock (and Mr.  Gabelli would only receive his  percentage of such advisory fee)
if  certain  performance  levels  are met.  Additionally,  he  receives  similar
incentive  based variable  compensation  for managing other accounts  within the
firm and its  affiliates.  This method of  compensation  is based on the premise
that superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher  compensation  as a result of growth of assets through  appreciation
and net investment  activity.  The level of  compensation is not determined with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  One of the other  registered  investment  companies  managed  by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance  (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his  compensation
is  adjusted  up or down  based on the  performance  of the  investment  company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance  fees.
Compensation  for managing these accounts has two  components.  One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account.  The second component is based on absolute  performance of the account,
with  respect  to  which a  percentage  of such  performance  fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli.  As an executive  officer of the  Adviser's  parent  company,  GBL, Mr.
Gabelli  also  receives ten percent of the net  operating  profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR CAESAR M. P. BRYAN

The  compensation of Mr. Bryan for the Trust is structured to enable the Adviser
to  attract  and  retain  highly   qualified   professionals  in  a  competitive
environment. The Portfolio Manager receives a compensation package that includes
a minimum draw or base salary, equity-based incentive compensation via awards of
stock options,  and incentive based variable  compensation based on a percentage
of net revenue received by the Adviser for managing the Trust to the extent that
the amount exceeds a minimum level of compensation.  Net revenues are determined
by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees  certain  of the firm's
expenses  (other than the  Portfolio  Managers'  compensation)  allocable to the
Trust (the incentive-based  variable compensation for managing other accounts is
also  based on a  percentage  of net  revenues  to the  investment  adviser  for
managing the account).  This method of compensation is based on the premise that
superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded with
higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation and net
investment  activity.  The level of equity-based  incentive and  incentive-based
variable compensation is based on an evaluation by the Adviser's parent, GBL, of
quantitative and qualitative  performance  evaluation criteria.  This evaluation
takes into account, in a broad sense, the performance of the accounts managed by
the Portfolio  Manager,  but the level of  compensation  is not determined  with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  Generally,  greater  consideration  is given to the  performance  of
larger  accounts  and to longer  term  performance  over  smaller  accounts  and
short-term performance.

                                                                  EX-99.CODE ETH

                  GABELLI ASSET MANAGEMENT INC. AND AFFILIATES


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE GABELLI FUNDS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each  investment  company  listed on Exhibit 1 hereto  (each a
"COMPANY") is committed to conducting  business in  accordance  with  applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate  disclosure -- financial  and otherwise -- in compliance  with
applicable  law.  This  Code  of  Ethics,  applicable  to each  Company's  Chief
Executive Officer,  President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (together, "SENIOR OFFICERS"), sets forth policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

                  As a Senior Officer,  you must comply with applicable law. You
also have a responsibility  to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner.
You have  leadership  responsibilities  that include  creating a culture of high
ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that  encourages  the  internal  reporting of  compliance  concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics  recognizes  that the Senior  Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies,  because the Senior Officers  currently or may in the future serve as
Senior  Officers  of each of the  Companies,  as officers  or  employees  of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "Advisor")
and/or  affiliates  of the  Advisor  (the  "Advisory  Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors  of other  registered  investment  companies and unregistered
investment  funds  advised  by the  Advisory  Group.  This Code of  Ethics  also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and  procedures  adopted by, the  Companies  or the  Advisory  Group govern your
conduct in  connection  with many of the  conflict of interest  situations  that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

          o       the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulation   promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 ACT");

          o       the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "ADVISERS ACT");

          o       the Code of Ethics  adopted by each  Company  pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act  (collectively,  the "TRUST'S 1940
                  ACT CODE OF ETHICS");
<PAGE>

          o       one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been  reviewed and  approved by those  trustees/directors
                  (the  "DIRECTORS")  of each Company  that are not  "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the  "ADVISORY  GROUP'S  1940 ACT
                  CODE OF ETHICS" and,  together  with such  Company's  1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 ACT CODES OF ETHICS");

          o       the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3,   Rule  17a-7  and  Rule  17e-1   under  the  1940  Act
                  (collectively, the "CONFLICT POLICIES"); and

          o       the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other  things,  conflict  of interest  situations  and related
                  matters (collectively, the "ADVISORY POLICIES").

The  provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the  Conflict  Policies  and  the  Advisory  Policies  are  referred  to  herein
collectively as the "ADDITIONAL CONFLICT RULES".

                  This Code of Ethics is  different  from,  and is  intended  to
supplement,  the  Additional  Conflict  Rules.  Accordingly,  a violation of the
Additional  Conflict  Rules by a Senior  Officer  is hereby  deemed  not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional  Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior  Officer has a  responsibility  to each Company to
act with integrity.  Integrity  requires,  among other things,  being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

          o       act with  integrity,  including  being honest and candid while
                  still  maintaining the  confidentiality  of information  where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

          o       comply with the laws,  rules and  regulations  that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's  operations and report any suspected
                  violations  thereof  in  accordance  with  the  section  below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

          o       adhere to a high standard of business ethics.
<PAGE>
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest  for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs  when your  private  interests  interfere  in any way,  or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior  Officers  are expected to use  objective  and unbiased
standards when making  decisions that affect each Company,  keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain  inherent  conflicts of interest  because
Senior  Officers of a Company  also are or may be  officers  of other  Companies
and/or the Advisory  Group (as a result of which it is incumbent  upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner,  including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business  relationships.  When making
any  investment,  accepting  any  position  or  benefits,  participating  in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest  with respect to each Company  where
you are  receiving a personal  benefit,  you should act in  accordance  with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior  Officer  of a Company,  you should  make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and  circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the  Advisory  Group (the  "CCO") and obtain the  approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some  conflict of interest  situations  that should  always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

          o       the receipt of any  entertainment  or non-nominal  gift by the
                  Senior  Officer,  or a member of his or her  family,  from any
                  company  with  which a  Company  has  current  or  prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate  as to time and place,  and not so  frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

          o       any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

          o       a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other  than an  interest  arising  from the  Senior  Officer's
                  employment  by the Advisory  Group,  such as  compensation  or
                  equity ownership.
<PAGE>

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable  disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations  in all reports  and  documents  that such  Company  files with,  or
submits to, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  or a national  securities
exchange  and in all other  public  communications  made by such  Company.  As a
Senior Officer,  you are required to promote  compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company 's standards,  policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

          o       familiarize   himself   or   herself   with   the   disclosure
                  requirements  applicable  to  each  Company  as  well  as  the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

          o       not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent  auditors,  such Company's counsel,
                  any  counsel  to  the  Independent   Directors,   governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a  violation  of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations,  policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must  report  that  information  on a  timely  basis  to the  CCO or  report  it
anonymously by following the "whistle  blower"  policies adopted by the Advisory
Group from time to time. NO ONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION BECAUSE OF A GOOD
FAITH REPORT OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION.

                  Each Company will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

          o       the CCO will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
                  actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

          o       violations  and potential  violations  will be reported to the
                  Board  of  Directors  of  each  affected  Company  after  such
                  investigation;

          o       if the Board of  Directors  determines  that a  violation  has
                  occurred,  it  will  take  all  appropriate   disciplinary  or
                  preventive action; and

          o       appropriate  disciplinary  or preventive  action may include a
                  letter of censure,  suspension,  dismissal or, in the event of
                  criminal or other serious  violations of law,  notification of
                  the  Securities and Exchange  Commission or other  appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities.
<PAGE>

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

                  Except as otherwise  provided in this Code of Ethics,  the CCO
is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics to specific  situations in which
questions are presented to the CCO and has the authority to interpret  this Code
of Ethics in any particular  situation.  The CCO shall take all action he or she
considers appropriate to investigate any actual or potential violations reported

                  The CCO is authorized  to consult,  as  appropriate,  with the

Advisory Group or the Independent Directors, and is encouraged to do so.

                  The Board of Directors of the affected  Company is responsible
for granting waivers of this Code of Ethics,  as appropriate.  Any changes to or
waivers of this Code of Ethics  will,  to the extent  required,  be disclosed on
Form N-CSR,  or  otherwise,  as provided by Securities  and Exchange  Commission

less  than six (6) years  from the date an  action  is taken,  the first two (2)
years in an easily  accessible  place,  a copy of the  information  or materials
supplied to the Boards of Directors pursuant to this Code of Ethics:

          o       that  provided  the basis for any  amendment or waiver to this
                  Code of Ethics; and

          o       relating to any violation of this Code of Ethics and sanctions
                  imposed for such violation,  together with a written record of
                  the  approval  or  action  taken  by  the  relevant  Board  of
                  Directors.

Ethics, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent

         CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE 30A-2(A) UNDER THE 1940 ACT AND
                     SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT



I, Bruce N. Alpert, certify that:

1.       I have reviewed  this report on Form N-CSR of The Gabelli  Equity Trust
         Inc.;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         assets,  and cash flows (if the  financial  statements  are required to
         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) and
         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and
<PAGE>

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
