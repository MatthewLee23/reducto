MuniVest Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net
asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments,
net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the
form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the
per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to
benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped;
that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At the same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common Stock shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks
of leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. As of February 29, 2004, the percentage of the
Fund's total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 13.92%, before the
deduction of Preferred Stock.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may also invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter
contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the
change in market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return
for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change
in market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or
taking physical custody of securities.

A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

As I write to you at February month-end, fixed income markets in the United
States continued to reward those investors willing to accept greater risk. The
trend held true in the tax-exempt market, where the Lehman Brothers
Non-Investment Grade Index of municipal bonds posted respective returns of
+10.96% and +16.15% for the six-month and 12-month periods ended February 29,
2004. This compared to a six-month return of +6.52% and a 12-month return of
+6.30% for the broader-based Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index.

At the same time, equity markets maintained their positive momentum from
year-end 2003. For the six-month and 12-month periods ended February 29, 2004,
the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index returned +14.59% and +38.52%,
respectively. Much of the boost came from improving economic conditions in the
United States.

The major signposts indicate that we are seeing a shift from economic growth
fueled primarily by fiscal and monetary stimulus to a broader-based,
self-sustaining economic expansion. Gross domestic product growth, which peaked
at an annualized rate of 8.2% in the third quarter of 2003, was 4.1% in the
fourth quarter. A similar level of growth is expected in the first quarter of
2004. For its part, the Federal Reserve Board has reiterated its willingness to
keep short-term interest rates at current low levels to ensure the economy's
strength.

Accompanying the increase in economic activity was an improvement in corporate
earnings. By February 10, 2004, 392 of the S&P 500 companies had reported their
fourth-quarter 2003 results, and 67.6% of those exceeded expectations. In the
meantime, the American consumer, who continued to spend despite the faltering
economy, may get further incentive from another round of Federal tax refunds
this year.

At Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, we believe the events and efforts of 2003
leave us with a much stronger economy and that recent optimism suggests it is
time for investors to consider what can go right in 2004. We encourage you to
revisit your portfolio and your asset allocation strategy to ensure you are well
positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment
assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years ahead.

                                                Sincerely,


                                                /s/ Terry K. Glenn

                                                Terry K. Glenn
                                                President and Director

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      An emphasis on higher-yielding issues allowed us to enhance the Fund's
income stream and, ultimately, increase the dividend paid to shareholders.

Discuss the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Over the past six months, long-term fixed income interest rates generally
declined while the U.S. economy gained strength. Gross domestic product expanded
at an annualized rate of 8.2% in the third quarter of 2003, with fourth-quarter
growth reported at 4.1%. Notwithstanding the impressive economic growth, the
Federal Reserve Board seemed apt to leave short-term interest rates at their
current low levels, citing subdued employment growth and the absence of material
inflationary pressures.

At the end of February 2004, long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields stood at 4.84%,
representing a decline of nearly 40 basis points (.40%) over the past six
months. Tax-exempt municipal bond yields also moved sharply lower during the
period, while their prices -- which move opposite of their yields -- rose
accordingly. Yields on long-term revenue bonds, as measured by the Bond Buyer
Revenue Bond Index, fell almost 60 basis points. The same was true of 30-year
issues rated AAA -- the highest rated -- according to Municipal Market Data.
Shorter-maturity bonds fared even better, as yields on 10-year AAA-rated bonds
declined approximately 65 basis points during the period.

Supporting the recent yield declines was a pronounced decrease in new bond
issuance. This translated into favorable supply/demand dynamics in the municipal
marketplace. Approximately $170 billion in municipal bonds was underwritten
during the past six months, a drop of approximately 10% compared to the same
period a year earlier. In February, just $22 billion in new long-term municipal
bonds was underwritten, a decline of more than 25% versus February 2003. New
supply of municipal bonds is expected to remain manageable in 2004, a trend we
believe will continue to support the tax-exempt market's performance relative to
the taxable bond market.

While investor enthusiasm for stocks has taken some attention away from fixed
income markets, overall demand for tax-exempt municipal bonds has remained
positive. Municipal yields have recently ranged from 88% to 91% of Treasury
yields, slightly higher than their recent historical average. Moreover,
municipal investors generally preferred longer-dated securities, which offered
somewhat higher yields in the low interest rate environment. This maturity
extension helped support the strong demand for and performance of tax-exempt
products in recent months.

How did the Fund perform during the period in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the six-month period ended February 29, 2004, the Common Stock of MuniVest
Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 6.35% and 6.68%, based on a period-end
per share net asset value of $10.23 and a per share market price of $9.73,
respectively, and $.324 per share income dividends. Over the same period, the
total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +10.99%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $9.54 to $10.23, and assuming
reinvestment of $.321 per share ordinary income dividends.

For the six-month period ended February 29, 2004, the Fund's Auction Market
Preferred Stock (AMPS) had average yields as follows: Series A, .86%; Series B,
..96%; Series C, .92%; Series D, .81%; and Series E, .86%.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, for the period was closely
aligned with the +10.93% average return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt
Funds (Leveraged) category for the six months ended February 29, 2004. As
interest rates moved lower over the past six months, we established a more
defensive portfolio position. This involved limiting the Fund's vulnerability to
future interest rate movements, and was largely accomplished by replacing some
of the Fund's more interest rate-sensitive issues with larger-coupon,
higher-yielding bonds. The incremental income generated by these higher-yielding
issues generally offsets the market appreciation produced by more interest
rate-sensitive bonds. This strategy allowed the Fund's total return to keep pace
with recent market moves while also enhancing its income stream.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section
included in this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As
a result, total investment returns based on changes in the Fund's market value
of the Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment return
based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

The decline in new municipal bond issuance in recent months has resulted in
restricted portfolio activity. In addition to a dwindling supply of new issues,
we also have seen limited trading opportunities in the secondary market. This is
because institutional investors have been increasingly reluctant to sell
existing higher-coupon holdings and reinvest the proceeds at current low market
rates.

Our strategy has been to add lower-rated investment grade issues to the
portfolio whenever they have been attractively priced. These issues generate
incremental coupon income, which has served to enhance the Fund's total return.
By adding these lower-rated securities, we also have enjoyed a cumulative
positive effect on the Fund's income stream, which allowed the Fund's dividend
to be increased in February 2004. This increase placed the Fund's dividend well
above that of many of its peers.

In terms of leverage, the Fund's borrowing costs remained in a .85% - 1.0% range
during the period. These attractive funding levels, in combination with a steep
tax-exempt yield curve, generated a significant income benefit to the Fund's
Common Stock shareholders. Further declines in the Fund's borrowing costs would
require significant easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board.
While such action is not expected, neither is an imminent increase in short-term
interest rates. We expect short-term borrowing costs to remain near current
attractive levels for the coming months. However, should the spread between
short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of leverage will
decline, and as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. At the
end of the period, the Fund's leverage amount, based on AMPS, was 30.47% of
total assets. (For a more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of
leveraging, see page 2 of this report to shareholders.)

How would you characterize the portfolio's position at the close of the period?

We ended the period with a slightly defensive position with respect to future
interest rate movements. We continue to favor more defensive, higher-coupon
issues over the more interest rate-sensitive securities. At the close of the
period, the Fund had modest cash reserves of approximately 2%. Overall, the Fund
is structured to perform better in stable-to-rising interest rate environments.
If yields decline to the recent lows seen in June 2003, we would expect to adopt
a much stronger defensive strategy.

Looking ahead, we believe moderate economic growth, especially within a context
of negligible inflationary pressures, should not greatly endanger the positive
fixed income environment that tax-exempt products have enjoyed.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
may require the use of management accruals and estimates. These unaudited
financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period
presented. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Fund
determines and makes available for publication the net asset value of its Common
Stock on a weekly basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on the American Stock
Exchange under the symbol MVF. The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter markets and are valued at the last available bid price in the
over-the-counter market or on the basis of yield equivalents as obtained by the
Fund's pricing service from one or more dealers that make markets in the
securities. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on
exchanges, are valued at their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges.
Options written or purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of
exchange-traded options. In the case of options traded in the over-the-counter
market, valuation is the last asked price (options written) or the last bid
price (options purchased). Swap agreements are valued by quoted fair values
received daily by the Fund from the counterparty. Short-term investments with a
remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value. Securities and assets for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or
under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund, including valuations
furnished by a pricing service retained by the Fund, which may utilize a matrix
system for valuations. The procedures of the pricing service and its valuations
are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general supervision of the
Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
      Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund
      is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the
      liability is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current market
      value of the option written.

      When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the
      related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from) the
      basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
      of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
      closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to
      the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent
      the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.

necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary

shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which
comprises part of the financial information included in this report.

MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level of
current income exempt from Federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which is exempt from Federal income taxes in the opinion of bond counsel to
the issuer.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to the
shareholders of MuniVest Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase of
shares of the Fund or any securities mentioned in the report. Past performance
results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. The Fund has leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Statements and other information herein
are as dated and are subject to change.
