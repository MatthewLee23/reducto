CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds for the six months ended April 30, 2007.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Funds' investments,
and their financial statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income
exempt from regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific fund, a high
level of current income exempt from that state's personal income taxes (and, in
the case of the New York Fund, New York City personal income tax).

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds because our experience and
research indicate strongly that this maturity range has historically offered the
best risk/reward profile on the yield curve, providing much of the return of
longer-term bonds--with less volatility and risk.

We believe that our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax exempt current income over
the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS Portfolio Commentaries

During the first two months of the six-month reporting period ended April 30,
2007, municipal bonds performed well, especially during the seasonally strong
last six weeks of the calendar year when supply tends to be limited and prices
generally firm. However, in the first quarter of 2007, new issuance increased
significantly. Although the market absorbed the new supply in an orderly
fashion, municipal securities slightly underperformed taxable counterparts from
January to April.

Narrow credit spreads (the yield differential between higher and lower rated
bonds) narrowed even further in recent months due to strong demand for lower
rated securities. Although our commitment to high credit quality restrained
relative returns during this reporting period, in our opinion, today's
ultra-tight credit spreads would not justify lowering the Funds' average credit
rating. The municipal securities market's yield curve (consisting of yields from
shorter to longer maturities) remains flat. Consequently, there is also little
incentive to extend the Funds' current weighted average maturity or duration.

In terms of sectors, essential service revenue bonds are by far the Funds'
largest commitment and are priced attractively relative to general obligation
bonds. In addition, with a slowing economy, we feel more comfortable owning
essential service revenue bonds, which traditionally have been less vulnerable
to economic downturns and are often structured with secure legal provisions that
further protect bondholders.

In general, credit quality in the municipal securities market remains good.
However, there are some areas of concern, most notably municipal issuers with
large underfunded pension plans and other post-employment benefit expenses.
Fully funding these plans would demand politically unpopular actions such as
raising taxes or cutting other types of benefits, which may contribute to delays
in their resolution. Consequently, the credit quality of these issuers may
continue to deteriorate. However, we believe that our commitment to thorough
in-house credit analysis of all investments helps us to avoid securities that
may be subject to potential credit deterioration.

Going forward, we think that municipal securities will trade in a relatively
narrow range until economic data provide a clearer indication of a shift in
Federal Reserve monetary policy. Currently, mixed economic signals make it even
more difficult for us (and we suspect the Fed as well) to determine whether
further tightening or easing is the right course. On the one hand, anemic first
quarter 2007 Gross Domestic Product growth, a weak housing market that may
decline further due to problems for sub-prime lenders, and higher gasoline and
food prices that are pinching consumers' pocketbooks, would suggest the need for
monetary relief. However, U.S. inflation remains above the Fed's comfort zone
and tight U.S. labor markets, rising commodities costs, increased inflationary
pressure overseas and the tumbling dollar may make easing less likely. We think
it may be quite a while before economic data provide a clear indication of what
the Fed may do next. Until then, we will probably maintain the Funds' current
weighted average maturities and durations.

In closing, municipal securities continue, in our view, to be priced
attractively relative to Treasury securities. With intermediate maturity
municipal bond yields on average about 82% of the 10-year Treasury bond yield,
municipals provide a significant yield advantage for investors in the 35% income
tax bracket.*

CALIFORNIA INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL FUND

For the six-month period, on a net asset value (NAV) basis, California
Intermediate Municipal Fund provided a positive return, trailing the results for
the Lehman Brothers 10-Year Municipal Bond Index and the Lipper Intermediate
Municipal Debt Funds Index.

*    The U.S. Supreme Court has announced that it will consider a case from
     Kentucky involving the question of whether a state can give a tax deduction
     to holders of its bonds without giving a similar deduction to holders of
     other states' bonds. Although it is far too early to predict how the court
     might decide this case, we will watch it carefully as it has the potential
     to affect single-state funds.

assets. At the close of the reporting period, the Fund's duration was 4.7 years
and the portfolio's leverage position was 37.0% of assets.

NEW YORK INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL FUND

For the six months ended April 30, 2007, on a NAV basis, the New York
Intermediate Municipal Fund generated a positive return, outpacing both the
Lehman Brothers 10-Year Municipal Bond Index and the Lipper Intermediate
Municipal Debt Funds Index.

As of April 30, 2007, the portfolio included 94.1% revenue bonds, 4.6% general
obligation bonds, and 1.3% short-term investments. Bonds subject to the
Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) equaled 20.5% of assets. At the close of the

position was 37.3% of assets.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in securities by Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal
     Fund Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", and collectively,
     the "Funds") are valued daily by obtaining bid price quotations from
     independent pricing services on all securities available in each service's
     data base. For all other securities, bid prices are obtained from principal
     market makers in those securities or, if quotations are not readily
     available, by methods each Fund's Board of Directors has approved on the
     belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may be considered
     when determining the fair value of a security, including available analyst,
     media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer
     of the security being fair valued has other securities outstanding.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.
##   At April 30, 2007, selected Fund information on a U.S. federal income tax
     basis was as follows:

     NEW YORK            125,004       2,951           248            2,703

@    At time of investment, municipal securities purchased by the Funds are
     within the four highest rating categories (with respect to at least 80% of
     total assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating
     organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
     Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where not rated, are
     determined by the Funds' investment manager to be of comparable quality.
     Approximately 80%, 70%, and 60% of the municipal securities held by
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, have credit
     enhancement features backing them, which the Funds may rely on, such as
     letters of credit, insurance, or guarantees. Without these credit
     enhancement features the securities may or may not meet the quality
     standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported by securities in
     escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, or
     instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay the periodic
     interest due and the principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give the Funds
     the right to sell back the issue on the date specified.
(3)  Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.
(1)  Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A
     and have been deemed by the investment manager to be liquid. At April 30,
     2007, these securities amounted to $502,000 or 0.5% of net assets
     applicable to common shareholders for California, $5,460,000 or 1.8% of net
     assets applicable to common shareholders for Intermediate and $502,000 or
     0.6% of net assets applicable to common shareholders for New York.
^^   Not rated by a NRSRO.
(4)  All or a portion of this security was purchased on a when-issued basis. At
     April 30, 2007, these securities amounted to $1,044,000 or 0.3% of net
     assets applicable to common shareholders for Intermediate.
(5)  All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for
     when-issued purchase commitments.
(6)  Floating rate securities are securities whose yields vary with a designated
     market index or market rate. These securities are shown at their current
     rates as of April 30, 2007.
+/-  Rated BBB by Fitch Investor Services, Inc.

     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on trade date for financial reporting purposes. Interest income,
     including accretion of discount (adjusted for original issue discount,
     where applicable) and amortization of premium, where applicable, is
     recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from securities
     transactions are recorded on the basis of identified cost and stated in the
     Statements of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: Each Fund is treated as a separate entity for U.S.
     federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to continue to
     qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
     requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
     regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
     earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax
     provision is required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by each Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by each Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2006, there were no permanent differences
     resulting from different book and tax accounting reclassified at fiscal
     year-end.

     As of October 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings

     The differences between book basis and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments.

     To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be offset
     by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not to
     distribute such gains. As determined at October 31, 2006, the Funds had
     unused capital loss carryforwards available for federal income tax purposes
     to offset net realized capital gains, if any, as follows:

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to declare
     quarterly and pay monthly distributions. Distributions from net realized
     capital gains, if any, are normally distributed in December. Distributions
     to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions to
     preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     Subsequent to April 30, 2007, each Fund declared three monthly
     distributions to common shareholders payable June 15, 2007, July 16, 2007
     and August 15, 2007 to shareholders of record on May 31, 2007, June 29,
     2007 and July 31, 2007, with ex-dates of May 29, 2007, June 27, 2007 and

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund. Expenses
     borne by the complex of related investment companies, which includes
     open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management serves as
     investment manager, that are not directly attributed to a Fund are
     allocated among the Funds and the other investment companies in the complex
     or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where a more
     appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

     All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000
     per share plus any accumulated unpaid distributions, whether or not earned
     or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation
     Value"). Distributions to AMPS shareholders, which are cumulative, are
     accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay distributions every 7
     days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28 days for each Fund's AMPS
     Series B, unless in a special rate period.

     In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset every
     7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an auction.

</Table>

     The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part, on
     the second business day preceding any distribution payment date at
     Liquidation Value.

     The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
     Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
     declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
     shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation
     Value.

     The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common shares as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or a Fund's
     charter. The holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a separate class, are
     entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a
     majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund fails to pay distributions
     on AMPS for two consecutive years.

8    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
     held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
     developments, including those particular to a specific industry or region.
     California and New York normally invest substantially all of their assets
     in municipal bonds of issuers located in the state of California and the
     state of New York, respectively. The value of the Funds' securities are
     more susceptible to adverse economic, political, regulatory or other
     factors affecting the issuers of such municipal bonds than a fund that does
     not limit its investments to such issuers.

9    INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Funds' organizational
     documents provide that their officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Funds. In addition, both in some of their principal service contracts and
     in the normal course of their business, the Funds enter into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against each Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.30% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the
     New York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to each Fund, are wholly-owned
     subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly-owned holding
     company. Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with investment
     recommendations and research information without added cost to each Fund.
     Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of each Fund are also
     employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

     Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
     custodian contract. For the six months ended April 30, 2007, the impact of
     this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $1,055, $1,270, and $1,260
     for California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, each Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that each
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require each Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. Each Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report which is reflected in the
     Statements of Operations under the caption "Basic maintenance expense."

     NOTE E--RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

     On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
     released FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
     Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions
     should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
     statements. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by
     prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to
     meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
     that a "more-likely-than-not" threshold be met before the benefit of a tax
     position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how
     such benefit should be measured. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal
     years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
     tax years as of the effective date. The Securities and Exchange Commission
     has permitted investment companies to delay implementation of FIN 48. Each
     Fund will have until April 30, 2008 to implement FIN 48. At this time,
     Management is evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and its impact in the
     financial statements has not yet been determined.

     In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value
     Measurement" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a
     framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about


                                       35

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds cont'd

     fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
     after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
     Management believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material
     impact on the Funds' financial positions or results of operations.

     NOTE F--UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

     The financial information included in this interim report is taken from the
     records of each Fund without audit by an independent registered public
     accounting firm. Annual reports contain audited financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under each Fund's distribution reinvestment plan. Results
     represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current
     returns may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment
     returns may fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than
     original cost. For each Fund, total return would have been lower if
     Management had not waived the investment management fee.
#    The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.
~    After waiver of investment management fee by Management. Had Management not
     undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net expenses to average
     daily net assets applicable to common shareholders would have been:

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the
Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current
Shares are registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as
of the first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the payment date, to apply the
amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares (less their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend or distribution except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day
during the purchase period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than
the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent
will not make any further open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of such dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases
during the purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to
the uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue
new Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the
purchase period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net
asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus
estimated brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the
terms specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the reinvestment purchase comparison under the Plan, (a)
the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last sales
price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are principally
traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or if not so
listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean between the
closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on such date
and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be the net
asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund. All
dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or Shares)
shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN cont'd

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
Participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.
