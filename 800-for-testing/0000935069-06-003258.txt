- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited
liability  company on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware  and
is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),  as a
closed-end,   non-diversified,   management   investment  company.   The  Fund's
investment  objective is to generate  consistent  capital  appreciation over the
long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional
equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective
by allocating its assets  primarily  among  professionally  selected  investment
funds  ("Investment   Funds")  that  are  managed  by  experienced   third-party
investment  advisers  ("Portfolio  Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a
corporation  formed  under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ("J.P. Morgan Chase"), is responsible for the allocation
of assets to various Investment Funds,  subject to policies adopted by the Board
of Directors (the "Board").  Ehrlich  Associates,  L.L.C.,  a limited  liability
company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing  Member"),
serves as the managing  member of the Fund. The Managing Member is registered as
a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York and an
affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the special  member of the Fund (the
"Special  Member").  The Special  Member is  entitled  to all  performance-based
incentive allocations, if any from Members' accounts.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.  USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the United  States of America  requires  the  Investment
Manager to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
the financial  statements and  accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
Investment  Manager as of the last business day of each month in accordance with
the valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to
time pursuant to policies  established by the Board.  The Fund's  investments in
the  Investment  Funds are  considered  to be illiquid  and can only be redeemed
periodically.  The  Board has  approved  procedures  pursuant  to which the Fund
values its  investments in Investment  Funds at fair value.  In accordance  with
these  procedures,  fair  value as of each  month-end  ordinarily  is the  value
determined as of such month-end for each  Investment Fund in accordance with the
Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies  and  reported at the time of the Fund's
valuation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
represents the amount that the Fund could  reasonably  expect to receive from an
Investment  Fund  if the  Fund's  interest  were  redeemed  at the  time  of the
valuation,  based on information  reasonably available at the time the valuation
is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the unlikely event that an
Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,
the Fund would  determine  the fair value of such  Investment  Fund based on the
most recent value  reported by the  Investment  Fund, as well any other relevant
information  available  at the time the Fund  values its  portfolio.  The values
assigned to these  investments  are based on  available  information  and do not
necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as such amounts
depend on future  circumstances  and cannot  reasonably be determined  until the
individual investments are actually liquidated. However, because of the inherent
uncertainty of valuation,  those estimated values may differ  significantly from
the  values  that would  have been used had a ready  market for the  investments
existed, and the differences could be significant.

C.  DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied
as a reduction of the  investment's  cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital.  Once the  investment's  cost is  received,  any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D.  INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on
the   ex-dividend   date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  Investment  Fund
transactions  are  calculated  on the  identified  cost basis.  Investments  are
recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the Investment Fund.

E.  FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business  other than those that the
Investment  Manager  assumes.  The  expenses  of the Fund  include,  but are not
limited  to,  the  following:  all  costs and  expenses  related  to  investment
transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and
auditing fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F.  INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a  partnership  for
Federal  income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for the  payment of
Federal,  state  or local  income  taxes  has  been  provided.  Each  Member  is
individually  required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

G.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.
48,  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an  Interpretation  of FASB
Statement No. 109" (the  "Interpretation").  The Interpretation  establishes for
all  entities,  including  pass-through  entities  such as the  Fund,  a minimum
threshold for financial statement  recognition of the benefit of positions taken
in filing tax returns  (including  whether an entity is taxable in a  particular
jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. The Interpretation
is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2006, and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the date of  effectiveness.  Management  has
recently begun to evaluate the  application of the  Interpretation  to the Fund,
and is not in a  position  at this  time to  estimate  the  significance  of its
impact, if any, on the Fund's financial statements.

H.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies on deposit at PNC Bank, N.A.

3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration
for such  management  services,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.1042% (approximately 1.25% on an annualized basis) and
an  additional  administrative  services  fee of 0.0125% per month  (0.15% on an
annualized basis) of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Expense  Limitation  Agreement"),  dated May 26,
2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary,  reimburse  expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the  Agreement  is in place so that the  total  operating  expenses  of the Fund
(excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary  expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive Allocation)
do not exceed  2.30% on an  annualized  basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each  month.  Under the  Expense  Limitation  Agreement,  any  waivers or
reimbursements  made by the  Investment  Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement  is made,  provided that  repayment  does not result in the Fund's
aggregate  operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense  limitations.  For
the six months ended September 30, 2006, the Funds'  operating  expenses did not
exceed  the  expense  limitation.  The Fund  did not  reimburse  the  Investment
Manager,  and the Investment  Manager did not pay for any expenses on the Fund's
behalf.

The Fund has entered into an administration  agreement with PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC"),
whereby PFPC provides fund  accounting,  investor  services and transfer  agency
functions for the Fund. As  compensation  for services set forth herein that are
rendered by PFPC during the term of this Agreement, the Fund pays PFPC an annual

3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

regulatory  administration  services,  and an annual fee for Member  services of
$150 per Member, with a minimum monthly fee of $1,000. PFPC did not waive any of
its fees for the six months ended September 30, 2006. Any previously waived fees
by PFPC are  recoverable  from the Fund if the agreement with PFPC is terminated
within the first three years of the effective date of the agreement.

PFPC Trust Company  ("PFPC  Trust") serves as custodian of the Fund's assets and
provides custodial services to the Fund. As compensation for services,  the Fund
pays PFPC Trust an annual fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average gross assets, with
a minimum monthly fee of $795.

The  Independent  Directors  are each paid an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus
reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in  consideration  for their  attendance  at
meetings of the Board, and any committees  thereof,  and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

4.  LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time,  the Fund may borrow  cash from a major  institution  under a
credit  agreement  up to a maximum  of $5  million.  Interest  is payable on any
outstanding  balance at PRIME plus  Margin  (0%) or LIBOR plus  Margin  (0.85%).
During the six months ended  September 30, 2006,  there were no borrowings,  and
there was no loan payable  outstanding  on September 30, 2006.  Credit  facility
fees paid for the six months ended September 30, 2006 amounted to $4,902.

5.  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate purchases and sales of Investment Funds for the period ended September
30, 2006 amounted to $52,399,008 and $13,537,116 respectively.

6.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscription  for  interests  by  eligible
investors  may be  accepted  at such times as the Fund may  determine.  The Fund
reserves the right to reject any  subscriptions  for interests in the Fund.  The
initial  acceptance  for  subscriptions  for  Interests  was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial  Closing Date,  the Fund generally
accepts subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times, and in such
amounts,  and on such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Board,  in its sole
discretion.  The Investment  Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase  Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September,  and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee payable to the Fund
will be charged for  repurchases of Members'  Interests at any time prior to the
day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a Member's purchase of its
Interests.  For the six  months  ended  September  30,  2006,  the fund  charged
Members' $23,589 in repurchase fees.

6.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

At the end of each Allocation  Period of the Fund, any net capital  appreciation
or net capital  depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized),  as the
case  may  be,  is  allocated  to the  capital  accounts  of all of the  Members
(including  the Special  Member and the Managing  Member) in proportion to their
respective  opening capital account  balances for such  Allocation  Period.  The
initial  "Allocation  Period"  began on the  Initial  Closing  Date,  with  each
subsequent  Allocation  Period  beginning  immediately  after  the  close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the  last  day of each  month,  (2) the  date  immediately  prior  to the
effective  date of (a) the  admission  of a new Member or (b) an  increase  in a
Member's  capital  contribution,  (3) the  effective  date of any  repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar  year,  each Member's  return on investment  for the
year is determined  and a portion of the net capital  appreciation  allocated to
each Member's  capital account during the year (the  "Performance  Allocation"),
net of the  Member's  allocable  share  of the  Management  Fee and the  Manager
Administrative  Services  Fee,  equal to 10% of the  portion of such net capital
appreciation  that  exceeds  the  Preferred  Return (as  defined  below) will be
reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member. The "Preferred Return"
is equal to the 3-month  U.S.  Treasury  Bill yield (as defined  below) for each
month during the relevant  calendar year (or any shorter period of calculation).
The "3-month U.S.  Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal one-twelfth of
the annual yield for the 3-month U.S.  Treasury Bill for the first  business day
of the then current  calendar  quarter as set forth in the U.S.  Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant  maturities",
or if such  measurement  is not  available,  such other  source as the  Managing
Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.

No Performance  Allocation is made, however,  with respect to a Member's capital
account until any cumulative net capital  depreciation  previously  allocated to
such   Member's   capital   account  plus  any   Management   Fees  and  Manager
Administrative   Service  Fees  charged  to  such  capital  account  (the  "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately  to reflect  the  repurchase  of any  portion  of that  Member's
Interest.  Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at the end of a calendar
year) from a Member,  a Performance  Allocation will be determined and allocated
to the Special Member,  and in the case of any repurchase of a partial Interest,
on a "first in - first out" basis  (i.e.,  the  portion  of the  Interest  being
repurchased (and the amount with respect to which the Performance  Allocation is
calculated)   will  be  deemed  to  have  been  taken  from  the  first  capital
contribution  of such Member (as such  contribution  has been  adjusted  for net
capital  appreciation or depreciation,  Management Fees, Manager  Administrative
Services  Fees and other  expenses)  until it is decreased to zero and from each
subsequent  capital  contribution  until  such  contribution  (as  adjusted)  is
decreased to zero).

Based upon profits for the nine months ended  September  30, 2006,  there was no
additional  Performance  Allocation  reallocated to the Special Member.  This is
subject to change as Performance  Allocations  occur at the end of each calendar
year.

7.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance   sheet  risk.   These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,
short-selling activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,
and interest rate,  credit  default and total return 7. equity swaps  contracts.
The  Fund's  risk of loss in these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of
these investments reported by the Fund.

The Fund invests primarily in Investment Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act. The Investment  Funds invest in actively  traded  securities and other
financial  instruments  using  different  strategies and investment  techniques,
including  leverage,  that may  involve  significant  risks.  Although  the Fund
attempts to  diversify  its risk by  investing in  Investment  Funds  managed by
different   third  party   managers,   the  Investment   Funds  may  nonetheless
independently  invest a high  percentage  of their assets in the same or similar
specific  sectors  of the  market  in order to  achieve  a  potentially  greater
investment  return. As a result, the Investment Funds may be more susceptible to
economic,  political,  and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the
market,  positive and negative,  and may experience  increased volatility of the
Investment  Funds' net asset  value.  The Fund  invests  in a limited  number of
Investment Funds. Such  concentration may result in additional risk.  Because of
the  limitation  on rights of  redemption  and the fact that the Fund's  limited
liability  company  interests will not be traded on any  securities  exchange or
other market and will be subject to substantial  restrictions  on transfer,  and
because  of the fact that the Fund may  invest in  Investment  Funds that do not
permit  frequent  withdrawals  and that may invest in  illiquid  securities,  an
investment  in  the  Fund  is  a  highly  illiquid  investment  and  involves  a
substantial  degree of risk.  Illiquid  securities owned by Investment Funds are
riskier than liquid  securities  because the Investment Funds may not be able to
dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates,
or may be able to dispose of the illiquid  securities  only at a greatly reduced
price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Investment Funds may cause investors to
incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund
during or following  periods of negative  performance.  Although the  Investment
Manager and the Managing  Member intend to recommend  that  quarterly  offers be
made to repurchase up to 25% of the Fund's net assets, there can be no assurance
that the Fund will make such offers.

8.  INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of  representations  that provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

9.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Through  October 31, 2006,  the Fund received  subscriptions  from  investors of
$6,160,000 of which $4,990,000 was received in advance of September 30, 2006.

              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our

              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
