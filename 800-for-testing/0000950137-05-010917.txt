NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

The J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index is generally representative of
high-yield securities. The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales
charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be
considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2005

Van Kampen High Income Trust II is managed by the Adviser's High Yield team.(1)
Current team members include Sheila Finnerty, Managing Director of the Adviser,
Gordon Loery, Executive Director of the Adviser and Josh Givelber, Vice
President of the Adviser.

MARKET CONDITIONS

After performing at an extremely brisk clip in 2003 and 2004, the high yield
market generated more muted gains for the six-month period ending June 30, 2005.
Despite good economic growth, strong underlying company fundamentals, reasonable
corporate earnings, low default rates and improving credit qualities, the market
encountered considerable volatility. In January, heavy new issuance created a
less favorable supply-and-demand relationship, and gave investors pause. Of
greater consequence, however, was General Motors' mid-March announcement of
production cuts and poor earnings for the next quarter. The realization that
such a bellwether company was struggling so significantly exacerbated the woes
of the auto industry and cast a grim shadow across the market overall. Moreover,
high yield markets were unsettled by the prospect that General Motors could move
from the high grade to the high yield universe. Such a move, it was feared,
could trigger a sell-off of other high yield bonds, as investors moved to
purchase General Motors debt. Against this backdrop, the market declined through
mid-April.

The reporting period finished on a brighter note, however. The market became
more comfortable with the inclusion of General Motors and Ford Motor in the high
yield arena, while new issuance slowed. Investors returned their attention to
company fundamentals and favorable economic and corporate data.

Overall, the higher rated segment of the high yield universe outperformed issues
rated CCC and lower. From an industry perspective, wireless communications,
telecommunications and food/tobacco generally fared the best, while
transportation, aerospace and forest products tended to lag most significantly.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ, as they did during the reporting period. On an NAV basis,
the trust underperformed its benchmark index, JP Morgan Global High Yield Index.
On a market price basis, the trust underperformed its benchmark. (See table
below.)

AND INDEX DEFINITION.

During the period, the transportation sector declined in response to the
travails of the auto industry and the trust benefited from underweighted
exposure relative to the index benchmark. Moreover, among the transportation
securities the trust did hold, our investment discipline had led us to
de-emphasize auto and auto related companies; this positioning proved
advantageous as these securities were penalized by the market. Security
selection with wireless communications also enhanced performance. The sector
performed well overall, and several of the trust's positions were particularly
rewarded for their strong fundamentals. Consumer product issues contributed
gains, propelled by company-specific results and improvements in fundamentals.

In contrast, positions in forest products, housing and manufacturing securities
slowed the trust's pace. Within housing, exposure to highly leveraged building
product companies hindered performance as investors worried about a potential
decline in home construction. Forest and manufacturing securities detracted from
overall returns due to company-specific reasons.

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

At the close of the reporting period, chemicals, energy, food and gaming/leisure
represented the largest overweightings in the trust relative to the JP Morgan
Global High Yield Index. Technology, telecommunications, utilities, broadcasting
and aerospace were the most significantly underweighted exposures. We note,
however, that the overall sector weightings of the trust are the result of our
conviction in individual securities, not a reflection of a sector-driven
strategy. The overall credit quality of the portfolio was B+ at the close of the
period, slightly higher than that of the benchmark.

There is no guarantee the security sectors mentioned will continue to perform
well or be held by the trust in the future.

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

The Trust recently approved a change in its investment policies to allow the
Trust to enter into interest rate and index swaps and the purchase or sale of
related caps, floors and collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment
or portion of its portfolio, as a duration management technique or to protect
against any increase in the price of securities the Trust anticipates purchasing
at a later date. The Trust intends to use these transactions as hedges and not
as speculative investments and will not sell interest rate caps or floors where
it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the
Trust may be obligated to pay.

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the Trust with another party of
their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g., an exchange of
floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount
of principal. The purchase of an interest rate cap entitles the purchaser, to
the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate, to
receive payments of interest on a contractually-based principal amount from the
party selling the interest rate cap. The purchase of an interest rate floor
entitles the purchaser, to the extent that a specified index falls below a
predetermined interest rate, to receive payments of interest on a
contractually-based principal amount from the party selling the interest rate
floor. An interest rate collar combines the elements of purchasing a cap and
selling a floor. The collar protects against an interest rate rise above the
maximum amount but foregoes the benefit of an interest rate decline below the
minimum amount.

An index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on
changes in the values of the reference indices. The purchase of a cap entitles
the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party
selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined
interest rate or amount. The purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to
receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party

selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a
predetermined interest rate or amount. A collar is a combination of a cap and a
floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest
rates or values.

The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts or credit-linked notes
for hedging purposes or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may
otherwise invest. A credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to
exchange the credit risk of an issuer (reference entity). A buyer of a credit
default swap is said to buy protection by paying periodic fees in return for a
contingent payment from the seller if the reference entity has a credit event
such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding obligations or deteriorating
credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a credit default swap is said
to sell protection and thus collects the periodic fees and profits if the credit
of the reference entity remains stable or improves while the swap is outstanding
but the seller in a credit default swap contract would be required to pay an
agreed-upon amount to the buyer in the event of an adverse credit event of the
reference entity. A credit-linked note is a synthetic security, typically issued
by a special purpose vehicle, that trades like a bond issued by the reference
entity but with the economics of the credit default swap. For this security, the
buyer of protection sells the note. The buyer of protection (note seller) will
pay periodic payments and profit if the reference entity defaults. Unlike the
swap, the buyer of protection in a credit-linked note will receive money at the
time of transaction from the sale of the note, and will return this money at the
contract's maturity if no credit event occurs. Conversely, the seller of
protection purchases the notes. As with a credit default swap, the note
purchaser (protection seller) receives periodic payments. Unlike the swap
transaction, the protection seller must pay for the note at the time of the
transaction and will collect this money at the contract's maturity if no credit
event occurs.

The Trust will enter into swap, cap or floor transactions only with
counterparties approved by the Adviser in accordance with guidelines established
by the Trust's Board of Trustees. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties to the Trust's swap, cap, floor and collar transactions on an
ongoing basis. If there is a default by the other party to such a transaction,
the Trust will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to
the transaction. The Trust may enter into swaps on either an asset-based or
liability-based basis, and will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e.,
the two payment streams are netted out, with the Trust receiving or paying, as
the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the
excess, if any, of the Trust's obligations over its entitlements with respect to
each swap will be accrued on a daily basis and the Trust segregates an amount of
cash and/or liquid securities having an aggregate net asset value at least equal
to the accrued excess. If the Trust enters into a swap transaction on other than
a net basis, the Trust would segregate the full amount accrued on a daily basis
of the Trust's obligations with respect to the swap. To the extent the Trust
sells (i.e. writes) caps, floors and collars, it will segregate cash and/or

                                                                               5
<PAGE>

liquid securities having an aggregate net asset value at least equal to the full
amount, accrued on a daily basis, of the Trust's net obligations with respect to
the caps, floors or collars.

The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves investment
techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio
securities transactions. If the Adviser is incorrect in its forecasts of the
market values, interest rates and other applicable factors, the investment
performance of the Trust would diminish compared with what it would have been if
these investment techniques were not used. The use of swaps, caps, collars and
floors may also have the effect of shifting the recognition of income between
current and future periods.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 25, 2005, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the contract over a
period of several months and the non-management trustees held sessions both with
the investment adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and
considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of factors
control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all factors
together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval

                                                                               9

of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and
its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain matters
considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The trustees also
discuss certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis
by the investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including
certain accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined
that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment
adviser support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, a performance committee of the
Board spends more focused time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in
the Van Kampen complex, paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the performance goals and the
actual results achieved in managing the Fund. When considering a fund's
performance, the trustees and the investment adviser place emphasis on trends
and longer-term returns (focusing on one-year, three-year and five-year
performance with special attention to three-year performance) and, when a fund's
weighted performance is under the fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and
where necessary seek to make specific changes to investment strategy or
investment personnel. The Fund discloses more information about its performance
elsewhere in this report and in the Fund's prospectus. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this Fund relative to
comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and others in the
marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but other fees and
expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others) and the Fund's
overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the performance, fees and
expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the investment advisory
contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of a special ad hoc
committee of the Board. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser its
revenues and expenses, including among other things, revenues for advisory
services, portfolio management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement
costs and allocated expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The

<PAGE>

Board has determined that the analysis of the investment adviser's expenses and
profitability support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and it affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

                                                                              11

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At June 30, 2005, the Trust had $248,585 of when-issued
and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of
debt instruments.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2004, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $26,614,115 which will expire according to the
following table:

    For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $4,000 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer ("CCO") Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Fund. The costs of
these services are allocated to each fund. For the six months ended June 30,
2005, the Fund recognized expenses of approximately $21,500 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as, the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Legal" expenses on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Other" expenses on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments were $23,781,178 and $24,440,052, respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

As of June 30, 2005, the Trust has outstanding 1,112 Auction Preferred Shares
("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is currently reset every
28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on June 30, 2005 was
3.068%. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, the rates ranged from 2.300%
to 3.068%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of Preferred Share Maintenance
expense.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

5. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. All Common Shareholders are deemed to be participants in the Plan unless
they specifically elect not to participate. Common Shareholders who elect not to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions of dividends and capital
gains in cash paid by check mailed directly to the Common Shareholder by the
Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                                                                              29

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    All Common Shareholders of the Trust are deemed to be participants in the
Plan unless they specifically elect not to participate. You may withdraw from
the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by writing State Street Bank
and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any fractional
Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:
