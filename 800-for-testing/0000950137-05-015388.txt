PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based statistical
composite of New York municipal bonds. The index does not include any expenses,
fees or sales charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and
should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in
an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2005

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals is managed by the
Adviser's Municipal Fixed Income team.(1) Current members include Dennis
Pietrzak and John Reynoldson, Executive Directors, and Robert Wimmel, Vice
President of the Adviser.

MARKET CONDITIONS

During the 12-month period ended October 31, 2005, the economy grew at a good
pace, with reasonable gains in employment and sustained strength in consumer
spending. Although oil prices soared, core inflation (which excludes food and
energy) remained relatively benign. Continuing with the course it began in June
of 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee (the Fed) raised the federal funds
target rate eight times during the period. Through a "measured pace" of 25 basis
point increments, the Fed brought the rate to 3.75 percent at the end of the
reporting period. While the yields of short- and intermediate-term bonds moved
upward in concert with the Fed's actions, the yields of long-term bonds ended
the period virtually unchanged. As a result, the yield curve (which charts the
difference between short-term and long-term rates) flattened.

Against this backdrop, total returns across the municipal bond market varied
dramatically, with long maturity bonds outperforming short-term issues by a wide
margin. As investors sought income in an environment of historically low rates,
BBB rated and non-rated bonds significantly outperformed high grade debt, and
credit spreads tightened markedly. Strong and steady flows of new cash into high
yield municipal funds added to the demand for lower rated issues.

Sectors with a preponderance of lower rated credits performed with particular
strength. Tobacco revenue bonds were by far the best performing sector,
supported by overall spread tightening as well as by increasing investor
confidence regarding the extent of tobacco companies' future litigation risk.
Health care bonds (hospitals and long-term care facilities) also fared well,
boosted by strong investor demand.

Municipal bond issuance remained robust in 2005, with $336 billion of debt
brought to market in the first 10 months of the year, a pace on track to beat
the record issuance of 2003. Refunding activity represented a good portion of
this activity, as issuers sought to refinance higher cost debt at lower
prevailing interest rates. Bonds backed by insurance dominated issuance and
increased their market penetration to nearly 60 percent.

The State of New York remained a leading issuer of debt during the period. The
state saw its credit rating improve, due largely to improvements in New York
City's fiscal health. Positive employment data and stable real estate markets
also contributed to a brighter outlook. Economic conditions were not uniformly
strong across the state, however, as the northern "rust belt" area continued to
struggle economically.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On both an NAV and market price basis, the trust outperformed its
benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

Throughout the period, we followed our long-standing practice of trading between
liquid, high quality securities which our analysis identified as compelling
total return opportunities. Our strategy involves buying these bonds when we
believe they are attractively valued, and selling them when they reach our
return targets. We then invest the proceeds into bonds with greater potential
for future total return.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in long-term securities, taking advantage of
the difference between short- and long-term rates. The Fed's policy of raising
interest rates throughout the period made the trust's borrowing activity more
expensive, thereby tempering its benefits.

We sought to position the trust for rising rates, a strategy which proved
beneficial during the period. To limit the trust's exposure to bonds that would
be most vulnerable to rising short-term rates, we sold short and intermediate

                                                                               3

term bonds. Pre-refunded issues also figured prominently among our sales. As
refinancing activity surged, we sold many bonds which had appreciated
significantly during the time the trust had held them. We re-deployed assets
into the 20- to 40-year segment of the market, generally favoring bonds with
premium (above-market) coupons and more defensive interest rate characteristics.
As the yield curve continued to flatten, these bonds contributed strong
performance. Additionally, we kept the overall duration of the trust defensively
positioned during the period. (Duration is a measure of interest rate
sensitivity.)

At the end of the period, bonds rated AA or higher accounted for approximately
78 percent of holdings. As investors pursued the yields available among lower
quality bonds, the portfolio's high grade exposure limited relative performance.

Within the context of our quality focused approach, we sought opportunities to
enhance the trust's yield. We increased the trust's exposure to BBB rated
securities from less than 3 percent to more than 10 percent at the end of the
period. This increased allocation to higher-yielding securities served the trust
well. Long-term investment-grade tobacco revenue bonds were included in these
purchases, and represented approximately 4 percent of assets at the end of the
period.

The trust maintained a high level of diversification among the major sectors of
the New York municipal market. At the close of the period, the largest sector
representations were hospital, general purpose and water and sewer.

In October, Van Kampen New York Quality Municipal Income Trust and Van Kampen
New York Value Municipal Income Trust were reorganized into Van Kampen Trust for
Investment Grade New York Municipals. We believe the larger asset base should
provide greater flexibility in structuring the trust and in purchasing larger
blocks of securities that offer particularly compelling opportunities.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform well
or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in the future.

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

The Trust recently approved a change in its investment policies to allow the
Trust to invest up to 15% of its net assets in "inverse floating rate
obligations." Floating rate obligations bear rates of interest that are adjusted
periodically to reflect changes in market rates of interest. Inverse floating
rate obligations have rates that vary inversely with changes in market rates of
interest. These securities have varying degrees of liquidity and the market
value of such securities generally will fluctuate in response to changes in
market rates of interest to a greater extent than the value of an equal
principal amount of a fixed rate security having similar credit quality,
redemption provisions and maturity.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 25, 2005, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. Finally, the Board considered materials it had received in
approving a change in the advisory fee rate effective November 1, 2004 and
materials it had received in approving a reorganization of the Fund. The Board
of Trustees considered the contract over a period of several months and the
non-management trustees held sessions both with the investment adviser and
separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of

                                                                               7
<PAGE>

factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The trustees also
discuss certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis
by the investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including
certain accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined
that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment
adviser support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this
Fund relative to comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and
others in the marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but
other fees and expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others)
and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the
performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the
investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of a special ad hoc
committee of the Board. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser its
revenues and expenses, including among other things, revenues for advisory
services, portfolio management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement

costs and allocated expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The Board
has determined that the analysis of the investment adviser's expenses and
profitability support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began

   losses per share by $.01 and increase the ratio of net investment income to
   average net assets applicable to common shares by .05%. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for periods prior to October 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

   period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of
   all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the period
   indicated.

(c)Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- OCTOBER 31, 2005

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment, but may invest up to 20% of its assets in unrated securities which
are believed to be of comparable quality to those rated investment grade. The
Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day on the
exchange on which they are traded. Short-term securities with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At October 31, 2005, the Trust had $5,000,000 of when-issued
and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually on a pro rata basis to common and preferred

purposes.

2005 and 2004 was as follows:

                                                              $304,098    $2,715,422

</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gain/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A permanent book and
tax difference relating to a distribution reclass of $148 was reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
gain. Additionally, a permanent book and tax difference of $153,900 relating to
merger costs which are not deductible for tax purposes was reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to paid in surplus. A permanent
difference relating to book to tax accretion differences totaling $3,701 was
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized gain.

    As of October 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $  163,785
Undistributed long-term capital gain........................   4,690,676
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of gains or losses recognized for tax purposes on
open futures transactions at October 31, 2005.

                                                                              23

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
of the Trust. Effective November 1, 2004, the investment advisory fee was
reduced from .60% to .55%.

    For the year ended October 31, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $13,700 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher, & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer ("CCO") Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the year ended October 31, 2005,
the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $51,500, representing Van Kampen
Investment Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as, the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Legal" expenses on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Other" expenses on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

Van Kampen New York Quality Municipal Trust (ticker symbol VNM) and Van Kampen
New York Value Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol VNV) through a tax free
reorganization approved by VNM and VNV shareholders on October 21, 2005. The
Trust issued 5,253,319 common shares and 1,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS")
with a net asset value of $88,308,273 and

liquidation value of $45,000,000, respectively, in exchange for VNM's net
assets. The Trust issued 4,017,876 common shares and 1,600 APS with a net asset
value of $67,540,588 and liquidation value of $40,000,000, respectively, in
exchange for VNV's net assets. The shares of VNM were converted into Trust
shares at a ratio of 0.928864 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS,
respectively. The shares of VNV were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of
0.936312 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS, respectively. Included in
these net assets was a deferred compensation and retirement plan balance of
$486,347 which is included with accumulated undistributed net investment income.
Net unrealized appreciation on VNM and VNV as of October 28, 2005 were
$5,509,076 and $5,816,625, respectively. The Trust assumed VNM and VNV's book to
tax accretion differences, which resulted in a $456,025 increase to accumulated
undistributed net investment income and a corresponding decrease to net
unrealized appreciation. Combined net assets applicable to common shares on the
day of reorganization were $260,233,331 and combined net assets including
preferred shares were $405,233,331, which included gains or losses of $565,780
recognized for tax purposes on open future transactions at merger date of
October 28, 2005. The Trust incurred merger expenses of $153,900, which
represent costs related to the preparation, printing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Reorganization Agreement and registration statements
as well as legal, audit and filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $76,216,458 and $77,102,648,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    In order to seek to manage the interest rate exposure of the Trust's
portfolio in a changing interest rate environment, the Trust may purchase or
sell financial futures contracts or engage in transactions involving interest
rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or
fixed-income market changes, for duration management or for risk purposes, but
may also enter into these transactions to generate additional income. All of the
Trust's portfolio holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to
market each day with the change in value reflected in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation. Upon disposition, a realized gain or loss is
recognized accordingly, except when taking delivery of a security underlying a
futures contract. In this instance, the recognition of gain or loss is postponed
until the disposal of the security underlying the futures contract. Risks may
arise as a result of the potential inability of the counter parties to meet the
terms of their contracts.

    During the period, the Trust invested in futures contracts, a type of
derivative. A futures contract is an agreement involving the delivery of a
particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The Trust
generally invests in exchange traded futures on U.S. Treasury Bonds and Notes
and typically closes the contract prior to delivery date. Upon entering into
futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of cash or liquid securities
with a value equal to a percentage of the contract amount with either a future
commission merchant pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated under the 1940
Act, as amended, or with its custodian in an account in the broker's name. This
amount is known as initial

                                                                              25

margin. During the period the futures contract is open, payments are received
from or made to the broker based upon changes in the value of the contract (the
variation margin). The risk of loss associated with a futures contract is in
excess of the variation margin reflected on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

    Transactions in futures contracts for the year ended October 31, 2005 were
as follows:

</Table>

6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust has outstanding 5,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS") in three
series. Series A contains 2,400 shares, Series B contains 1,800 shares and
Series C contains 1,600 shares. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates
are generally reset through an auction process every 28 days for Series A and B,
while Series C is generally reset every 7 days. The average rate in effect on
October 31, 2005 was 2.538%. During the year ended October 31, 2005, the rates
ranged from 1.700% to 2.850%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen Trust for Investment
Grade New York Municipals:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2005, the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of October 31, 2005, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals as of October 31, 2005,
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in Common Shares of the Trust. The Trust declares dividends out of
net investment income, and will distribute annually net realized capital gains,
if any. Common Shareholders may join or withdraw from the Plan at any time.

    If you decide to participate in the Plan, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as
your Plan Agent, will automatically invest your dividends and capital gains
distributions in Common Shares of the Trust for your account.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE

    If you wish to participate and your shares are held in your own name, call
1-800-341-2929 for more information and a Plan brochure. If your shares are held
in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your
nominee to see if it would participate in the Plan on your behalf. If you wish
to participate in the Plan, but your brokerage firm, bank or nominee is unable
to participate on your behalf, you should request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name which will enable your participation in the Plan.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    Participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in Common Shares valued
on the valuation date, generally at the lower of market price or net asset
value, except as specified below. The valuation date will be the dividend or
distribution payment date or, if that date is not a trading day on the national
securities exchange or market system on which the Common Shares are listed for
trading, the next preceding trading day. If the market price per Common Share on
the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per Common Share on that
date, the Trust will issue new Common Shares to participants valued at the
higher of net asset value or 95% of the market price on the valuation date. In
the foregoing situation, the Trust will not issue Common Shares under the Plan
below net asset value. If net asset value per Common Share on the valuation date
exceeds the market price per Common Share on that date, or if the Board of
Trustees should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable to the
Common Shareholders only in cash, participants in the Plan will be deemed to
have elected to receive Common Shares from the Trust valued at the market price
on that date. Accordingly, in this circumstance, the Plan Agent will, as agent
for the participants, buy the Trust's Common Shares in the open market for the
participants' accounts on or shortly after the payment date. If, before the Plan
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value
per share of the Common Shares, the average per share purchase price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

of the Trust's Common Shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common
Shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
issued by the Trust. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common Shares
and are carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
changes sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90 days before the
record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Agent by at least 90 days written notice to all Common
Shareholders of the Trust.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    Plan participants may withdraw at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., c/o Computershare Investor Services, P.O.
Box 43010, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3010. If you withdraw, you will
receive, without charge, a share certificate issued in your name for all full
Common Shares credited to your account under the Plan and a cash payment will be
made for any fractional Common Share credited to your account under the Plan.
You may again elect to participate in the Plan at any time by calling
1-800-341-2929 or writing to the Trust at:

Item 2. Code of Ethics.

(a) The Trust has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that applies
to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Trust or a third
party.

(b) No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c) The Trust has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by the
shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund.":

"Each Covered Officer must not use his personal influence or personal
relationship improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
indirectly)."

Further, due to personnel changes at the Adviser, the list of Covered Officers
set forth in Exhibit B and the General Counsel designee to whom questions about
the application of the Code should be referred in Exhibit C were amended during
the period. Exhibit B was then amended again in March 2005 and a third time in
August 2005 and a fourth time in September 2005. All four editions of Exhibit B
are attached. Additionally, Exhibit B was amended to remove Mitchell M. Merin as
a covered officer.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has two "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Trustees : Jerry Choate and R. Craig Kennedy. Under applicable
securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit committee financial
expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose, including without
limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a
result of being designated or identified as an audit committee financial expert.
The designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial
expert does not impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liabilities
that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on such
person as a member of the audit committee and Board of Trustees in the absence
of such designation or identification.

                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)

1. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

      The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

      The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

      For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

      The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

      The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

- ----------
(1)   This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
      Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above,
      supercedes and replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from
      time to time.

(2)   Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
      meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

      The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

      The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.

2.    DELEGATION

      As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.    AUDIT SERVICES

      The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

      In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

      The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4.    AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

      Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

      The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in
Appendix B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the
Audit Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5.    TAX SERVICES

      The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

      Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6.    ALL OTHER SERVICES

      The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

      The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

      A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7.    PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

      Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8.    PROCEDURES

      All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

      The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9.    ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

      The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.   COVERED ENTITIES

      Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

           CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

                AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2005

I.    This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
      Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and
      each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
      President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
      performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
      forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

      -     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships.

      -     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Fund;

      -     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

      -     prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      -     accountability for adherence to the Code.

            Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST

      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

      Each Covered Officer must not:

      -     use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
            influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
            whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
            indirectly);

      -     cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
            individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
            benefit of the Fund; or

      -     use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
            contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
            trade personally or cause others to trade personally in
            contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

      Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

      Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

      -     service or significant business relationships as a director on the
            board of any public or private company;

      -     accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
            and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
            with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings,
            not including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting
            events or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

            provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
            to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
            impropriety;

      -     any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than
            its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated
            person thereof; and

      -     a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
            compensation or equity ownership.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

      -     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
            disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
            Funds;

      -     each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
            others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
            within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
            Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators and
            self-regulatory organizations;

      -     each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
            area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
            the Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting
            full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
            reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
            in other public communications made by the Funds; and

      -     it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
            laws, rules and regulations.

IV.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

      Each Covered Officer must:

      -     upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
            Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
            received, read and understands the Code;

      -     annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with
            the requirements of the Code;

      -     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or
            any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
            potential violations that are made in good faith; and

      -     notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of
            any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
            of this Code.

      The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

      The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

      -     the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
            any potential violations reported to him;

      -     if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
            violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
            any further action;

      -     any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
            reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

      -     if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
            "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
            "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
            relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will
            consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
            appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
            notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or
            its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or
            other appropriate disciplinary actions;

      -     the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
            relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
            as appropriate; and

      -     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
            be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS

      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

- ----------
(3)   Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant
      of a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Trust For
      Investment Grade New York Municipals;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial

      include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
      periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as

      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d)
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

      a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
            registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
            to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
            period in which this report is being prepared;

      b)    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
            such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

            statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles;

      c)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

      d)    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
            control over financial reporting that occurred during the
            registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
            fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
            materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal controls over financial reporting.
