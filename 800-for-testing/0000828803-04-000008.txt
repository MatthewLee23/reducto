Franklin Templeton Investments

GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a leader in tax-free investing and a
driving force in fixed income investing around the globe. They also bring
expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Established in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style
of value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

Important Notice to Shareholders


SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Board of Directors of the Fund previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market transactions, at the discretion
of management. This authorization remains in effect.


CHANGE TO NON-FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT POLICY

In December 2003, the Fund's Board of Directors approved the elimination of the
Fund's non-fundamental investment policy limiting the Fund's investment in
Russian securities to no more than 5% of the Fund's total assets. The Board's
recent action allows the Fund's investment manager to take advantage of
additional attractive investment opportunities in Russia, in excess of 5% of the
Fund's total assets, when the investment manager believes it is advisable to do
so. The Fund's primary goal of seeking high current income and its secondary
goal of capital appreciation remain the same.

We are pleased to bring you Templeton Global Income Fund's semiannual report
covering the period ended February 29, 2004.


PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months ended February 29, 2004, Templeton Global Income Fund
delivered a 16.40% cumulative total return based on market price and 13.76%
based on net asset value, as shown in the Performance Summary on page 7. In
comparison, the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index (GGBI) posted a
3.02% cumulative total return in local currency terms and an 11.57% cumulative
total return in U.S. dollar terms for the same period.(1)


ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the period under review, global economic growth accelerated, led by the
U.S. and Asia. Global disinflationary trends continued, however, as excess
capacity in the largest global economies kept inflationary pressures tempered.
This low inflationary growth environment allowed most central banks to maintain
an accommodative monetary policy, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. As such,
many global bond markets enjoyed positive local market returns. In addition to
local market returns, the continued appreciation of many major currencies
against the U.S. dollar further contributed to global bond returns.

Despite solid growth in the U.S., core inflationary pressure continued a
downward trend, reaching the lowest levels since the 1960s. For most businesses,
strong

cyclical productivity gains from stronger growth and lower unit labor costs
supported the benign inflationary environment. The Federal Reserve Board left
the federal funds target interest rate unchanged, at the lowest level in more
than four decades. U.S. Treasury yields shifted downward as slower-than-expected
employment growth contributed to productivity gains. The U.S. current account
deficit remained at record levels, pressured by a widening trade deficit. The
U.S. dollar depreciated 8.5% relative to the nation's major trading partners for
the six months ended February 29, 2004.(2)

Economic growth remained lackluster in the European Monetary Union (EMU), rising
only 0.6% in 2003's fourth quarter.(3) Despite a significant rebound in business
confidence indicators, domestic demand remained weak across the EMU, threatening
to hinder broader economic recovery. Slow economic growth, along with a strong
euro, moderated EMU inflationary trends. Short-term interest rates in other
European economies continued to converge toward EMU rates; for example,
Scandinavian central banks employed aggressive monetary easing to stimulate
economic growth amid declining inflation. Norway and Sweden, however, maintained
strong balance of payment positions, ending 2003 with current account surpluses
of 13% and 7% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to a current account
deficit of approximately 5% in the U.S. and a surplus of 1% in the EMU.(4)

Asia's regional growth cycle continued to improve, led by China's nearly 10%
annualized GDP growth in fourth quarter 2003.5 Additionally, export growth and
current account surpluses in many Asian countries supported international
reserve accumulation, particularly in Japan and among the newly industrialized
economies of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. At period-end, reserve levels
represented increases of 62%, 31%, 11% and 13%, respectively, over year-ago
figures.6 These economic trends supported currencies in the region, and hence
their bond market returns.

Emerging market credit fundamentals remained favorable, highlighted by this
year's large number of sovereign credit upgrades. For example, after only five
years since the Russian economic crisis, independent credit rating agency
Moody's Investors Service upgraded Russia's long-term foreign currency rating to

  WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
  goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
  particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
  and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.

investment grade, to Baa3 from Ba2.(7) In Asia, Standard & Poor's (S&P), another
independent credit rating agency, upgraded Indonesia's foreign sovereign credit
rating to B and the local currency to B+.(8) Likewise, Thailand received its
first sovereign credit rating upgrade from S&P since 1998, from A- to A for the
local currency rating.(8)


INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency rates
and credit risk.


MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

Overall, the main contributors to Fund performance were income, developed market
interest rate movements, currency returns and emerging market bonds. During the
period under review, the Fund benefited from its exposure to Swedish and
Norwegian bonds as their central banks continued to ease monetary policy. Sweden
and Norway reduced their reference interest rates during the period and their
local bond markets posted positive returns in U.S. dollar and local currency
terms. Conversely, Australia and New Zealand's central banks tightened monetary
policy. Despite higher rates, Australian and New Zealand bond markets generated
positive returns, rising 2.00% and 2.98% in local currency terms during the
period, according to the JPM GGBI.(1)

The U.S. dollar's depreciation against most major currencies positively impacted
Fund performance. Throughout the reporting period, the euro represented the
Fund's largest currency exposure. The euro appreciated 13.17% against the U.S.
dollar, with EMU bond markets returning 16.78% in U.S. dollar terms for the six
months ended February 29, 2004, as measured by the JPM EMU Government Bond
Index.9 In other European countries, the Danish krone appreciated 12.77% against
the U.S. dollar, the Swedish krona was up 12.32%, while the Norwegian krone rose
6.49% over the six-month period.10 The currency appreciation combined with local
market returns to produce strong bond market returns.

Currencies from other regions, particularly Asia, did not experience similar
appreciation against the U.S. dollar despite large trade surpluses with the U.S.
Of the roughly $40 billion monthly U.S. trade deficit, Asia accounted for about
$20 billion versus $7 billion in Western Europe. Consequently, we reallocated
some of the Fund's exposure away from the EMU and into Asia seeking to position
the Fund for potential global economic recovery as well as to take advantage of
the discrepancy between currency performance and macroeconomic trends.

The Australian and New Zealand dollars were once again the top-performing
developed country currencies, returning 19.20% and 18.78% against the U.S.
dollar during the period, bringing bond returns in U.S. dollar terms to 21.58%
and 22.49%.(1) Our overweighted positions in the two countries, relative to the
JPM GGBI, contributed to the Fund's strong performance during the period.
Australia and New Zealand, although running relatively large current account
deficits, differed from the U.S. in that they had balanced fiscal accounts. From
a balance of payments perspective, the current account deficits were balanced by
strong foreign investment flows in an economic environment of high yields
relative to other developed nations, as well as fiscal surpluses. Australia and
New Zealand also each exhibited strong economic growth during the year,
reporting 4.0% and 3.5% annualized GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2003.10
The monetary tightening, mentioned earlier, further bolstered interest rate
differentials relative to the U.S. and other developed markets, lending support
to currency strength.

Japan underperformed other developed bond markets in U.S. dollar terms,
returning only 8.75% during the period, driven by the 6.79% appreciation of the
yen against the U.S. dollar.(1, 11) Although Japan benefited from a cyclical
economic recovery and improving export strength, concerns remained about the
country's

banking sector and its drawn-out structural reform process. We sought exposure
to Asia's cyclical, regional economic recovery through a variety of regional
currencies without exposure to any country-specific risks in Japan.

The Fund also invested in emerging market sovereign debt that is typically
non-investment grade and compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher
income or coupon. During the six-month period, emerging market returns
contributed to Fund performance as the JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index Global
(EMBIG) delivered a strong total return of 9.32% in U.S. dollar terms for the
six months ended February 29, 2004.(12) Sovereign interest rate spreads fell
from 4.82 percentage points above the U.S. Treasury market at the beginning of
the reporting period to 4.31 percentage points by period-end.10 Reduced interest
rates in developed economies generally benefit emerging market borrowers through
lower borrowing costs and positive investment flows from investors seeking
higher returns outside developed countries. Regionally, Latin American sovereign
debt returned 10.24%, eastern Europe 10.03% and Asia 4.66%.(12)

Additionally, selective emerging local debt markets offered further
opportunities for diversification. We increased the Fund's exposure to euro and
local currency-denominated debt markets largely due to opportunities for
potential currency appreciation as well as attractive yields. Primarily, we
expanded and diversified the Fund's Asian exposure later in the reporting period
to include South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. Asia's regional cyclical
recovery supported growth rates while current account surpluses from competitive
trade conditions contributed to international reserve accumulation. This
resulted in stronger balance of payment conditions and better debt repayment
capacity. At the end of the reporting period, based on internal analysis 80.6%
of the Fund's holdings were investment grade and the average credit rating of
Fund holdings was AA-.

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCE; MORE RECENT RETURNS MAY DIFFER
FROM THOSE SHOWN. INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE WITH
MARKET CONDITIONS. SPECIAL RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN INVESTING,
INCLUDING CURRENCY VOLATILITY, ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTRIES WHERE THE FUND INVESTS. EMERGING MARKETS INVOLVE
HEIGHTENED RISKS RELATED TO THE SAME FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE ASSOCIATED
WITH THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND LESSER LIQUIDITY. ALSO, AS A
NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT COMPANY, THE FUND MAY INVEST IN A RELATIVELY SMALL
NUMBER OF ISSUERS AND, AS A RESULT, BE SUBJECT TO GREATER RISK OF LOSS WITH
RESPECT TO ITS PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. YOU MAY HAVE A GAIN OR LOSS WHEN YOU SELL
YOUR SHARES.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. The
Fund seeks high current income, with a secondary objective of capital
appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in a
portfolio of debt securities of U.S. and foreign issuers including emerging
markets.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange or NASDAQ are
valued at the last reported sales price. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of the
latest quoted bid and asked prices. Investments in open-end mutual funds are
valued at the closing net asset value. Foreign securities are valued at the
close of trading of the foreign exchange or the NYSE, whichever is earlier. If
events occur that materially affect the values of securities after the prices or
foreign exchange rates are determined, or if market quotations are not readily
available, the securities will be valued at fair value as determined following
procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the recorded
amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S.
dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates
on foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in
securities held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included
in the Statement of Operations.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS (CONTINUED)

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Certain income from foreign securities is recorded as soon as information is
available to the Fund. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.
Discounts and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of
the respective securities. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Funds. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

The Board of Directors of the Fund previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market transactions, at the discretion
of management. This authorization remains in effect. Through February 29, 2004,
the Fund had repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares.

At February 29, 2004, there were 200 million shares authorized ($0.01 par
value). During the period ended February 29, 2004, 166,612 shares were issued
for $1,471,084 from reinvested distributions. During the year ended August 31,
2003, 6,265 shares were issued for $43,136 from reinvested distributions.

4. INCOME TAXES

At February 29, 2004, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments .....................................   $999,534,172
                                                            ------------

                                                            ------------

Net investment income and net realized capital gains differ for financial
statement and tax purposes primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales,
losses realized subsequent to October 31 on the sale of securities, and bond
discounts and premiums.

At August 31, 2003, the Fund had tax basis capital losses, which may be carried
over to offset future capital gains. Such losses expire as follows:

Capital loss carryovers expiring in:

 2007 ...................................................    $   134,135

At August 31, 2003, the Fund had deferred capital losses occurring subsequent to

period ended February 29, 2004 aggregated $246,503,751 and $232,503,548,
respectively.


6. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund. The Fund earned $37,826 of dividend income from investment in
the Sweep Money Fund for the period ended February 29, 2004.


7. REGULATORY MATTERS

On February 4, 2004, the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an administrative complaint against
Franklin Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company"),
alleging violations of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act. The complaint
arises from activity that occurred in 2001 during which time an officer of a
Company subsidiary was negotiating an agreement with an investor relating to
investments in a mutual fund and a hedge fund.

The Fund, in addition to other entities within Franklin Templeton Investments,
including the Company and other funds, has been named in shareholder class and
derivative lawsuits related to the matter described above, as well as actions
seeking the return of certain management and other fees to the Fund. The Fund's
management believes that the claims made in the lawsuit are without merit and it
intends to defend vigorously against the allegations. It is anticipated that the
Fund may be named in additional similar civil actions related to the matter
described above.

7. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

In addition, as part of ongoing investigations by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of
California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney General, the
U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the Florida Department of
Financial Services, and the Commissioner of Securities and the Attorney General
of the State of West Virginia, relating to certain practices in the mutual fund
industry, including late trading, market timing and sales compensation
arrangements, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current or
former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for
information and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and
its current employees are providing documents and information in response to
these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to requests
for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the
foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management
business.

The Staff of the SEC has informed the Company that it intends to recommend that
the Commission authorize an action against the Fund's investment adviser
relating to the frequent trading issues that are the subject of the SEC's
investigation. These issues were previously disclosed as being under
investigation by government authorities and the subject of an internal inquiry
by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and on its public website. The
Company currently is in discussions with the SEC Staff in an effort to resolve
the issues raised in their investigation. The Fund's management has been advised
that the Company cannot predict the likelihood of whether those discussions will
result in a settlement and, if so, the terms of such settlement. The impact, if
any, of these matters on the Fund is uncertain at this time. If the Company
finds that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or improper conduct, it has
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN


The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; Stock
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to Mellon Bank,
N.A. (the "Plan Agent"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of
$5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These
payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A."
and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA
15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc. The Plan Agent shall
apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of
trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Agent sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box
3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Agent; or, if the participant wishes, the Plan
Agent will sell the participant's shares and send the proceeds, less a service
charge of $15.00 and less trading fees.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

Effective February 12, 2004, the Plan's Agent's fees for a sale of shares
through the Plan will be $15.00 per transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading
fee. All other terms and conditions of the Plan remain in effect and have not
been modified or amended.

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code")/1/ is for the investment  companies within
the complex  registered with the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

   o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
     relationships;

   o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
     documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other
     public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

   o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

   o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
     person or persons identified in the Code; and

   o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
    INTEREST OVERVIEW.

     A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private interest
interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the FT Funds. For example,
a conflict of  interest  would  arise if a Covered  Officer, or a member of his
family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with the
FT Funds.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships  between
Covered Officers  and the FT Funds and  already are subject  to conflict  of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund  administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three),  be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers may also be officers or employees of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code,  but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly before the
interest of the FT Funds. Each Covered Officer must:

   o Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
     influence  investment decisions or financial  reporting  by the FT Funds
     whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
     the FT Funds;

   o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
     individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
     the FT Funds;

   o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
     Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
     are made in good faith;

   o Report at least annually the following affiliations or  other
     relationships:/2/

   o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
     required to file reports with the SEC;

   o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
     directors;

   o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
     accounting firm; and

   o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund that
     will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from the advisory,
     sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with  affiliates  of
     Franklin Resources).

   There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3/:

  o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

  o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

  o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT
    Funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such
    entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
    time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
    impropriety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must
    obtain prior approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of
    $1000.

  o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
    with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
    adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
    thereof;

  o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
    charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
    transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
    arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
    equity ownership.

    FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

   o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
     requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

   o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
     to  misrepresent,  facts  about the FT Funds to others,  whether  within or
     outside the FT Funds,  including to the FT Funds'  directors  and auditors,
     and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

   o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
     responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
     the adviser and the  administrator  with the goal of promoting full,  fair,
     accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents
     the FT  Funds  file  with,  or  submit  to,  the  SEC and in  other  public
     communications made by the FT Funds; and

   o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote  compliance
     with the standards and  restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules and
     regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

   Each Covered Officer must:

   o Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as  applicable, upon becoming a
     Covered  Officer), affirm in writing to the Board  that he has  received,
     read, and understands the Code (see  Exhibit  B);

   o Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied  with the
     requirements of the Code; and

   o Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he
     knows of any violation of this Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself  is a
     violation of this Code.

     FT's  General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation./4/
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

   o FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
     action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;

   o If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy  General
     Counsel  believes that no violation has occurred,  FT's General  Counsel is
     not required to take any further action;

   o Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes
     is a  violation  will be reported to the Independent Directors  of the
     appropriate FT Fund;

   o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred,  it
     will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the  appropriate
     Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of,
     and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
     notification to appropriate  personnel of the investment adviser or its
     board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

   o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
     appropriate; and

   o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
     disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted  by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures  of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code.  The FT Code of Ethics and Policy  Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority  vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.




- ---------------------

1. Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered  management  investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted  such a code of ethics,  it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant  must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet  website and
disclose,  in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet  website;  or (3)  undertake in
its most recent  report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person  without  charge,
upon  request,  a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such  request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit  waivers)  from,  a provision  of the code in the  registrant's  annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose  amendments  and waivers by posting such  information on
its  website,  it will be  required to disclose  its  Internet  address and this
intention.

2. Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing  the Directors  and Officers  Questionnaire  and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel.

3. Any  activity or  relationship  that would  present a conflict  for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
of the Covered  Officer's  immediate  family  engages in such an activity or has
such a  relationship.  The Cover Person should also obtain  written  approval by
FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4. FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate,  with members of the Audit  Committee,  counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent  Directors,  and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR  defines  "waiver" as "the  approval by the  registrant of a material
departure  from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit  waiver," which
must also be  disclosed,  as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a
reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the
code of  ethics  that  has  been  made  known to an  executive  officer"  of the
registrant.
