       was registered and began operations on March 10, 2004 ("Inception") as a
       nondiversified, closed-end management investment company under the
       Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Fund was created to
       serve as a feeder fund for The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the "Master
       Fund"). For convenience, reference to the Fund may include the Master
       Fund, as the context requires.

       The Fund's investment objective is to preserve capital and to generate
       consistent long-term appreciation and returns across all market cycles.
       The Fund will pursue its investment objective by investing substantially
       all of its assets in the Master Fund, which invests its assets in a
       variety of investment vehicles including but not limited to limited
       partnerships and limited liability companies (collectively, the
       "Investment Funds"), registered investment companies and direct
       investments in marketable securities and other derivative instruments.
       The Fund's investments are managed by a select group of investment
       managers identified by the Adviser, as hereinafter defined, to have
       investments that when grouped with other investments of the Fund result
       in a portfolio that is allocated more broadly across markets, asset
       classes, and risk profiles. The financial statements and notes of the
       Master Fund, including the schedule of investments, are an integral part
       of these financial statements, are included elsewhere in this report and
       should be read in conjunction with the Fund's financial statements. The
       percentage of the Master Fund's partnership interests owned by the Fund
       on June 30, 2004 was 6.47%.

       The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, serves as
       the general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner"). To the fullest
       extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner has irrevocably
       delegated to a board of directors ("the Board"), a majority of which are
       independent of the General Partner and its management, its rights and
       powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Fund, including
       the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies
       regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
       To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any of
       its rights, powers and authority to, among others, the officers of the
       Fund, the Adviser, or any committee of the Board.

       The Board is authorized to engage an investment adviser and it has
       selected Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the "Adviser"), to manage the Fund's
       portfolio and operations, pursuant to the investment management agreement
       (the "Investment Management Agreement"). The Adviser is a Delaware
       limited partnership that is registered as an investment adviser under the
       Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"). Under the
       Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the
       establishment of an investment committee (the "Investment Committee"),
       which is responsible for developing, implementing, and supervising the
       Fund's investment program subject to the ultimate supervision of the
       Board. In addition to investment advisory services, the Adviser also
       functions as the servicing agent of the Fund (the "Servicing Agent") and
       as such provides investor services and administrative assistance to the
       Fund. The Adviser can delegate all or a portion of its duties as
       Servicing Agent to other parties, who would in turn act as sub-servicing
       agents.

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

       The General Partner and the Adviser are owned by MWY Consulting, LLC, a
       limited liability company controlled by Mark W. Yusko ("MWY"), Salient
       Endowment Enterprises, LLC, a limited liability company controlled by
       Messrs. Andrew B. Linbeck, Jeremy L. Radcliffe and A. Haag Sherman
       ("SEE"), and John A. Blaisdell, J. Matthew Newtown, John E. Price and
       Adam L. Thomas (individually). Such individuals, together with Sanders
       Morris Harris Group ("SMHG"), MWY and SEE, are collectively referred to
       herein as the "Principals." Messrs. Blaisdell, Linbeck, Sherman and Yusko
       are also members of the Investment Committee of the Adviser. SMHG holds a
       profits interest in the General Partner and the Adviser. The profits
       interests terminated on May 10, 2004, after which date SMHG had an option
       to acquire a minority ownership interest in the General Partner and the
       Adviser exercisable by June 30, 2004; such option periods have been
       extended. The General Partner anticipates that SMHG will exercise its
       purchase options.

(2)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

       (a)    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

              The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the
              accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting
              principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

       (b)    CASH EQUIVALENTS

              The Fund considers all unpledged temporary cash investments with a
              maturity date at the time of purchase of three months or less to
              be cash equivalents.

       (c)    INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

              The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.

              Securities owned or sold, not yet purchased, are marked to
              estimated fair value at the date of the financial statements, and
              the corresponding unrealized gain or loss is included in the
              statement of operations.

              Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are
              accounted for based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.

              Distributions received from investments, whether in the form of
              cash or securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the
              investment.

       (d)    VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

              The valuation of the Fund's investments will be determined as of
              the close of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally
              monthly. The valuation of the Fund's investments is ordinarily
              calculated by Citco Fund Services, Ltd. (or an affiliate thereof,
              collectively "Citco"), the Fund's independent administrator (the
              "Independent Administrator") in consultation with the Adviser. The
              Fund's investments are ordinarily based upon valuations provided
              to it by the investment managers of such Investment Funds or, in
              many cases, the administrators of those Investment Funds. The
              valuation of the Investment Funds is reviewed by a committee
              approved by the Board and

                                        7                           (Continued)

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A Limited Partnership)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

              established to oversee the valuation of the Fund's investments
              (the "Valuation Committee"), in consultation with the Adviser and
              the Independent Administrator. The Fund records its investment in
              the Master Fund using the equity method, which approximates fair
              value. Valuation of the investments held by the Master Fund is
              discussed in the notes to the Master Fund financial statements
              included elsewhere in this report. The net assets of the Fund will
              equal the value of the total assets of the Fund, less all of its
              liabilities, including accrued fees and expenses.

              Investments are valued as follows:

              -      INVESTMENT FUNDS - Investments in Investment Funds are
                     ordinarily valued at the valuations provided to the
                     Independent Administrator by the investment managers of
                     such Investment Funds or the administrators of those
                     Investment Funds. The Fund's investments in Investment
                     Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the
                     respective operating agreements and offering memoranda, as
                     appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
                     carried at estimated fair value as determined by the Fund's
                     pro-rata interest in the net assets of each Investment
                     Fund. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
                     this estimated fair value may differ from the value that
                     would have been used had a ready market for the investments
                     in Investment Funds existed. These Investment Funds value
                     their underlying investments in accordance with policies
                     established by such Investment Funds. All valuations
                     utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
                     Fund and are net of management and estimated performance
                     incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment
                     Funds' managers pursuant to the Investment Funds'
                     agreements.

              -      SECURITIES LISTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE - In general,
                     the Fund values listed securities at their last sales price
                     as of the last business day of the applicable period. If no
                     sales occurred on that date, the securities are valued at
                     the mean between the "bid" and "asked" prices at the close
                     of trading on that date.

              -      SECURITIES LISTED ON OVER-THE-COUNTER EXCHANGES -
                     Securities listed on over-the-counter exchanges are valued
                     at the last reported sales price on the date of
                     determination, if available, through the facilities of a
                     recognized interdealer quotation system (such as securities
                     in the NASDAQ National Market List) or at the NASDAQ
                     Official Closing Price. If the last reported sales price is
                     not available, the securities are valued at the mean
                     between the "bid" and "asked" prices at the close of
                     trading on that date.

              -      OPTIONS - Options that are listed on a securities exchange
                     or traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between
                     the closing "bid" and "asked" prices for such options on
                     the date of determination.

              -      SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED - the value of securities,
                     derivatives, or synthetic securities that are not actively
                     traded on an exchange shall be determined by an
                     unaffiliated pricing service that may use actual trade data
                     or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield curves,
                     specific trading characteristics of certain groups of
                     securities, pricing models, or a combination of these
                     procedures.

                                        8                           (Continued)

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                             (A Limited Partnership)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

              -      OTHER - Where no value is readily available from an
                     Investment Fund or other security or where a value supplied
                     by an Investment Fund is deemed not to be indicative of the
                     Investment Fund's value, the Valuation Committee and/or the
                     Board, in consultation with the Independent Administrator
                     or the Adviser will determine, in good faith, the fair
                     value of the Investment Fund or security.

       (e)    INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME

              Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest
              income is recorded as earned on the accrual basis.

       (f)    FUND EXPENSES

              The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including,
              but not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related
              to investment transactions and positions for the Fund's account;
              legal fees; accounting, auditing and tax preparation fees;
              custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
              costs of insurance; registration expenses; certain offering costs;
              expenses of meetings of the partners; directors fees; all costs
              with respect to communications to partners; and other types of
              expenses as may be approved from time to time by the General
              Partner. Offering costs are amortized and charged against the
              partners' capital accounts over a twelve-month period from the
              date they are incurred.

       (g)    INCOME TAXES

              The Fund is not subject to federal, state, or local income taxes
              because such taxes are the responsibility of the individual
              partners in the Fund. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes
              has been made in the Fund's financial statements.

       (h)    USE OF ESTIMATES

              The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with
              accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
              America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
              relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
              disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
              financial statements and the reported amounts of income and
              expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
              from those estimates.

       (i)    ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

              The Fund's organizational expenses (the "Organizational Expenses")
              will initially be borne by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof and
              for capital account allocation purposes assumed to be reimbursed,
              over not more than a 60 month period of time, notwithstanding that
              generally accepted accounting principles require that these costs
              be expensed upon commencement of operations.

                                        9                           (Continued)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

(3)    PARTNERS' CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

       (a)    ISSUANCE OF INTERESTS

              Upon receipt from an eligible investor of an application for
              interests (the "Interests"), which will generally be accepted as
              of the first day of each month based on the Fund's estimated fair
              value, the Fund will issue new Interests. The Interests have not
              been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
              "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state. The Fund
              issues Interests only in private placement transactions in
              accordance with Regulation D or other applicable exemptions under
              the Securities Act. No public market exists for the Interests, and
              none is expected to develop. Since the Interests will not be
              listed on any securities exchange, the Fund is not required, and
              does not intend, to hold annual meetings of its partners. The
              Interests are subject to substantial restrictions on
              transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
              except as permitted under the Fund's limited partnership agreement
              (the "LP Agreement"). The Fund reserves the right to reject any
              applications for Interests. The $1,727,187 in subscriptions
              received in advance as of June 30, 2004 represents subscriptions
              for Fund Interests received prior to the July 2004 closing.

       (b)    ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

              For each fiscal period, net profits or net losses of the Fund,
              including allocations from the Master Fund, are allocated among
              and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of all
              partners as of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance
              with the partners' respective investment percentages for the
              fiscal period. Net profits or net losses are measured as the net
              change in the value of the net assets of the Fund, including any
              net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of
              investments and income, net of expenses, and realized gains or
              losses during a fiscal period, before giving effect to any
              repurchases by the Fund of Interests or portions of Interests.

       (c)    REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS

              A partner will not be eligible to have the Fund repurchase all or
              any portion of an Interest at any time prior to the business day
              immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of the partner's
              purchase of such Interest (or portion thereof) without incurring
              additional costs including an early repurchase fee. The Adviser,
              which also serves as the investment adviser of the Master Fund,
              expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to
              repurchase such Interests each calendar quarter, beginning on or
              about December 31, 2004 pursuant to written tenders by partners.
              The Board retains the sole discretion to accept or reject the
              recommendation of the Adviser. Since the Fund's assets are
              invested in the Master Fund, the ability of the Fund to redeem its
              interests in the Master Fund would be subject to the Master Fund's
              repurchase policy. In addition, the Fund may determine not to
              conduct a repurchase offer each time the Master Fund conducts a
              repurchase offer. In the event Interests are redeemed, there will
              be a substantial period of time between the date as of which
              partners must tender their Interests for repurchase and the date
              they can expect to receive payment for their Interests from the
              Fund.

                                       10                           (Continued)

                                  June 30, 2004

(4)    INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

       As of June 30, 2004, all of the investments made by the Fund were in the
       Master Fund. The $477,117 in prepaid contribution to the Master Fund as
       of June 30, 2004 represents funding of a portion of the July 2004
       investment in the Master Fund.

       From Inception of the Fund through June 30, 2004, the aggregate cost of
       purchases and proceeds from sales of portfolio securities were
       $14,381,008 and $0, respectively.

       The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
       items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from its investments. The
       allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by its investments on
       Schedules K-1 or 1099's. As of June 30, 2004, the cost of investments was
       $14,381,008. Accordingly, the net unrealized depreciation in investments
       was $212,998.

 (5)   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

       In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
       may invest either directly or through the Master Fund will trade various
       derivative securities and other financial instruments and enter into
       various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These
       activities may include, but are not limited to, short selling activities,
       writing option contracts interest rate swaps, futures contracts and
       options on futures, credit default swaps, use of leverage and total
       return equity swap contracts. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment
       Funds is limited to the value of the investment in such Investment Funds
       as reported by the Fund.

 (6)   SERVICING AGREEMENTS; ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

       In consideration for administrative services, the Master Fund pays the
       Independent Administrator a monthly administration fee (the
       "Administration Fee") based on the month end net assets of the Master
       Fund. The Administration Fee will equal 0.12% (on an annualized basis) of
       the Master Fund's month end net assets for the first $100 million of net
       assets, and 0.08% (on an annualized basis) of the Master Fund's month end
       net assets for that portion of the Master Fund's net assets that exceeds
       $100 million. In addition, on a monthly basis, the Master Fund pays an
       annual fee of $7,500 for each separately managed account (up to four
       separately managed accounts), and $15,000 for each additional separately
       managed account. The assets in such separately managed accounts are not
       charged the asset-based fee, but are included in the total net assets of
       the Master Fund for the purposes of determining whether the $100 million
       breakpoint is reached. The Independent Administrator charges the Master
       Fund a minimum annual fee of $36,000. As of June 30, 2004, the Master
       Fund had $218,656,981 in net assets and one separately managed account.
       The Administration Fee will be paid to the Independent Administrator out
       of the Master Fund's assets, which will decrease the net profits or
       increase the net losses of the partners in the Master Fund. The total
       Administration Fee incurred for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was
       $97,735. Citco and the Adviser have agreed to terminate the Fund's
       administrative agreement, effective October 13, 2004. The Fund is
       currently seeking a new independent administrator.

                                  June 30, 2004

(7)    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

       (a)    INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE

              In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by
              the Adviser to the Master Fund pursuant to the Investment
              Management Agreement, the Master Fund will pay the Adviser an
              investment management fee (the "Investment Management Fee"), equal
              to 1% on an annualized basis of the Master Fund's net assets,
              calculated based on the NAV at the end of each month, payable
              quarterly in arrears. The Investment Management Fee will decrease
              the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund and
              indirectly the Fund as the fees are debited against the capital
              accounts of the Master Fund's limited partners.

       (b)    SERVICING FEE

              In consideration for providing investor services and
              administrative assistance to the Fund, the Adviser will receive a
              servicing fee (the "Servicing Fee") equal to 1% (on an annualized
              basis) of each partner's capital account balance, calculated at
              the end of each month, payable quarterly in arrears.

              The Investment Management Fee is incurred at the Master Fund level
              and the Servicing Fees are incurred at the Fund level; however
              cash distributions are made from the Master Fund to the Fund to
              fund the payment of the Servicing Fees, which results in a
              commensurate adjustment to the Fund's partners' capital account in
              the Master Fund. The Adviser has chosen to waive the Servicing
              Fees, which would have amounted to $27,150 since Fund Inception.
              The Adviser reserves the right to reinstate the Servicing Fees at
              any time.

       (c)    PLACEMENT AGENTS

              The Fund may engage one or more placement agents (each, a
              "Placement Agent") to solicit investments in the Fund. Sanders
              Morris Harris, Inc. ("SMHI"), an affiliate of SMHG and the
              Adviser, has been engaged by the Master Fund to serve as a
              Placement Agent. SMHI is a full-service investment banking,
              broker-dealer, asset management and financial services
              organization. A Placement Agent may engage one or more
              sub-placement agents. The Adviser or its affiliates may pay a fee
              out of their own resources to Placement Agents and sub-placement
              agents.

(8)    INDEBTEDNESS OF THE FUND

       Pursuant to the Fund LP Agreement, the Fund may borrow up to, but not
       more than, 10% of the net assets of the Fund (at the time such borrowings
       were made and after taking into account the investment and/or deployment
       of such proceeds) for the purpose of making investments, funding
       redemptions and for other working capital and general Fund purposes. For
       purposes of the Fund's investment restrictions and certain investment
       limitations under the 1940 Act, including for example, the Fund's
       leverage limitations, the Fund will not "look through" Investment Funds
       in which the Fund invests. Investment Funds may also use leverage,
       whether through borrowings, futures, or other derivative products and are
       not subject to the Fund's investment restrictions. However, such
       borrowings are without recourse to the Fund and the

                                       12                           (Continued)

                                  June 30, 2004

       Fund's risk of loss is limited to its investment in such Investment
       Funds. The rights of any lenders to the Fund to receive payments of
       interest or repayments of principal will be senior to those of the
       partners, and the terms of any borrowings may contain provisions that
       limit certain activities of the Fund.

       None of the above calculations have been annualized.

       (1) Ratios are calculated by dividing by average partners' capital
           measured at the beginning of the first month in the period and at the
           end of each month during the period.

       (2) Calculated as geometrically linked monthly returns for each month in
           the period. Monthly returns are calculated as net increase (decrease)
           in partners' capital resulting from operations for the month divided
           by opening partners' capital for the month. Opening partners' capital
           represents the balance of partners' capital at the beginning of the
           month, after taking into account contributions, allocations, and
           distributions.

(10)   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

       The Fund established a credit facility in July 2004 for which the
       investments of the Fund serve as collateral for the facility. The maximum
       amount that can be borrowed is based on the value of the underlying
       collateral; provided, however, that the Fund's fundamental policies
       provide that the Fund cannot borrow more than 10% of the value of the
       Fund's net assets. There are currently no amounts outstanding under such
       facility.

                             (A Limited Partnership)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

(1)    ORGANIZATION

       The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a limited partnership
       organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Fund began
       operations in April 2003 ("Inception"). The Fund operated as an
       unregistered investment vehicle until March 10, 2004, at which time it
       registered as a nondiversified, closed-end management investment company
       under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Fund is
       the master fund in a master-feeder structure in which there are five
       feeder funds.

       The Fund's investment objective is to preserve capital and to generate
       consistent long-term appreciation and returns across all market cycles.
       The Fund will pursue its investment objective by investing its assets in
       a variety of investment vehicles including but not limited to limited
       partnerships and limited liability companies (collectively, the
       "Investment Funds"), registered investment companies and direct
       investments in marketable securities and other derivative instruments.
       The Fund's investments are managed by a select group of investment
       managers identified by the Adviser, as hereinafter defined, to have
       investments that when grouped with other investments of the Fund result
       in a portfolio that is allocated more broadly across markets, asset
       classes, and risk profiles.

       The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, serves as
       the general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner"). To the fullest
       extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner has irrevocably
       delegated its rights and powers to a board of directors (the "Board"), a
       majority of which are independent of the General Partner and its
       management, to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Fund,
       including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish
       policies regarding the management, conduct, and operation of the Fund's
       business. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may
       delegate any of its rights, powers and authority to, among others, the
       officers of the Fund, the Adviser, or any committee of the Board.

       The Board is authorized to engage an investment adviser and it has
       selected Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the "Adviser"), to manage the Fund's
       portfolio and operations, pursuant to the investment management agreement
       (the "Investment Management Agreement"). The Adviser is a Delaware
       limited partnership that is registered as an investment adviser under the
       Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"). Under the
       Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the
       establishment of an investment committee (the "Investment Committee"),
       which is responsible for developing, implementing, and supervising the
       Fund's investment program subject to the ultimate supervision of the
       Board. In addition to investment advisory services, the Adviser also
       functions as the servicing agent of the Fund (the "Servicing Agent") and
       as such provides investor services and administrative assistance to the
       Fund. The Adviser can delegate all or a portion of its duties as
       Servicing Agent to other parties, who would in turn act as sub-servicing
       agents.

       The General Partner and the Adviser are owned by MWY Consulting, LLC, a
       limited liability company controlled by Mark W. Yusko ("MWY"), Salient
       Endowment Enterprises, LLC, a limited liability company controlled by
       Messrs. Andrew B. Linbeck, Jeremy L. Radcliffe and A. Haag Sherman
       ("SEE"), and John A. Blaisdell, J. Matthew Newtown, John E. Price and
       Adam L. Thomas (individually). Such individuals, together with Sanders
       Morris Harris Group ("SMHG"), MWY and SEE, are collectively referred to
       herein as the "Principals." Messrs. Blaisdell, Linbeck, Sherman and Yusko
       are also members of

       the Investment Committee of the Adviser. SMHG holds a profits interest in
       the General Partner and the Adviser. The profits interests terminated on
       May 10, 2004, after which date SMHG had an option to acquire a minority
       ownership interest in the General Partner and the Adviser exercisable by
       June 30, 2004; such option periods have been extended. The General
       Partner anticipates that SMHG will exercise its purchase options.

(2)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

       (a)    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

              The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the
              accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting
              principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

       (b)    CASH EQUIVALENTS

              The Fund considers all unpledged temporary cash investments with a
              maturity date at the time of purchase of three months or less to
              be cash equivalents.

       (c)    INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

              The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.

              Securities owned or sold, not yet purchased, are marked to
              estimated fair value at the date of the financial statements, and
              the corresponding unrealized gain or loss is included in the
              statement of operations.

              Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are
              accounted for based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.

              Distributions received from investments, whether in the form of
              cash or securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the
              investment.

       (d)    VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

              The valuation of the Fund's investments will be determined as of
              the close of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally
              monthly. The valuation of the Fund's investments is ordinarily
              calculated by Citco Fund Services, Ltd. (or an affiliate thereof,
              collectively "Citco"), the Fund's independent administrator (the
              "Independent Administrator") in consultation with the Adviser. The
              Fund's investments are ordinarily based upon valuations provided
              to it by the investment managers of such Investment Funds or, in
              many cases, the administrators of those Investment Funds. The
              valuation of the Investment Funds is reviewed by a committee
              approved by the Board and established to oversee the valuation of
              the Fund's investments (the "Valuation Committee"), in
              consultation with the Adviser and the Independent Administrator.
              The net assets of the Fund will equal the value of the total
              assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued
              fees and expenses.

                                       24                           (Continued)

                         THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                             (A Limited Partnership)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

              Investments are valued as follows:

              -      INVESTMENT FUNDS -- Investments in Investment Funds are
                     ordinarily valued at the valuations provided to the
                     Independent Administrator by the investment managers of
                     such Investment Funds or the administrators of those
                     Investment Funds. The Fund's investments in Investment
                     Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the
                     respective operating agreements and offering memoranda, as
                     appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
                     carried at estimated fair value as determined by the Fund's
                     pro-rata interest in the net assets of each Investment
                     Fund. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
                     this estimated fair value may differ from the value that
                     would have been used had a ready market for the investments
                     in Investment Funds existed. These Investment Funds value
                     their underlying investments in accordance with policies
                     established by such Investment Funds. All valuations
                     utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
                     Fund and are net of management and estimated performance
                     incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment
                     Funds' managers pursuant to the Investment Funds'
                     agreements.

              -      SECURITIES LISTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE - In general,
                     the Fund values listed securities at their last sales price
                     as of the last business day of the applicable period. If no
                     sales occurred on that date, the securities are valued at
                     the mean between the "bid" and "asked" prices at the close
                     of trading on that date.

              -      SECURITIES LISTED ON OVER-THE-COUNTER EXCHANGES -
                     Securities listed on over-the-counter exchanges are valued
                     at the last reported sales price on the date of
                     determination, if available, through the facilities of a
                     recognized interdealer quotation system (such as securities
                     in the NASDAQ National Market List) or at the NASDAQ
                     Official Closing Price. If the last reported sales price is
                     not available, the securities are valued at the mean
                     between the "bid" and "asked" prices at the close of
                     trading on that date.

              -      OPTIONS - Options that are listed on a securities exchange
                     or traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between
                     the closing `bid' and `asked' prices for such options on
                     the date of determination.

              -      SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED - the value of securities,
                     derivatives, or synthetic securities that are not actively
                     traded on an exchange shall be determined by an
                     unaffiliated pricing service that may use actual trade data
                     or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield curves,
                     specific trading characteristics of certain groups of
                     securities, pricing models, or a combination of these
                     procedures.

              -      OTHER - Where no value is readily available from an
                     Investment Fund or other security or where a value supplied
                     by an Investment Fund is deemed not to be indicative of the
                     Investment Fund's value, the Valuation Committee and/or the
                     Board, in consultation with the Independent Administrator
                     or the Adviser will determine, in good faith, the fair
                     value of the Investment Fund or security.

                                       25                           (Continued)

              with respect to communications to partners; and other types of
              expenses as may be approved from time to time by the General
              Partner. Offering costs are amortized and charged against the
              partners' capital accounts over a twelve-month period from the
              date they are incurred.

       (g)    INCOME TAXES

              The Fund itself is not subject to federal, state, or local income
              taxes because such taxes are the responsibility of the individual
              partners in the Fund. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes
              has been made in the Fund's financial statements other than
              withholding tax on dividend income that is allocated to the Fund's
              offshore feeders.

       (h)    USE OF ESTIMATES

              The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with
              accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
              America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
              relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
              disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
              financial statements and the reported amounts of income and
              expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
              from those estimates.

       (i)    ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

              The Fund's organizational expenses (the "Organizational Expenses")
              will initially be borne by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof and
              for capital account allocation purposes assumed to be reimbursed,
              over not more than a 60 month period of time, notwithstanding that
              generally accepted accounting principles require that these costs
              be expensed upon commencement of operations.

(3)    PARTNERS' CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

       (a)    ISSUANCE OF INTERESTS

              Upon receipt from an eligible investor of an application for
              interests (the "Interests"), which will generally be accepted as
              of the first day of each month based on the Fund's estimated fair
              value, the Fund will issue new Interests. The Interests have not
              been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
              "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state. The Fund
              issues Interests only in private placement transactions in
              accordance with Regulation D or other applicable

                                       26                           (Continued)

                         THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                             (A Limited Partnership)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

              exemptions under the Securities Act. No public market exists for
              the Interests, and none is expected to develop. Since the
              Interests will not be listed on any securities exchange, the Fund
              is not required, and does not intend, to hold annual meetings of
              its partners. The Interests are subject to substantial
              restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
              transferred or resold except as permitted under the Fund's limited
              partnership agreement (the "LP Agreement"). The Fund reserves the
              right to reject any applications for Interests. The $4,860,573 in
              subscriptions received in advance as of June 30, 2004 represents
              subscriptions for Fund Interests received prior to the July 2004
              closing.

       (b)    ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

              For each fiscal period, net profits or net losses of the Fund are
              allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital
              accounts of all partners as of the last day of each fiscal period
              in accordance with the partners' respective investment percentages
              for the fiscal period. Net profits or net losses are measured as
              the net change in the value of the net assets of the Fund,
              including any net change in unrealized appreciation or
              depreciation of investments and income, net of expenses, and
              realized gains or losses during a fiscal period, before giving
              effect to any repurchases by the Fund of Interests or portions of
              Interests.

       (c)    REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS

              A partner will not be eligible to have the Fund repurchase all or
              any portion of an Interest at any time. The Adviser expects that
              it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase
              Interests each calendar quarter, beginning on or about December
              31, 2004 pursuant to written tenders by partners. The Board
              retains the sole discretion to accept or reject the recommendation
              of the Adviser. In the event Interests are redeemed, there will be
              a substantial period of time between the date as of which partners
              must accept the Fund's offer to repurchase their Interests and the
              date they can expect to receive payment for their Interests from
              the Fund.

(4)    INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

       As of June 30, 2004, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds,
       registered investment companies and marketable securities in a separately
       managed account, managed by a sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser"). The $2,022,911
       in pre-paid contribution to Investment Funds as of June 30, 2004
       represents funding of a portion of the July 2004 investment in such
       funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds or
       separately managed accounts provide for compensation to the Investment
       Funds' managers/general partners or advisors in the form of management
       fees ranging from 0.25% to 2.0% of net assets annually. In addition, many
       Investment Funds also provide for performance incentive fees/allocations
       ranging from 15% to 25% of an Investment Fund's net profits, although it
       is possible that such ranges may be exceeded for certain investment
       managers. These fees and incentive fees are in addition to the management
       fees charged by the Fund.

       The Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from
       monthly to annually with lock up provisions usually in the form of
       redemption fees for a period of up to four years. For the six months

                                       27                           (Continued)

                         THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                             (A Limited Partnership)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

       ended June 30, 2004, the aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from
       sales of portfolio securities were $127,837,630 and $19,475,628,
       respectively.

       The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
       items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from its investments. The
       allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by its investments on
       Schedules K-1 or 1099's. As of June 30, 2004, the cost of the Fund's
       investments was $204,037,691. Accordingly, net unrealized appreciation on
       investments was $13,600,026.

(5)    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

       In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
       invests trade various derivative securities and other financial
       instruments and enter into various investment activities with off-balance
       sheet risk. These activities may include, but are not limited to, short
       selling activities, writing option contracts interest rate swaps, futures
       contracts and options on futures, credit default swaps, use of leverage
       and total return equity swap contracts. The Fund's risk of loss in these
       Investment Funds is limited to the value of the investment in such
       Investment Funds as reported by the Fund.

(6)    DUE FROM BROKERS

       The Fund conducts business with various brokers for its investment
       activities. The clearing and depository operations for the investment
       activities are performed pursuant to agreements with the brokers. The
       Fund is subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom the
       Fund conducts business is unable to deliver cash balances or securities,
       or clear security transactions on the Fund's behalf. The Fund monitors
       the financial condition of the brokers with which the Fund conducts
       business and believes the likelihood of loss under the aforementioned
       circumstances is remote.

(7)    ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

       In consideration for administrative services, the Fund will pay the
       Independent Administrator a monthly administration fee (the
       "Administration Fee") based on the month end net assets of the Fund. The
       Administration Fee will equal 0.12% (on an annualized basis) of the
       Fund's month end net assets for the first $100 million of net assets, and
       0.08% (on an annualized basis) of the Fund's month end net assets for
       that portion of the Fund's net assets that exceeds $100 million. In
       addition, on a monthly basis, the Fund pays an annual fee of $7,500 for
       each separately managed account (up to four separately managed accounts),
       and $15,000 for each additional separately managed account. The assets in
       such separately managed accounts are not charged the asset-based fee, but
       are included in the total net assets of the Fund for the purposes of
       determining whether the $100 million breakpoint is reached. The
       Independent Administrator charges the Fund a minimum annual fee of
       $36,000. As of June 30, 2004, the Fund had $218,656,981 in net assets and
       one separately managed account. The Administration Fee will be paid to
       the Independent Administrator out of the Fund's assets, which will
       decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the partners in
       the Fund. The total Administration Fee incurred for the six months ended
       June 30, 2004 was $97,735. Citco and the Adviser have agreed to terminate
       the Fund's administrative agreement, effective October 13, 2004. The Fund
       is currently seeking a new independent administrator.

                                       28                           (Continued)

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 2004

(8)    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

       (a)    INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE

              In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by
              the Adviser to the Fund pursuant to the Investment Management
              Agreement, the Fund will pay the Adviser an investment management
              fee (the "Investment Management Fee"), equal to 1% on an
              annualized basis of the Fund's net assets calculated based on the
              Fund's net asset value at the end of each month, payable quarterly
              in arrears. The Investment Management Fee will decrease the net
              profits or increase the net losses of the Fund that are credited
              to or debited against the capital accounts of its limited
              partners. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, $855,024 was
              incurred for Investment Management Fees.

       (b)    PLACEMENT AGENTS

              The Fund may engage one or more placement agents (each, a
              "Placement Agent") to solicit investments in the Fund. Sanders
              Morris Harris, Inc. ("SMHI"), an affiliate of SMHG and the
              Adviser, has been engaged by the Fund to serve as a Placement
              Agent. SMHI is a full-service investment banking, broker-dealer,
              asset management and financial services organization. A Placement
              Agent may engage one or more sub-placement agents. The Adviser or
              its affiliates may pay a fee out of their own resources to
              Placement Agents and sub-placement agents.

(9)    INDEBTEDNESS OF THE FUND

              Pursuant to the Fund LP Agreement, the Fund may borrow up to, but
              not more than, 10% of net assets of the fund (at the time such
              borrowings were made and after taking into account the investment
              and/or deployment of such proceeds) for the purpose of making
              investments, funding redemptions and for other working capital and
              general Fund purposes. For purposes of the Fund's investment
              restrictions and certain investment limitations under the 1940
              Act, including for example, the Fund's leverage limitations, the
              Fund will not "look through" Investment Funds in which the Fund
              invests. Investment Funds may also use leverage, whether through
              borrowings, futures, or other derivative products and are not
              subject to the Fund's investment restrictions. However, such
              borrowings are without recourse to the Fund and the Fund's risk of
              loss is limited to its investment in such Investment Funds. The
              rights of any lenders to the Fund to receive payments of interest
              or repayments of principal will be senior to those of the
              partners, and the terms of any borrowings may contain provisions
              that limit certain activities of the Fund.

                                       29                           (Continued)

</Table>

       None of the above calculations have been annualized.

       (1) Ratios are calculated by dividing by average partners' capital
           measured at the beginning of the first month in the period and at the
           end of each month during the period.

       (2) Calculated as geometrically linked monthly returns for each month in
           the period. Monthly returns are calculated as net increase (decrease)
           in partners' capital resulting from operations for the month divided
           by opening partners' capital for the month. Opening partners' capital
           represents the balance of partners' capital at the beginning of the
           month, after taking into account contributions, allocations, and
           distributions.

       An investor's return (and operating ratios) may vary from those reflected
       based on different fee and expense arrangements and the timing of capital
       transactions.

(11)   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

       The Fund established a credit facility in July 2004 for which the
       investments of the Fund serve as collateral for the facility. The maximum
       amount that can be borrowed is based on the value of the underlying
       collateral; provided, however, that the Fund's fundamental policies
       provide that the Fund cannot borrow more than 10% of the value of the
       Fund's net assets. There are currently no amounts outstanding under such
       facility.

L.P.;
