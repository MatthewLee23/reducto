                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

The Advisor may also periodically provide additional information on Fund
performance on the Fund's webpage at http://www.ftportfolios.com.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment in
the Fund. It includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that
provide insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The material risks of investing in the
Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information,
this report and other Fund regulatory filings.

SHAREHOLDER LETTER

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                    ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
                                  MAY 31, 2017


Dear Shareholders:

First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") is pleased to provide you with this
annual report containing detailed information and the financial statements for
your investment in the First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II. We
encourage you to read this report and discuss it with your financial advisor.

Five months into the new year and under a new U.S. President, the stock market
has continued to rise. President Donald Trump's pro-growth, pro-U.S. policy
ideas have, in our opinion, created optimism about the U.S. economy. Indeed,
from Trump's election date (November 8, 2016) through May 31, 2017, the S&P
500(R) Index (the "Index") posted a total return of over 14%, according to
Bloomberg. While we are optimistic about the U.S. economy, we are also well
aware that no one can predict the future or know how a new administration will
affect markets and the economy. This is why we always stress the importance of
maintaining a long-term perspective, as we have done since First Trust's
inception over 25 years ago.

As of May 31, 2017, the Index was up 8.66% (calendar year-to-date). While the
current bull market (measuring from March 9, 2009 through May 31, 2017) is the
second longest in history, it is still behind (by just over 4 years) the longest
bull market, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

Thank you for giving First Trust the opportunity to be a part of your investment
plan. We value our relationship with you and will continue our relentless focus
on bringing you the types of investments that we believe could help you reach
your financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

James A. Bowen
Chairman of the Board of Trustees
Chief Executive Officer of First Trust Advisors L.P.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of senior secured floating-rate
loan interests ("senior loans"). There can be no assurance that the Fund's
investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

MARKET RECAP

The last twelve months ended May 31, 2017 (LTM) proved to be favorable within
the senior loan market, which experienced 12 consecutive months of positive
returns. The LTM total return for the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the
"Index") was 7.49%. This compares to 13.84% for the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch US High Yield Constrained Index and 17.47% for the S&P 500(R) Index over
the same time period. The resounding theme in the senior loan market has been
the strong demand for the asset class from investors, which in turn has resulted
in a wave of re-pricings and refinancings. In fact, of the $887.5 billion in
institutional loan issuance during the prior year period, 78.8%, or about $699.6
billion, was used for re-pricing and refinancing (JP Morgan). Investor demand
for the senior loan asset class has resulted in nearly $31.5 billion of inflows
over the prior year period (JP Morgan). The primary factor influencing this
demand has been the gradual increase in the Federal Funds Rate by the U.S.
Federal Reserve ("Fed"). More specifically, the Fed implemented two 25 basis
point ("bps") rate hikes in the Federal Funds Rate over the prior year to
100bps. This increase in the Federal Funds rate has also led to an increase in
3-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) from 69bps to 121bps. This trend
in LIBOR has partially mitigated the spread/yield reduction that resulted from
the recent repricing wave.

Senior Loan Markets

The Index returned 7.49% for the twelve-month period ending May 31, 2017.
Returns were strong for all credit quality issues with lower rated issues
outperforming. Lower quality CCC rated issues returned 25.93% in the period,
outperforming the 7.72% return for higher quality B rated issues and the 4.78%
return for even higher quality BB rated issues. The average bid price of loans
in the market began the period at $93.41 and ended the period at $98.33, while
the percent of loans in the Index bid at par and above increased from
approximately 30% to just inside of 70%. The discounted spread to a 3-year life
for the senior loan market began the period at LIBOR+573 and ended the period at
LIBOR+413, a tightening of 160bps.

The default rate within the Index continues to fall and remains well below the
long term average for senior loans. The LTM default rate within the Index ended
the period at 1.29%, which compares favorably to the long-term average default
rate of 3.05% dating back to January 1999. We believe the default rate remains
below the long-term average because overall corporate fundamentals remain
healthy and commodity prices have stabilized. Given the lack of near-term debt
maturities and favorable access to capital markets that companies are enjoying,
we believe the default rate for both senior loans and high-yield bonds will
remain relatively benign for some time.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund outperformed the Index on both a net asset value (NAV) and market value
basis for the trailing twelve-month period. The Fund generated a NAV return of
7.99% and a market price return of 10.89% while the Index generated a total
return of 7.49%. The Fund's discount to NAV ended the period 237bps tighter than
one year ago. At the start of the period, the Fund's market price was at a 6.99%
discount to NAV and narrowed to a 4.62% discount to NAV by the end of the
period.

PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY (CONTINUED)

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                 ANNUAL REPORT
                            MAY 31, 2017 (UNAUDITED)

Contributing to the Fund's outperformance relative to the Index over the period
was the Fund's use of leverage and issuer selection. The use of leverage
contributed positively as the total return of senior loans exceeded the
borrowing cost of leverage. Leverage on May 31, 2017, was approximately 27.7% of
managed assets.

From an income perspective, the monthly announced distribution rate began the
period at $0.07 per share and ended at $0.0663 per share. At the $0.0663 per
share monthly distribution rate, the annualized distribution rate on May 31,
2017 was 5.57% at NAV and 5.84% at market price.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

In our view, the positive backdrop for the senior loan and high-yield bond asset
classes continues to be the fact that the U.S. economy is on solid ground. We
believe that the proposed economic agenda under the Trump administration, which
includes lowering individual and corporate income tax rates, infrastructure
spending, and reduced regulatory burden on businesses has the potential to
accelerate the U.S. growth rate. While both the timing and the implementation of
the agenda in its entirety remain uncertain, it has buoyed risk markets up to
this point.

Credit markets appear well positioned for the intermediate term. We believe the
combination of strong technical tailwinds created by global central bank policy,
attractive valuations within the credit markets given the below-average default
rate environment, modest but healthy economic growth and sound corporate
fundamentals provides a firm backdrop for returns in the periods ahead.

We believe there are a number of potential interest rate catalysts on the
horizon. First, we believe the market is not fully pricing in the potential for
reflation in the U.S. Wage growth has increased and commodity prices have
stabilized / improved from the trough in February of 2016. Second, the narrative
from the Fed has been that short-term rates will continue to increase, and
discussions have intensified concerning the size of the Fed balance sheet and
how they might begin to shrink it. In our view, a decision to begin slowing the
reinvestment on the Fed balance sheet, taken in isolation, may send interest
rates higher; notwithstanding the potential for a more hawkish stance on rates
should inflation begin to increase at an even greater rate. Finally, we believe
that we are likely to see an overt tapering of the Quantitative Easing (QE)
program underway via the European Central Bank (ECB). In December, Mario Draghi,
President of the ECB, announced a covert tapering whereby the ECB trimmed
monthly bond purchases from $80 billion to $60 billion, but extended the length
of time in which QE would be in force. The market interpreted this as additional
stimulus, however, we believe this sets the table for an additional cut to their
QE program later this year. We also believe that if and when the ECB does in
fact pull back its QE, that it will lead to higher rates in Europe and would
likely carry through to the U.S. given the high correlation between German Bunds
and U.S. Treasury yields.

Based on current valuations (average price of $98.33 and spread of LIBOR+413),
we believe senior loans, given their senior secured position in the capital
structure, floating interest rate, high income and limited commodity exposure
(energy, metals and mining only comprise 4.10% of the senior loan Index on a
market value basis), are well positioned to deliver attractive risk adjusted
returns. Retail investors have begun to increase exposure to senior loans in the
wake of increasing Treasury yields and hawkish Fed rhetoric. We believe that
with further increases in the Federal Funds rate that we anticipate are on the
horizon, even if they occur at a modest pace, investors in senior loans are
likely to benefit.

In summary, we believe that both the senior loan and high-yield bond markets
currently offer compelling opportunities, and specifically within actively
managed strategies where return opportunities can be realized and risk can be
appropriately managed. We believe that investors may benefit from moving up the
corporate capital structure into senior loans and high-yield bonds to take
advantage of the attractive valuations and lower volatility relative to
equities.

As we evaluate new investment opportunities, decisions will continue to be
rooted in our rigorous bottom-up credit analysis and focus on the opportunities
that we believe offer the best risk and reward balance. Despite the many
distractions that ebb and flow every quarter, we remain firmly focused on
finding value in the high-yield bond and senior loan markets.

-----------------------------

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest at rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the
      prime rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the
      certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR
      floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown
      reflects the rate in effect at May 31, 2017. When a range of rates is
      disclosed, the Fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche
      at varying rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   On October 4, 2016, Arch Coal, Inc. completed a Bankruptcy Plan of
      Reorganization. In connection with the Plan of Reorganization, each lender
      received a portion of a new term loan equal to its closing date term loan
      percentage pursuant to the new credit agreement and a pro rata share of
      the newly issued common equity shares in the new company. The company also

      new entity, tax receivable rights and a beneficial interest in an

      buyers. Pursuant to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
      this security has been determined to be liquid by the Advisor. Although
      market instability can result in periods of increased overall market
      illiquidity, liquidity for each security is determined based on security
      specific factors and assumptions, which require subjective judgment. At

*     See the Portfolio of Investments for the industry breakout. Industry
      categories are only shown separately if they include holdings in two or
      more levels or have holdings in only Level 3.

**    Investment is valued at $0.


All transfers in and out of the Levels during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. There were no
transfers between Levels at May 31, 2017.

Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests and Rights that are fair valued by
the Advisor's Pricing Committee are footnoted in the Portfolio of Investments.
Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests are valued based on either
third-party pricing service prices obtained from dealer runs and indicative
sheets from brokers or are valued using broker quotes. The Level 3 Rights values
are based on unobservable and non-quantitative inputs. The Fund's Board of
Trustees has adopted valuation procedures that are utilized by the Advisor's
Pricing Committee to oversee the day-to-day valuation of the Fund's investments.
The Advisor's Pricing Committee, through the Fund's fund accounting agent,
monitors the daily pricing via tolerance checks and stale and unchanged price
reviews. The Advisor's Pricing Committee also reviews monthly back testing of
third-party pricing service prices by comparing sales prices of the Fund's
investments to prior day third-party pricing service prices. Additionally, the
Advisor's Pricing Committee reviews periodic information from the Fund's
third-party pricing service that compares secondary market trade prices to their
daily valuations.

-----------------------------

(a)   Amount is less than $0.01.

(b)   Total return is based on the combination of reinvested dividend, capital
      gain and return of capital distributions, if any, at prices obtained by
      the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, and changes in net asset value per share
      for net asset value returns and changes in Common Share Price for market
      value returns. Total returns do not reflect sales load and are not
      annualized for periods of less than one year. Past performance is not
      indicative of future results.

(c)   The variation in the portfolio turnover rate is due to a significant
      increase in the refinancing of the Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests
      held by the Fund during the year ended May 31, 2017.

(d)   Managed Assets are calculated by taking the Fund's total asset value,
      including assets attributable to the principal amount of borrowings, minus
      the sum of the Fund's liabilities, other than the principal amount of
      borrowings.

(e)   Calculated by taking the Fund's total assets less the Fund's total
      liabilities, not including the loan outstanding, and dividing by the
      outstanding loan balance in 000's.

Fund pursues these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of senior
secured floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans")(1). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Fund is considered an investment company and follows accounting and
reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 946, "Financial
Services-Investment Companies." The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its
financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The Fund's NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value. Market
value prices represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or
foreign exchange (i.e., a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from
third-party pricing services. Fair value prices represent any prices not
considered market value prices and are either obtained from a third-party
pricing service or are determined by the Pricing Committee of the Fund's
investment advisor, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust" or the "Advisor"),
in accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
and in accordance with provisions of the 1940 Act. Investments valued by the
Advisor's Pricing Committee, if any, are footnoted as such in the footnotes to
the Portfolio of Investments. The Fund's investments are valued as follows:

      The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
      securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought
      and sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private
      transactions that function in many respects like an over-the-counter
      secondary market, although typically no formal market-makers exist. This
      market, while having grown substantially since its inception, generally
      has fewer trades and less liquidity than the secondary market for other
      types of securities. Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade
      infrequently, and information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be
      widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the
      fair market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent and dated
      information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
      elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans
      than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are fair
      valued using information provided by a third-party pricing service. The
      third-party pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from
      dealer runs and broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior
      Loans. If the third-party pricing service cannot or does not provide a
      valuation for a particular Senior Loan or such valuation is deemed
      unreliable, the Advisor's Pricing Committee may value such Senior Loan at
      a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
      Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Fair
      valuation of a Senior Loan is based on the consideration of all available
      information, including, but not limited to the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;
      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;
      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;
      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;
      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;
      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;

      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.

                                  MAY 31, 2017


      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;
      8)    the coupon payments;
      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;
     10)    the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;
     11)    the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;
     12)    borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;
     13)    borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and
     14)    other relevant factors.

      Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or
      foreign exchange (excluding The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") and the
      London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are valued at
      the last sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded
      or, for Nasdaq and AIM securities, the official closing price. Securities
      traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale
      price or official closing price, as applicable, at the close of the
      securities exchange representing the principal market for such securities.

      Shares of open-end funds are valued at fair value which is based on NAV
      per share.

      Securities traded in an over-the-counter market are fair valued at the
      mean of their most recent bid and asked price, if available, and otherwise
      at their closing bid price.

      Corporate bonds, corporate notes and other debt securities are valued on
      the basis of valuations provided by dealers who make markets in such
      securities or by a third-party pricing service approved by the Fund's
      Board of Trustees, which may use the following valuation inputs when
      available:

      1)    benchmark yields;
      2)    reported trades;
      3)    broker/dealer quotes;
      4)    issuer spreads;
      5)    benchmark securities;
      6)    bids and offers; and
      7)    reference data including market research publications.

      Fixed-income and other debt securities having a remaining maturity of 60
      days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost adjusted for
      amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts (amortized cost),
      provided the Advisor's Pricing Committee has determined that the use of
      amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value given market and
      issuer-specific conditions existing at the time of the determination.
      Factors that may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the
      use of amortized cost include, but are not limited to, the following:

      1)    the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      2)    the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      3)    the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and changes
            thereto (such as significant changes in interest rates);
      4)    issuer-specific conditions (such as significant credit
            deterioration); and
      5)    any other market-based data the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            considers relevant. In this regard, the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            may use last-obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing
            portfolio securities using amortized cost.

Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate, the Advisor's Pricing Committee, at fair value. These securities
generally include, but are not limited to, restricted securities (securities
which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")) for which a third-party pricing service is
unable to provide a market price; securities whose trading has been formally
suspended; a security whose market or fair value price is not available from a
pre-established pricing source; a security with respect to which an event has
occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the security after the
market has closed but before the calculation of the Fund's NAV or make it
difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation; and a security
whose price, as provided by the third-party pricing service, does not reflect
the security's fair value. As a general principle, the current fair value of a
security would appear to be the amount which the owner might reasonably expect
to receive for the security upon its current sale. When fair value prices are
used, generally they will differ from market quotations or official closing
prices on the applicable exchanges. A variety of factors may be considered in
determining the fair value of such securities, including, but not limited to,
the following:

      1)    the type of security;
      2)    the size of the holding;
      3)    the initial cost of the security;

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2017


      4)    transactions in comparable securities;
      5)    price quotes from dealers and/or third-party pricing services;
      6)    relationships among various securities;
      7)    information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, or the
            appropriate stock exchange;
      8)    an analysis of the issuer's financial statements; and
      9)    the existence of merger proposals or tender offers that might affect
            the value of the security.

The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of May 31, 2017, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments as of May
31, 2017.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments,
which are marked to market daily, of $255,444 as of May 31, 2017. In connection
with these commitments, the Fund earns a commitment fee typically set as a
percentage of the commitment amount.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior
to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt
from registration under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified
institutional buyers. As of May 31, 2017, the Fund held restricted securities as
shown in the following table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that
such securities be registered. These securities are valued according to the
valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and
are not expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable
unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted investments with the same
maturity date and yield for this issuer.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2017


E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future. Permanent differences incurred during the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, resulting in book and tax accounting
differences, have been reclassified at year end to reflect an increase in
accumulated net investment income (loss) of $204,138, an increase in accumulated
net realized gain (loss) on investments of $25,372,255, and a decrease to
paid-in capital of $25,576,393. Net assets were not affected by these
reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2017 and 2016 was as follows:

Distributions paid from:                                2017            2016
                                                    ------------    ------------
Ordinary income.................................    $ 20,842,660    $ 23,493,344
Return of capital...............................       1,217,056              --

As of May 31, 2017, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income...................    $         --
Undistributed capital gains.....................              --
Total undistributed earnings....................              --
Accumulated capital and other losses............     (86,825,520)
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)......      (5,729,248)
                                                    ------------
Total accumulated earnings (losses).............     (92,554,768)

                                                    ------------
Net assets......................................    $381,297,725
                                                    ============

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal and state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010,
may be carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as
short-term and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried
forward for up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition
rule, the Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before
pre-enactment net capital losses. At May 31, 2017, for federal income tax
purposes, the Fund had capital loss carryforwards available that are shown in
the following table, to the extent provided by regulation, to offset future
capital gains through the years indicated. To the extent that these loss
carryforwards are used to offset future capital gains, it is probable that the
capital gains offset will not be distributed to the Fund shareholders.

</TABLE>

At the taxable year ended May 31, 2017, the Fund had $25,585,953 of
pre-enactment capital loss carryforwards that expired.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2017


Certain losses realized during the current fiscal year may be deferred and
treated as occurring the first day of the following fiscal year for federal
income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, the Fund incurred
and elected to defer net ordinary and capital losses as follows:

Qualified Late Year Losses:

Ordinary Losses     $           --
Capital Losses             486,914

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2014, 2015,
2016 and 2017 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2017,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

H. NEW AND AMENDED FINANCIAL RULES AND FORMS

On October 13, 2016, the SEC adopted new rules and forms, and amended existing
rules and forms. The new and amended rules and forms are intended to modernize
the reporting of information provided by funds and to improve the quality and
type of information that funds provide to the SEC and investors. The new and
amended rules and forms will be effective for the First Trust funds, including
the Fund, for reporting periods beginning on and after June 1, 2018. Management
is evaluating the new and amended rules and forms to determine the impact to the
Fund.

I. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In December 2016, FASB released Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-19 that
makes technical changes to various sections of the ASC, including Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurement. The changes to Topic 820 are intended to clarify the
difference between a valuation approach and a valuation technique. The changes
to ASC 820-10-50-2 require a reporting entity to disclose, for Level 2 and Level
3 fair value measurements, a change in either or both a valuation approach and a
valuation technique and the reason(s) for the change. The changes to Topic 820
are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2016. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of the ASU and has not yet determined its impact on the financial
statements and disclosures.

3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. The Charger Corporation is an Illinois corporation
controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First Trust. First
Trust is responsible for the selection and ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee
calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets (the average
daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's liabilities
other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also provides fund
reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNYM IS") serves as the Fund's
transfer agent in accordance with certain fee arrangements. As transfer agent,
BNYM IS is responsible for maintaining shareholder records for the Fund. The
Bank of New York Mellon ("BNYM") serves as the Fund's administrator, fund
accountant, and custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements. As
administrator and fund accountant, BNYM is responsible for providing certain
administrative and accounting services to the Fund, including maintaining the
Fund's books of account, records of the Fund's securities transactions, and
certain other books and records. As custodian, BNYM is responsible for custody
of the Fund's assets. BNYM IS and BNYM are subsidiaries of The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation, a financial holding company.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer that is allocated equally among each fund in the First Trust Fund
Complex. Each Independent Trustee is also paid an annual per fund fee that
varies based on whether the fund is a closed-end or other actively managed fund,
or is an index fund.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee and the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee are paid
annual fees to serve in such capacities, with such compensation allocated pro
rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.
Independent Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and Committee
Chairmen rotate every three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive
no compensation from the Fund for acting in such capacities.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

The cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding
short-term investments, for the year ended May 31, 2017, were $639,584,875 and
$623,279,625, respectively.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2017


                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Facility")
with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as
secondary lender and agent for the secured parties under the agreement. The
Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the terms of the
Credit Facility, the loans under the Credit Facility bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
conduit lender. Effective July 8, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended, whereby
the expiration date of the Credit Facility was extended until July 7, 2017 and
the total commitment was reduced from $180,000,000 to $170,000,000. The Credit
Facility may be renewed annually. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the
Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of at
least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The Fund pays
a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.3625% of the daily average of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances during the prior calendar
month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i) 0.3625% of
the daily average of the total commitment in effect (or if terminated, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances funded or maintained)
during the preceding calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

For the year ended May 31, 2017, the average amount outstanding under the Credit
Facility was $158,013,699. As of May 31, 2017, the Fund had outstanding
borrowings of $146,000,000. The high and low annual interest rates for the loan
under the Credit Facility funded by the conduit lender during the year ended May
31, 2017, were 1.21% and 0.70%, respectively, with a weighted average interest
rate of 0.97%. The annual interest rate in effect for the loan at May 31, 2017,
was 1.21%.

                               6. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                                 7. LITIGATION

The Fund has been named as a defendant in litigation pending in the Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York as part of the General Motors
bankruptcy case. The plaintiff, the Motors Liquidation Company Avoidance Action
Trust, is an entity formed under the bankruptcy plan of reorganization to
prosecute "avoidance" actions such as preference actions. The lawsuit arises
from years of ancillary litigation concerning whether the former holders of a
term loan to General Motors ("GM"), for which JP Morgan acted as agent, lost
their lien on GM collateral when a Uniform Commercial Code release was
mistakenly filed terminating their interest in certain collateral securing the
term loan. On January 21, 2015, the federal appeals court in New York ruled that
the term lenders' collateral interest was, indeed, terminated.

By virtue of the federal appellate court's decision, all of the former holders
of the term loan, including the Fund, are now being sued in the bankruptcy court
in New York for the avoidance and return of certain payments they received both
before and after the GM bankruptcy filing. The bankruptcy court lawsuit is
premised on the assertion that the term lenders received payments on account of
their status as fully secured creditors when in fact they should not have
received the payments because they were not in fact secured.

The Fund was first served following the filing of the First Amended Complaint on
May 20, 2015. The payments which were received by the Fund in 2009 and which the
plaintiff seeks to recover from the Fund total $8,057,298.44. The Fund has
engaged counsel to assist with its defense of this matter. Based on the current
status of the litigation, the Fund cannot predict the outcome of the litigation
at this time or the impact to Fund net assets, if any.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

On July 7, 2017, the Fund's existing leverage facility expired and was replaced
with a leverage facility provided by The Bank of Nova Scotia. The new leverage
facility has a maximum commitment amount of $170,000,000 and a rolling 179-day
maturity.

On June 20, 2017, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.0663 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on July 6, 2017, payable July 17, 2017.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2017, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2017 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and agent banks; when replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2017, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2017 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

dividends" or "short-term capital from dividends," may not be subject to federal
income tax provided that the income was earned directly by such foreign
shareholders.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Fund may invest up to 100% of its Managed Assets
in lower grade debt securities, which may also be referred to as below
investment grade debt securities. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally lower
rated and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated securities,
their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are
affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree. High yield
securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than
securities with higher ratings. A reduction in an issuer's creditworthiness may
result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an issuer on the
interest and principal payments. The high yield securities in which the Fund
invests are not listed on a national securities exchange. Due to the smaller,
less liquid market for the high yield securities, the bid-offer spread on such
securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade securities and
the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete. In general,
high-yield securities may have a greater risk of default than other types of
securities.


                                                                         Page 29

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2017 (UNAUDITED)

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

LIQUIDITY RISK: The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. Although the resale, or
secondary market for Senior Loans is growing, it is currently limited. There is
no organized exchange or board of trade on which Senior Loans are traded.
Instead, the secondary market for Senior Loans is an unregulated inter-dealer or
inter-bank resale market. In addition, Senior Loans in which the Fund invests
may require the consent of the borrower and/or agent prior to the settlement of
the sale or assignment. These consent requirements can delay or impede the
Fund's ability to settle the sale of Senior Loans. If the economy experiences a
sudden downturn, or if the market for the Senior Loans in which the Fund invests
becomes distressed, the Fund may have difficulty disposing of Senior Loans if it
needs cash to repay debt, to pay dividends, to pay expenses or to take advantage
of new investment opportunities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK: Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES RISK: Investments in restricted securities could have the
effect of increasing the amount of the Fund's assets invested in illiquid
securities if qualified institutional buyers are willing to purchase these
securities. Illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to dispose of at
the price at which the Fund has valued the securities and at the times when the
Fund believes it is desirable to do so. The market price of illiquid and
restricted securities generally is more volatile than that of more liquid
securities, which may adversely affect the price that the Fund recovers upon the
sale of such securities. Investment of the Fund's assets in illiquid and
restricted securities may restrict the Fund's ability to take advantage of
market opportunities.

SECOND LIEN LOAN RISK: A second lien loan may have a claim on the same
collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of
assets. Second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security
interest or lien to or on specified collateral securing the Borrower's
obligation under the interest. Because second lien loans are second to first
lien loans, they present a greater degree of investment risk. Specifically,
these loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the
Borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled
payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority. In addition,
loans that have a lower than first lien priority on collateral of the Borrower
generally have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority
and may be less liquid. However, second lien loans often pay interest at higher
rates than first lien loans reflecting such additional risks.

Second lien loans generally give investors priority over general unsecured
creditors in the event of an asset sale. The priority of the collateral claims
of third or lower lien loans ranks below holders of second lien loans and so on.
Such junior loans are subject to the same general risks inherent to any loan
investment, including credit risk, market and liquidity risk, and interest rate
risk. Due to their lower place in the borrower's capital structure and possible
unsecured or partially secured status, such loans involve a higher degree of

                            MAY 31, 2017 (UNAUDITED)

overall risk than first lien loans, since cash flow of the Borrower and property
securing the loan, if any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after
giving effect to higher priority secured obligations of the Borrower. Second
lien loans also share the same risks of other below investment grade debt
instruments (which are commonly referred to as "junk" or "high yield"
securities). See "Risks -- Credit Risk."

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with
statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $70,000 for 2016 and
$70,000 for 2017.

      (b) AUDIT-RELATED FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years, for assurance and related services by the
principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported under paragraph
(a) of this Item were $0 for 2016 and $92 for 2017.

      AUDIT-RELATED FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for assurance and related
services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the
performance of the audit of the Registrant's financial statements and are not
reported under paragraph (a) of this Item were $0 for 2016 and $0 for 2017.

      (c) TAX FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the last
two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant
for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the registrant were $5,200

preparation.

      TAX FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the

the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the
registrant's adviser were $0 for 2016 and $0 for 2017.

      (d) ALL OTHER FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of
the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the registrant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a)

      ALL OTHER FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the Registrant's investment adviser, other than services reported
in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2016 and $0 for 2017.

      (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

      Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

      The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.

      (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser of this
Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the pre-approval
exceptions included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                          (b)  0%
                          (c)  0%
                          (d)  0%

      (f) The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the
principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees was less than fifty
percent.

      (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's investment
adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio
management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),
and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2016 were $5,200 for the Registrant and $14,300 for the
Registrant's investment adviser and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 were
$5,200 for the Registrant and $44,400 for the Registrant's investment adviser.

      (h) The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant
that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

      consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The members

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. The First Trust Leveraged Finance Team
adheres to its trade allocation policy utilizing a pro-rata methodology to
address this conflict.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations.

In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the Code of Ethics
and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the Leveraged Finance
Team currently are prohibited from buying or selling equity securities
(including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and futures) and
corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over which they
exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Team are also prohibited
from engaging in any personal transaction while in possession of material
non-public information regarding the security or the issuer of the security.
First Trust and FTP also maintain a restricted list of all issuers for which the
First Trust Advisors L.P. Leveraged Finance Team has material non-public
information in its possession and all transactions executed for a product
advised or supervised by First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the
restricted list.

(A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

INFORMATION PROVIDED AS OF MAY 31, 2016

The compensation structure for the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust is based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.

                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
