       Senior Loan Fund performed during the semiannual period. The portfolio
       management team will provide an overview of the market conditions and

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment
       objective. The fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and
principal value will fluctuate and fund shares, when tendered, may be worth more
or less than their original cost.

As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the
figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or
speak with your financial advisor. Average annual total return assumes
reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains and excludes payment of maximum
early withdrawal charge. An early withdrawal charge for Class B shares of 3.00%
will be imposed on most shares accepted by the fund for repurchase within the
first year after purchase and declining thereafter to 0.00% after the fifth
year. An early withdrawal charge for Class C shares of 1.00% will be imposed on
most shares accepted by the fund for repurchase, which have been held for less
than one year.

Fund Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2004

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund is managed by the adviser's Senior Loans team, led
by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The six months ended January 31, 2004 were highly favorable for the senior-loan
market. Corporations continued to exhibit strong financial performance, with
marked improvement in balance sheets across most industries. In spite of limited
top-line revenue growth, companies were generally able to reap the benefits of
rising productivity, lower operating costs and low interest rates to boost
profitability. Market leaders were typically those companies that had
proactively restructured their businesses to thrive in an era of lower prices
and greater global competition.

These positive financial results formed the backdrop for a period of strong
performance in both the senior-loan market and its sibling, the high-yield
market. Yield spreads contracted over much of the period, which enabled many
companies to access the senior-loan market at the best terms since 1999. The
market was further boosted by an increase in demand, much of which came from
institutional investors drawn to the attractive yields and improving credit
quality. This was especially evident in the last two months of the period, when
investors began accepting issuance from companies with slightly higher debt
ratios than had previously been the case. The surge of interest in the asset
class led to the easy absorption of the healthy supply of new issuance during
the period.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 8.03 percent for the six months ended January 31, 2004. This
return is for Class B shares, assumes the reinvestment of all distributions, but
does not reflect the deduction of any applicable early withdrawal charges. If
these charges were included, performance would be lower. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. See Performance Summary for additional information.

TOTAL RETURN FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2004

<S>      <C>

8.03%              7.83%
- -----------------------------------
</Table>

The performance for the two share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.

We remained focused on maintaining a high level of diversification in the fund's
portfolio during the period in order to minimize the risk of over-concentration
in any one sector or security. While we follow a bottom-up security-selection
process and generally do not practice sector rotation, we did move to limit the
portfolio's exposure to certain industries facing ongoing challenges. For
example, we found the textile industry particularly unappealing given the
growing occurrence of import substitution, and we limited the fund's holdings in
this sector. We avoided the auto industry because we believe that with the
industry's continuing re-structuring, weaknesses may become evident throughout
the supply chain. We followed a similar path in telecommunications, where
ongoing problems with overcapacity have yet to be resolved.

Through thorough fundamental research, we identified issuers in several sectors
that offered what we believed to be compelling value relative to our assessment
of their financial prospects. Within the cable industry, for example, prices
remained depressed throughout much of the period in the wake of the Adelphia
reorganization. Our analysis indicated that the market was not properly pricing
the underlying strength of the cable business model. By investing in the
companies' senior secured debt, we were able to capitalize on these pricing
opportunities from a somewhat protected standpoint, relative to investors in
traditional high-yield bonds.

The number of issuers in the portfolio that are in default (defined here as
those not paying principal and/or interest as contractually obligated) has
declined by approximately 18 percent since the beginning of the period. The
process of working out previous defaults had left the portfolio with equity
holdings in several companies. We took advantage of rising prices over the
course of the period to sell several of these holdings and reinvested the
proceeds into interest-bearing notes.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade.

(1) Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(b) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(c) This borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(d) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(e) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(f) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2004.

(g) Non-income producing security as this stock currently does not declare
    dividends.

(h) Restricted security.

(i) A portion of this security is segregated in connection with unfunded loan
    commitments.

(k) Payment-in-kind security.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

January 31, 2004 (Unaudited)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans.
Senior Loans are business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made
to borrowers that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These
borrowers operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund
commenced investment operations on October 4, 1989. In June 2003, the Fund
completed a transaction in which it redesignated its shares issued before June
13, 2003 as Class B Shares and issued new Class C Shares to the shareholders of
Van Kampen Senior Floating Rate Fund in exchange for the assets and liabilities
of that fund. Effective November 30, 2003, the Fund's investment adviser, Van
Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. merged into Van Kampen Asset Management.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans are valued by the Fund following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Fund's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate redetermination period and
maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the
period until the next interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such
Senior Loans. Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial
paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate
securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the
Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by
the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase

                                                                              31

agreements, which are short-term investments in which the Fund acquires
ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the security at
a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for service
fees, which are applicable only to Class C shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2003, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $727,526,397, which will expire between July 31, 2004 and
July 31, 2011. Of this amount, $3,643,444 will expire on July 31, 2004.

    At January 31, 2004, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

                                                                              37

maintain with its custodian short-term investments having an aggregate value at
least equal to the amount of unfunded loan commitments.

    The Fund has entered into a revolving credit agreement for an aggregate of
$300,000,000, which will terminate on November 12, 2004. The proceeds of any
borrowing by the Fund under the revolving credit agreement shall be used for
temporary liquidity purposes and funding of shareholder tender offers. Annual
commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of the credit line.
For the six months ended January 31, 2004, the Fund recognized commitment fee
expenses of approximately $287,600. Borrowings under this facility will bear
interest at the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At January 31, 2004, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation
basis.
