LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

[PHOTO]
R. Jay Gerken

R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

The high-yield bond market generated a stellar return over the 12 months ended
April 30, 2004, spurred by an improving economy, which benefited from a
mid-year cut in interest rates. The rally came to a temporary halt in the
summer of 2003 due to a sharp sell-off in the bond market amid interest rate
concerns, but the market resumed course and advanced in the autumn as prices of
U.S. Treasuries stabilized. Although the market's tone was more tempered in the
first four months of 2004 compared to earlier in the fiscal year, as of the
period's close, corporate fundamentals remained strong and yields on high-yield
issues finished significantly above those on higher-rated bonds.

Strong inflows into high-yield bond funds throughout much of the fund's fiscal
year drove demand for high-yield bonds as fund managers deployed the assets,
propelling the market higher. Better-than-expected quarterly earnings and lower
default rates also contributed to this strong demand, while increased capital
market transactions fortified the balance sheets of corporate bond issuers.
Please note that high-yield bonds are subject to additional risks compared with
investment-grade bonds, such as the increased risk of default and greater
volatility because of the lower credit quality of these issues.

Emerging markets debt, as represented by the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond
Index Plus ("EMBI+")/i/, returned 9.50% for the 12-month period. The year was
made up of ten very strong months followed by a volatile two-month technical
sell-off in March and April 2004. The positive macro environment over the first
ten months was supportive of improving credit quality across the emerging
markets, which, when combined with continued progress on political and economic
reforms in many Latin American countries, encouraged broader investor
participation in emerging markets debt during this time. In addition, the
improving credit quality of the market may have caused some investors to change
their allocation approach to emerging markets from tactical to strategic,
further strengthening technical support for the market.

Please read on for a more detailed look at prevailing economic and market
conditions during the fund's fiscal year and to learn how those conditions and
changes made to the portfolio during this time may have affected fund
performance.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests
and investigations.

MANAGER OVERVIEW

Performance Review

During the 12 months ended April 30, 2004, the fund returned 13.51%, based on
its New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") market price and 19.99% based on its net
asset value ("NAV")/ii/ per share. In comparison, its benchmark, the unmanaged
Citigroup High-Yield Market Index,/iii/ returned 14.84% and its Lipper high
current yield (leveraged) closed-end funds category average returned 23.49%
over the same timeframe./iv/ Please note that Lipper performance returns are
based on each fund's NAV.

During the 12-month period, the fund distributed dividends to shareholders
totaling $1.38 per share. The performance table shows the fund's 30-day SEC
yield and its 12-month total return based on its NAV and market price as of
April 30, 2004. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund's
yields will vary.

</TABLE>

  All figures represent past performance and are not a guarantee of future
  results. The fund's yields will vary.
  Total returns are based on changes in NAV or market price, respectively.
  Total returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
  distributions, if any, in additional shares. The "SEC yield" is a return
  figure often quoted by bond and other fixed income mutual funds. This
  quotation is based on the most recent 30-day (or one month) period covered by
  the fund's filings with the SEC. The yield figure reflects the dividends and
  interest earned during the period after deduction of the fund's expenses for
  the period. These yields are as of April 30, 2004 and are subject to change.

Factors Driving the High-Yield Market Rally

Earlier last year, the high-yield market/v/ benefited from strong investor
demand for these securities, as evidenced by large inflows of capital into
high-yield mutual funds. The demand was driven by declining default rates and
more attractive yields on high-yield issues versus their investment-grade
counterparts.

The end of major combat in Iraq last year, reports that many companies had
generated first-quarter earnings in line with estimates and expectations in May
that the Fed would likely cut its short-term interest rate targets, all helped
buoy high-yield securities through mid-June. In order to help stimulate the
U.S. economy, the Fed cut its target for short-term interest rates in June to
its lowest level since the Eisenhower Administration. However, after advancing
for eight consecutive months, the high-yield market declined considerably in
July and early August due to the sharp sell-off in U.S. bond markets sparked by
signs of a strengthening economy, leading bond investors to bet that the Fed's
accommodative stance has come to an end and interest rates would soon be on the
rise.

High-Yield Rally Resumes

During the autumn, the high-yield market regained some of the momentum it lost
over the summer. Through much of the reporting period, the high-yield market
advanced amid record inflows into high-yield funds. Fundamentals also supported
the market as many companies generated better-than-expected earnings and
default rates continued to decline substantially compared to 2002.
Additionally, increased capital market transactions fortified the balance
sheets of corporate bond issuers in the healthier economic environment.

Except for the summer pullback last year, high-yield issues experienced
positive performance during most of 2003. That began to change in early 2004 as
signs of economic recovery increased and statements by the Fed indicated that
the central bank might begin raising interest rates sooner than anticipated.

The high-yield market continued to decline in February with lower-quality
issues leading the way down amid large fund outflows, continued profit taking
and greater scrutiny of company fundamentals. However, economic data released
in April showing an improving labor market and signs of higher inflation,
sparked another sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds as investors shifted their
expectations of Fed tightening from 2005 to the summer of 2004.

Emerging Markets Debt

Emerging markets debt returned 9.50% for the 12 months as measured by the EMBI+
index. The rally led to a dwindling of the gap, or spread,/vi/ between the
yield of emerging markets debt versus U.S. Treasury bonds. The spread declined
by almost one percentage point, with emerging debt ending the period yielding
4.78% more than Treasuries. The year consisted of ten very strong months
followed by a volatile two-month, technical sell-off in March and April 2004.
The positive macro environment for most of the year has been supportive of
improving credit quality across the emerging markets, which when combined with
continued progress on political and economic reforms in many Latin American
countries, encouraged broader investor participation in emerging markets debt.
In addition, the improving credit quality of the market may have caused some
investors to change their allocation approach to emerging markets from tactical
to strategic, further strengthening technical support for the market.

An increasingly stable U.S. economy also contributed to the emerging market
rally. Concerns about the economic impact of the war in Iraq were somewhat
unfounded as the U.S. economy steadily gained strength. The
quicker-than-anticipated resolution to these concerns, combined with higher
industrial productivity and stabilization in the unemployment rate, boosted
equity returns in the U.S., further contributing to a positive investment
environment in emerging markets. A stable U.S. economy is generally positive
for emerging market economies, many of which are export-oriented and dependent
on the U.S. as the world's growth engine.

The rally in emerging markets was generally supported by positive returns in
the U.S. Treasury bond market in 2003. In July, U.S. Treasury bond prices
plummeted following a report stating that economic growth sharply accelerated,
which prompted investors to question if the Fed's rate-cutting cycle had run
its course. Accordingly, the rally in emerging markets was temporarily halted
in July and resumed at a less torrid pace during the rest of the year.
Investors were encouraged by the relative stability of emerging market spreads
during this volatile Treasury market. During the month of July, when the U.S.
Treasury ten-year note declined 7.17%, spreads on the EMBI+ actually tightened
by 15 basis points./vii/ In other periods of comparable Treasury volatility,
emerging markets have experienced dramatic spread widening.

Low interest rates created a favorable environment for all emerging economies
and had been a key factor to the technical strength in the market, encouraging
investors to assume credit risk by focusing on

higher-yielding securities. These technicals turned around in the month of
March after a very strong U.S. employment number and fears of inflation caused
U.S. interest rates to move sharply higher. While, emerging market debt
fundamentals remained strong, sellers sold the asset class in an attempt to
decrease overall interest rate and credit risk. Another strong job report in
April only exacerbated this trend. The EMBI+ fell 6.1% from its March 19th peak
to the end of the period on April 30 dampening returns for the year.

Factors Influencing Fund Performance

As for the U.S. high-yield sector, the top-performing areas for the year
included aerospace, airlines, automotive, cable, communication towers, and
consumer products. The aerospace sector rallied as demand stabilized and
companies aggressively reduced costs. During the period, airlines recovered as
some companies avoided bankruptcy by renegotiating union contracts and
experiencing better-than-expected traffic volume following the resolution of
the major combat in Iraq. The automotive sector benefited from continued
strength in auto sales and better-than-expected earnings. The cable sector
outperformed many others as Charter Communications LLC, whose bonds had been
under pressure following an accounting investigation at the firm, rebounded
when the communications company reached an agreement with its banks to amend
its credit facilities and issued additional long-term debt to replace
short-term debt and improve liquidity. The communications towers sector
benefited from better-than-expected earnings results, asset sales, new
financing, and increasing free cash flow. Consumer Products outperformed, as
Revlon completed debt-for-equity exchanges to improve its balance sheet.

The most significant underperforming sectors included broadcast/outdoor,
publishing, satellites, and textiles. Despite having generated positive
performance, broadcast/outdoor, publishing, and satellites underperformed many
others due to their lower yields and limited price appreciation potential.

The portfolio benefited from overweighting in the cable, communications towers,
and consumer products sectors and overweighting issues rated CCC. The
portfolio's overweighted exposure to the healthcare sector, and underweightings
in the airlines, automotive, and utilities sectors, detracted from the
portfolio's performance. We added to the fund's positions in issues rated CCC
and in the chemicals, healthcare, metals/mining, and utilities sectors and
reduced the fund's exposure to the gaming and telecommunications sectors.

Within the fund's emerging markets debt component, the fund performed
relatively well in the ten-month period of strong returns. The fund's
performance was positively impacted by its overweighted exposure to Brazilian
and Ecuadorian debt. The fund's underweighted position in Venezuelan and
Turkish debt detracted from its relative performance, as did its holdings in
higher-quality credit issues. Fund performance was also positively impacted by
the use of leverage./viii/ During the first quarter of 2004, we decreased our
allocation to emerging markets debt based on our forecast of increased
volatility in the emerging markets, and we increased the portfolio's defensive
posture. The performance of our remaining exposure to the emerging markets
suffered slightly due to our continuing overweights in Brazil and Ecuador,
which led the asset class' sell-off.

Especially in this environment of four decade-low money market yields,
higher-yielding bonds in U.S. and emerging markets may seem even more
appealing. Remember, however, that higher-yield bonds carry more credit risk
than investment-grade issues, and international issues are subject to economic,
political and currency risks.

RISKS:
Like any investment where there is risk loss, you may not be able to sell the
shares for the same amount that you purchased them. Investing in foreign
securities is subject to certain risks not associated with domestic investing,
such as currency fluctuations, and changes in political and economic
conditions. These risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets. High
yield bonds involve greater credit and liquidity risks than investment grade
bonds. The fund may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be
illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large
impact on fund performance. Leverage may magnify gains and increase losses in
the fund's portfolio.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual
amounts could differ from those estimates.

(a) SECURITIES VALUATION. In valuing the Fund's assets, all securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued (i) at the last sale
price prior to the time of determination if there were a sale on the date of
determination, (ii) at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices
if there were no sales on such date and bid and asked quotations are available,
and (iii) at the bid price if there were no sales price on such date and only
bid quotations are available. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the last current bid and asked price as of
the close of business of that market. However, when the spread between bid and
asked price exceeds five percent of the par value of the security, the security
is valued at the bid price. Securities may also be valued by independent
pricing services which use prices provided by market-makers or estimates of
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities
with similar characteristics. Short-term investments having a maturity of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.
Securities for which reliable quotations are not readily available and all
other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade
date. Interest income is accrued on a daily basis. Market discount or premium
on securities purchased is accreted or amortized, respectively, on an effective
yield basis over the life of the security. The Fund uses the specific
identification method for determining realized gain or loss on investments.
Dividend income is recorded on ex-dividend date.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Fund has complied and intends to continue to
comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated

                                                                        Page 27

investment companies, and to distribute all of its income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax or excise tax provision is required. The
character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance
with income tax regulations which may differ from U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund declares and pays dividends to
shareholders monthly from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, in
excess of loss carryovers are expected to be distributed at least annually.
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the components of net
assets.

(e) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the
Fund's policy that a custodian takes possession of the underlying collateral
securities, the value of which at least equals the principal amount of the
repurchase transaction, including accrued interest. To the extent that any
repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is
marked-to-market to ensure the adequacy of the collateral. If the seller
defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings
are commenced with respect to the seller of the security, realization of the
collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

(f) CASH FLOW INFORMATION. The Fund invests in securities and distributes
dividends from net investment income and net realized gains which are paid in
cash and may be reinvested at the discretion of shareholders. These activities
are reported in the statement of changes in net assets and additional
information on cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement
of cash flows.

(g) YEAR END TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. The character of income and gains to be
distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. At April 30, 2004,
reclassifications were made to the capital accounts of the Fund to reflect
permanent book/tax differences and income and gains available for distributions
under income tax regulations. Accordingly, a portion of overdistributed net
investment income amounting to $19,736,002 was reclassified to paid-in-capital.
Net investment income, net realized gains and net assets were not affected by
this change.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc ("Investment Manager"), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment
manager to the Fund. The Investment Manager is responsible on a day-to-day
basis for the management of the Fund's portfolio in accordance with the Fund's
investment objectives and policies and for making

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

decisions to buy, sell or hold particular securities of the Fund. The
management fee for these services is payable monthly at an annual rate of 1.00%
of the Fund's average weekly net assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding
borrowings used for leverage.

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("Administrator"), another indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, acts as the Fund's administrator for
which the Fund pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.10% of the value of
the Fund's average weekly net assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding
borrowings used for leverage. The administrator performs certain administrative
services necessary for the operation of the Fund.

During periods in which the Fund is utilizing financial leverage, the fees
which are payable to the Investment Manager and Administrator as a percentage
of the Fund's assets will be higher than if the Fund did not utilize leverage
because the fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund's assets, including
those investments purchased with leverage.

At April 30, 2004, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), another indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, held 12.338 shares of the Fund.

Certain officers and/or Directors of the Fund are also officers and/or
Directors of the Investment Manager.

NOTE 3. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

During the year ended April 30, 2004, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

At April 30, 2004, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation
of investments for Federal income tax purposes were as follows:

NOTE 4. LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian whereby the custodian may lend
securities owned by the Fund to brokers, dealers and other financial
organizations, and receives a lenders fee. Fees earned by the Fund on
securities lending are recorded in interest income. Loans of securities by the
Fund are collateralized by cash, U.S. government securities or high quality

                                                                        Page 29

SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

money market instruments that are maintained at all times in an amount at least
equal to the current market value of the securities loaned, plus a margin which
may vary depending on the type of securities loaned. The Fund maintains
exposure for the risk of any losses in the investment of amounts received as
collateral.

At April 30, 2004, the Fund loaned securities having a market value of
$201,273,072. The Fund received cash collateral amounting to $205,684,415 which
was invested into the State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust Prime
Portfolio.

Income earned by the Fund from securities lending for the year ended April 30,
2004 was $308,136.

NOTE 5. LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

The Fund invests in fixed and floating rate loans arranged through private
negotiations between a foreign sovereign entity and one or more financial
institutions. The Fund's investment in any such loan may be in the form of a
participation in or an assignment of the loan.

In connection with purchasing participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan
agreement relating to the loan, nor any rights of set-off against the borrower,
and the Fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan
in which it has purchased the participation. As a result, the Fund will assume
the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender that is selling the
participation. In the event of the insolvency of the lender selling the
participation, the Fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and
may not benefit from any set-off between the lender and the borrower.

At April 30, 2004, the Fund held loan participations with a total cost of
$5,012,196.

NOTE 6. CREDIT AND MARKET RISK

The yields of emerging markets debt obligations and high-yield corporate debt
obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's
investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks
not associated with higher rated securities including, among others, overall
greater risk of timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater
market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading. The
consequences of political, social, economic or diplomatic changes may have
disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the Fund.

NOTE 7. LOAN

At April 30, 2004, the Fund had outstanding a $300,000,000 loan pursuant to a
revolving credit and security agreement with CXC Inc., an affiliate of
Citigroup, a commercial paper conduit issuer for which Citicorp North America
Inc., an affiliate of the Investment Manager, acts as

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

administrative agent. The average balance outstanding on the loan for the year
ended April 30, 2004 was $300,000,000. The loans generally bear interest at a
variable rate based on the weighted average interest rates of the underlying
commercial paper or LIBOR, plus any applicable margin. Securities held by the
Fund are subject to a lien, granted to the lenders, to the extent of the
borrowing outstanding and any additional expenses. For the year ended April 30,
2004, the weighted average interest rate of the loan was 1.64%. The interest
expense of the Fund was $4,964,365.

NOTE 8. DIVIDENDS SUBSEQUENT TO APRIL 30,  2004

On February 9, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund declared dividends in
the amount of $0.115 per share, payable on May 28, 2004 to shareholders of
record on May 18, 2004.

On May 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund declared three dividends,
each in the amount of $0.115 per share, payable on June 25, 2004, July 30, 2004
and August 27, 2004 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2004, July 13, 2004
and August 17, 2004, respectively.

9. CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD

At April 30, 2004, the Fund had, for Federal income tax purposes, approximately
$223,976,000 of capital loss carryforwards available to offset future capital
gains. To the extent that these carryforward losses are used to offset capital
gains, it is probable that the gains so offset will not be distributed.
However, if current year distributions exceed the required distribution amount
as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, realized gains
that have been offset by the carryforward losses may be taxable to shareholders.

The amount and year of expiration for each carryforward loss is indicated
below. Expiration occurs on April 30 of the year indicated:

10. INCOME TAX INFORMATION AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The tax basis components of distributable earnings at April 30, 2004 were:

                                              =============
</TABLE>

The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation and
depreciation is attributable primarily to wash sale loss deferrals.

NOTE 11. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue
guarantee agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor
would guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue
Guarantee Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the
sub-contractor's business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent
(PFPC Inc.) used by CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee
Agreement was amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements
that included a one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards informed of
the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when that occurred.

CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
approximately $17 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received
from the Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. CAM also plans an
independent review to verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were
fairly priced as compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new
procedures and making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are
entered into in the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Salomon Brothers
High Income Fund II Inc. ("Fund") at April 30, 2004, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at April 30, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.



DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Pursuant to certain rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission the
following additional disclosure is provided.

Each shareholder purchasing shares of common stock ("Shares") of Salomon
Brothers High Income Fund II Inc. ("Fund") will be deemed to have elected to be
a participant in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), unless the
shareholder specifically elects in writing (addressed to the Agent at the
address below or to any nominee who holds Shares for the shareholder in its
name) to receive all income dividends and distributions of capital gains in
cash, paid by check, mailed directly to the record holder by or under the
direction of PFPC Inc. as the Fund's dividend-paying agent ("Agent"). A
shareholder whose Shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee who does
not provide an automatic reinvestment service may be required to take such
Shares out of "street name" and register such Shares in the shareholder's name
in order to participate, otherwise dividends and distributions will be paid in
cash to such shareholder by the broker or nominee. Each participant in the Plan
is referred to herein as a "Participant." The Agent will act as Agent for each
Participant, and will open accounts for each Participant under the Plan in the
same name as their Shares are registered.

Unless the Fund declares a dividend or distribution payable only in the form of
cash, the Agent will apply all dividends and distributions in the manner set
forth below.

If, on the determination date (as defined below), the market price per Share
equals or exceeds the net asset value per Share on that date (such condition, a
"market premium"), the Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in newly
issued Shares of the Fund on behalf of Participants. If, on the determination
date, the net asset value per Share exceeds the market price per Share (such
condition, a "market discount"), the Agent will purchase Shares in the open
market. The determination date will be the fourth New York Stock Exchange
trading day (a New York Stock Exchange trading day being referred to herein as
a "Trading Day") preceding the payment date for the dividend or distribution.
For purposes herein, "market price" will mean the average of the highest and
lowest prices at which the Shares sell on the New York Stock Exchange on the
particular date, or if there is no sale on that date, the average of the
closing bid and asked quotations.

Purchases made by the Agent will be made as soon as practicable commencing on
the Trading Day following the determination date and terminating no later than
30 days after the dividend or distribution payment date except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities law; provided, however, that such purchases
will, in any event, terminate on the Trading Day prior to the "ex-dividend"
date next succeeding the dividend or distribution payment date.

If (i) the Agent has not invested the full dividend amount in open market
purchases by the date specified at the bottom of the prior page as the date on
which such purchases must terminate or (ii) a market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, then the

                                                                        Page 39

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC.



DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

Agent will cease making open market purchases and will receive the uninvested
portion of the dividend amount in newly issued Shares (x) in the case of (i)
above, at the close of business on the date the Agent is required to terminate
making open market purchases as specified at the bottom of the prior page or
(y) in the case of (ii) above, at the close of business on the date such shift
occurs; but in no event prior to the payment date for the dividend or
distribution.

In the event that all or part of a dividend or distribution amount is to be
paid in newly issued Shares, such Shares will be issued to Participants in
accordance with the following formula: (i) if, on the valuation date, the net
asset value per share is less than or equal to the market price per Share, then
the newly issued Shares will be valued at net asset value per Share on the
valuation date provided, however, that if the net asset value is less than 95%
of the market price on the valuation date, then such Shares will be issued at
95% of the market price and (ii) if, on the valuation date, the net asset value
per share is greater than the market price per Share, then the newly issued
Shares will be issued at the market price on the valuation date. The valuation
date will be the dividend or distribution payment date, except that with
respect to Shares issued pursuant to the paragraph above, the valuation date
will be the date such Shares are issued. If a date that would otherwise be a
valuation date is not a Trading Day, the valuation date will be the next
preceding Trading Day.

The open market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities
exchange on which the Shares of the Fund are traded, in the over-the-counter
market or in negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price,
delivery and otherwise as the Agent shall determine. Funds held by the Agent
uninvested will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any event, the
Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability to purchase
Shares within the time periods herein provided, or with the timing of any
purchases effected. The Agent shall have no responsibility as to the value of
the Shares acquired for the Participant's account. The Agent may commingle
amounts of all Participants to be used for open market purchases of Shares and
the price per Share allocable to each Participant in connection with such
purchases shall be the average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
Shares purchased by the Agent.

The Agent will maintain all Participant accounts in the Plan and will furnish
written confirmations of all transactions in each account, including
information needed by Participants for personal and tax records. The Agent will
hold Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan in noncertificated form in the
Participant's name or that of its nominee, and each Participant's proxy will
include those Shares purchased pursuant to the Plan. The Agent will forward to
Participants any proxy solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held
for Participants only in accordance with the proxy returned by Participants to
the Fund. Upon written request, the Agent will deliver to Participants, without
charge, a certificate or certificates for the full Shares.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)


The Agent will confirm to Participants each acquisition made for their
respective accounts as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the
date thereof. Although Participants may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share of the Fund,
no certificates for fractional shares will be issued. Dividends and
distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the
market value of the Fund's Shares at the time of termination less the pro rata
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any share dividends or split shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Agent for Participants will be credited to their respective accounts. In
the event that the Fund makes available to Participants rights to purchase
additional Shares or other securities, the Shares held for Participants under
the Plan will be added to other Shares held by the Participants in calculating
the number of rights to be issued to Participants.

The Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions on all open market purchases.

Participants may terminate their accounts under the Plan by notifying the Agent
in writing or by calling 1-800-331-1710. Such termination will be effective
immediately if notice is received by the Agent not less than ten days prior to
any dividend or distribution record date; otherwise such termination will be
effective on the first Trading Day after the payment due for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be amended or terminated by the Fund as applied to any dividend or capital
gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change or
termination sent to Participants at least 30 days prior to the record date for
the dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan may be amended or
terminated by the Agent, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30
days' written notice to Plan Participants. Notwithstanding the preceding two
sentences, the Agent or the Fund may amend or supplement the Plan at any time
or times when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or rules
or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory
authority. Upon any termination, the Agent will cause a certificate or
certificates for the full Shares held by each Participant under the Plan and
cash adjustment for any fraction to be delivered to each Participant without
charge. If the Participant elects by notice to the Agent in writing in advance
of such termination to have the Agent sell part or all of a Participant's
Shares and remit the proceeds to Participant, the Agent is authorized to deduct
a $2.50 fee plus brokerage commission for this transaction from the proceeds.

Any amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each Participant
unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent receives written notice
of the termination of the Participant's account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the

                                                                        Page 41

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

Agent in its place and stead of a successor Agent under these terms and
conditions, with full power and authority to perform all or any of the acts to
be performed by the Agent under these terms and conditions. Upon any such
appointment of an Agent for the purpose of receiving dividends and
distributions, the Fund will be authorized to pay to such successor Agent, for
each Participant's account, all dividends and distributions payable on Shares
of the Fund held in each Participant's name or under the Plan for retention or
application by such successor Agent as provided in these terms and conditions.

In the case of Participants, such as banks, broker-dealers or other nominees,
which hold Shares for others who are beneficial owners ("Nominee Holders"), the
Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Shares certified
from time to time by each Nominee Holder as representing the total amount
registered in the Nominee Holder's name and held for the account of beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and use its best efforts within
reasonable limits to insure the accuracy of all services performed under this
Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility and
shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by its negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of its
employees.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Agent at P.O.
Box 43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027.

TEM 4.          PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                (a) Audit Fees for Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc.
                    were $33,000 and $33,000 for the years ended 4/30/04 and

                    adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
                    primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
                    overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity
                    controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
                    investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
                    Salomon Brothers High Income Fund Inc. ("service
                    affiliates"), that were reasonably related to the
                    performance of the annual audit of the service affiliates.
                    Accordingly, there were no such fees that required

                    2003 to April 30, 2004 (prior to May 6, 2003 services
                    provided by the Accountant were not required to be
                    pre-approved).

                (c) Tax Fees for Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc. of

                    local income tax returns, timely RIC qualification review
                    and tax distribution and analysis planning) rendered by the
                    Accountant to Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc.

                    There were no fees billed for tax services by the
                    Accountants to service affiliates for the period May 6, 2003
                    through December 31, 2003 that required pre-approval by the
                    Audit Committee.

                (d) There were no All Other Fees for Salomon Brothers High
                    Income Fund II Inc. for the years ended 4/30/04 and 4/30/03.

                    All Other Fees. The aggregate fees billed for all other
                    non-audit services rendered by the Accountant to Salomon
                    Brothers Asset Management ("SBAM"), and any entity
                    controlling, controlled by or under common control with SBAM
                    that provided ongoing services to Salomon Brothers High
                    Income Fund Inc., requiring pre-approval by the Audit
                    Committee for the period May 6, 2003 through December 31,
                    2003, which included the issuance of reports on internal
                    control under SAS No. 70 relating to various Citigroup Asset
                    Management ("CAM") entities, were $558,750; all of which
                    were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

                (e) (1) Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
                    described in paragraph (c) (7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation
                    S-X. The Charter for the Audit Committee (the "Committee")
                    of the Board of each registered investment company (the
                    "Fund") advised by Smith Barney Fund Management LLC or
                    Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc. or one of their
                    affiliates (each, an "Adviser") requires that the Committee
                    shall approve (a) all audit and permissible non-audit
                    services to be provided to the Fund and (b) all permissible
                    non-audit services to be provided by the Fund's independent
                    auditors to the Adviser and any Covered Service Providers if
                    the engagement relates directly to the operations and
                    financial reporting of the Fund. The Committee may implement
                    policies and procedures by which such services are approved
                    other than by the full Committee.

                    The Committee shall not approve non-audit services that the
                    Committee believes may impair the independence of the
                    auditors. As of the date of the approval of this Audit
                    Committee Charter, permissible non-audit services include
                    any professional services (including tax services), that are
                    not prohibited services as described below, provided to the
                    Fund by the independent auditors, other than those provided
                    to the Fund in connection with an audit or a review of the
                    financial statements of the Fund. Permissible non-audit

                    to the Fund, the Adviser and any service providers
                    controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
                    Adviser that provide ongoing services to the Fund ("Covered
                    Service Providers") constitutes not more than 5% of the

                    services are provided to (a) the Fund, (b) the Adviser and

                    the Fund during the fiscal year in which the services are
                    provided that would have to be approved by the Committee;

                (g) Non-audit fees billed by the Accountant for services
                    rendered to Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc. and

                    common control with CAM that provides ongoing services to
                    Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc. were $18.3 million

                (h) Yes. The Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc.'s Audit
                    Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit
                    services that were rendered to Service Affiliates which were
                    not pre-approved (not requiring pre-approval) is compatible
                    with maintaining the Auditor's independence. All services
                    provided by the Accountant to the Salomon Brothers High
                    Income Fund II Inc. or to Service Affiliates which were
                    required to be pre-approved were pre-approved as required.



ITEM 5.         AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

                Not applicable.

ITEM 6.         [RESERVED]

ITEM 7.         DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
                CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority
                to develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to
                the Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management
                ("CAM"), a group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup,
                Inc. ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers
                that comprise CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting
                policies and procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the
                Manager votes proxies relating to equity securities in the best
                interest of clients.

                In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
                principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best
                interest of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all
                factors that could affect the value of the investment and will
                vote proxies in the manner that it believes will be consistent
                with efforts to maximize shareholder values. The Manager may
                utilize an external service provider to provide it with
                information and/or a recommendation with regard to proxy votes.
                However, such recommendations do not relieve the Manager of its
                responsibility for the proxy vote.

                In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated
                position in the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with
                such stated position. In the case of a proxy issue for which
                there is a list of factors set forth in the Policies that CAM
                considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case
                basis in accordance with the general principles set forth above
                and considering such enumerated factors. In the case of a proxy
                issue for which there is no stated

<PAGE>

                position or list of factors that CAM considers in voting on such
                issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the
                general principles set forth above. Issues for which there is a
                stated position set forth in the Policies or for which there is
                a list of factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers
                in voting on such issues fall into a variety of categories,
                including election of directors, ratification of auditors, proxy
                and tender offer defenses, capital structure issues, executive
                and director compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings,
                and social and environmental issues. The stated position on an
                issue set forth in the Policies can always be superseded,
                subject to the duty to act solely in the best interest of the
                beneficial owners of accounts, by the investment management
                professionals responsible for the account whose shares are being
                voted. Issues applicable to a particular industry may cause CAM
                to abandon a policy that would have otherwise applied to issuers
                generally. As a result of the independent investment advisory
                services provided by distinct CAM business units, there may be
                occasions when different business units or different portfolio
                managers within the same business unit vote differently on the
                same issue.

                In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
                interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
                identify and address material conflicts that may arise between
                the Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting
                proxies on behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts
                of interest, CAM periodically notifies CAM employees (including
                employees of the Manager) in writing that they are under an
                obligation (i) to be aware of the potential for conflicts of
                interest with respect to voting proxies on behalf of client
                accounts both as a result of their personal relationships and
                due to special circumstances that may arise during the conduct
                of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring conflicts
                of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
                compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a
                list of significant relationships that could present a conflict
                of interest for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is
                also sensitive to the fact that a significant, publicized
                relationship between an issuer and a non-CAM affiliate might
                appear to the public to influence the manner in which the
                Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such issuer.
                Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized
                non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for
                prudential reasons treats as a potential conflict of interest
                because such relationship might appear to the public to
                influence the manner in which the Manager decides to vote a
                proxy, the Manager generally takes the position that non-CAM
                relationships between Citigroup and an issuer (e.g. investment
                banking or banking) do not present a conflict of interest for
                the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer. Such
                position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
                independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as
                well as on the existence of information barriers between the
                Manager and certain other Citigroup business units.

                CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager
                personnel are members, to review and address conflicts of
                interest brought to its attention by compliance personnel. A
                proxy issue

<PAGE>

                that will be voted in accordance with a stated position on an
                issue or in accordance with the recommendation of an independent
                third party is not brought to the attention of the Proxy Voting
                Committee for a conflict of interest review because the
                Manager's position is that to the extent a conflict of interest
                issue exists, it is resolved by voting in accordance with a
                pre-determined policy or in accordance with the recommendation
                of an independent third party. With respect to a conflict of
                interest brought to its attention, the Proxy Voting Committee
                first determines whether such conflict of interest is material.
                A conflict of interest is considered material to the extent that
                it is determined that such conflict is likely to influence, or
                appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making in voting
                proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that
                a conflict of interest is not material, the Manager may vote
                proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

                If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a
                conflict of interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is
                responsible for determining an appropriate method to resolve
                such conflict of interest before the proxy affected by the
                conflict of interest is voted. Such determination is based on
                the particular facts and circumstances, including the importance
                of the proxy issue and the nature of the conflict of interest.
                Methods of resolving a material conflict of interest may
                include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict to
                clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting
                to clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on
                their behalf.

EX 99.CODE ETH

                        SARBANES-OXLEY ACT CODE OF ETHICS
                           FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
      SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF CAM/U.S. REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES

I.      COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

        This code of ethics (the "Code") for Citigroup Asset Management's
("CAM's") U. S. registered proprietary investment companies (collectively,
"Funds" and each a, "Company") applies to each Company's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller
(the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

     .  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
        apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
        relationships;

     .  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
        and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
        and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
        by the Company;

     .  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     .  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
        appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     .  accountability for adherence to the Code.

        Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.     ADMINISTRATION OF CODE

        The Regional Director of CAM Compliance, North America ("Compliance
Officer") is responsible for administration of this Code, including granting
pre-approvals (see Section III below) and waivers (as described in Section VI
below), applying this Code in specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and interpreting this Code in any particular situation.

<PAGE>

III.    COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD ETHICALLY HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
        OF INTEREST

        Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his position with the Company.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The compliance programs
and procedures of the Company and its investment adviser are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code (see Section VII
below).

        Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and a
Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of a Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Funds' Boards of Directors\Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may
also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered
by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

                       *          *          *          *

        Each Covered Officer must:

     .  not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
        influence investment decisions or financial reporting ( e.g. through
        fraudulent accounting

<PAGE>

        practices) by the Company whereby the Covered Officer/1/ would benefit
        personally to the detriment of the Company; or

     .  not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
        individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than for the
        benefit of the Company; and

     .  not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
        contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to
        trade personally in contemplation of the market affect of such
        transactions.

     .  There are some potential conflict of interest situations that should
        always be discussed with the Compliance Officer, if material. Examples
        are as follows:

                (1) service as a director on the board of any public or private
        company;

                (2) any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
        relationship with, any of the Company's service providers, other than
        its investment adviser,

                (3) a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
        transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
        portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
        interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
        compensation or equity ownership; and

                (4) the receipt of any gifts or the conveyance of any value
        (including entertainment ) from any company with which the Company has
        current or prospective business dealings, except:

                        (a) any non-cash gifts of nominal value (nominal value
                is less than $100); and

                        (b) customary and reasonable meals and entertainment at
                which the giver is present, such as the occasional business meal
                or sporting event.

IV.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

Each Covered Officer:

     .  should be familiar with his or her responsibilities in connection with
        the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company;

- ----------
/1/  Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
     Officer would also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
     of a Covered Officer's family (spouse, minor children and any account over
     which a Covered Officer is deemed to have beneficial interest) engages in
     such an activity or has such a relationship.

<PAGE>

     .  should not knowingly misrepresent, or knowingly cause others to
        misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
        outside the Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors,
        and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     .  should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
        responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds
        and the investment adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
        accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
        documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
        communications made by the Funds; and

     .  is responsible to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
        imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

        Each Covered Officer must:

     .  upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
        Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that the Covered
        Officer has received, read, and understands the Code;

     .  annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied with
        the requirements of the Code;

     .  annually disclose affiliations and other relationships related to
        conflicts of interest;

     .  not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
        Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
        that are made in good faith; and

     .  notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he knows of any violation of
        this Code (failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code).

        In rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting
investigations of potential violations under the Code, the Compliance Officer
may, at his discretion, consult with such persons as he determines to be
appropriate, including, but not limited to, a senior legal officer of the
Company or its investment adviser or its affiliates, independent auditors or
other consultants, subject to any requirement to seek pre-approval from the
Company's audit committee for the retention of independent auditors to perform
permissible non-audit services. The Funds will follow these procedures in
investigating and enforcing the Code:

     .  the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
        any potential violation of which he becomes aware;

     .  if, after investigation the Compliance Officer believes that no
        violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
        any further action;

<PAGE>

     .  any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
        reported to the Directors of the Fund who are not "interested persons"
        as defined in the Investment Company Act the ("Non-interested
        Directors")

     .  if the Non-interested Directors of the Board concur that a violation has
        occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include review
        of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and
        procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
        adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered
        Officer; and

     .  any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
        disclosed as provided by SEC rules

        The Compliance Officer shall submit an annual report to the Board
describing any waivers granted.

VI.     WAIVERS/2/

        A Covered Officer may request a waiver of any of the provisions of the
Code by submitting a written request for such waiver to the Compliance Officer,
setting forth the basis of such request and explaining how the waiver would be
consistent with the standards of conduct described herein. The Compliance
Officer shall review such request and make a determination thereon in writing,
which shall be binding.

        In determining whether to waive any provisions of this Code, the
Compliance Officer shall consider whether the proposed waiver is consistent with
honest and ethical conduct and other purposes of this Code.

VII.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code. The codes of ethics of the funds and the
investment advisers and principal underwriters under Rule 17j-1 of the
Investment Company Act and the Citigroup Code of Conduct and Citigroup Statement
of Business Practices as well as other policies of the Fund's investment
advisers or their affiliates are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

- ----------
/2/  For purposes of this Code, Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the
     approval by a Company of a material departure from a provision of the Code"
     and includes an "implicit waiver," which means a Company's failure to take
     action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure
     from a provision of the Code that has been made known to an executive
     officer of the Company.

<PAGE>

VIII.   AMENDMENTS

        Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B and
C must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a
majority of Non-interested Directors.

IX.     CONFIDENTIALITY

        All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board and Company
and their respective counsel, counsel to the non-Interested Directors or
independent auditors or other consultants referred to in Section V above.

X.      INTERNAL USE

        The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
