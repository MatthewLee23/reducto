Dear Fellow Shareholders,

After advancing for a second straight year in 2004, the stock market
pulled back in the first four months of 2005. For much of 2004 the market
had been in the doldrums as investors fretted about rising oil prices,
higher interest rates, the war in Iraq and a closely contested
presidential race. But the year ended on a high note with a sharp rally
sparked by a definitive end to the U.S. presidential election and
moderating oil prices.

Investors were brought back down to earth in January, however, as the
market declined in three of the four weeks and produced negative results
for the month in a broad-based move downward. Rising oil prices and
interest rates, and concerns about less robust corporate earnings growth
were among the culprits that kept investors on the sidelines. Investors
began to re-enter the market in February, reversing January's decline. But
as the month progressed into March and April investors again grew
concerned about further spikes in oil prices and rising interest rates. As
a result, the first four months of 2005 ended with the major indexes in
the red. By the end of April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
returned -4.81%, the S&P 500 Index returned -4.00%, while the Nasdaq
Composite Index fell by 11.67%. Bonds performed slightly better, managing
to produce positive results, with the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index
returning 0.87%.

The way the financial markets have been playing out recently serves as a
good reminder of why keeping a long-term perspective is such a critical
element of successful investing. Getting caught up in the day-to-day
twists and turns of the market -- and trying to act on them -- can wreak
havoc with your portfolio and derail progress toward meeting your overall
financial objectives.

Since no one can predict the market's moves, the best way to reach your
goals is to stay invested and stick to your plan. Investing should be a
marathon, not a sprint. Do not try to time the market, and make sure you
work with your investment professional to ensure that your portfolio
remains properly diversified to meet your long-term objectives. For
example, after several years of dominance, small-cap stocks and value
stocks could now represent higher percentages of your portfolio than you
may want. If you are comfortable with your financial plan, it becomes
easier to ride out the market's daily ups and downs. It could also provide
you with a greater chance of success over time.

Sincerely,

/S/ James A. Shepherdson

James A. Shepherdson,
Chief Executive Officer

MANAGEMENT TEAM

MANAGERS'
REPORT

JOHN HANCOCK
Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II

Dividend-paying securities encountered mixed conditions during the
six-month period ended April 30, 2005. Preferred stocks -- which are the
primary emphasis of John Hancock Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II --
performed reasonably well from the beginning of the period last November
through roughly mid-February 2005. Because preferreds make fixed payments
in the form of dividends, their prices tend to follow those of U.S.
Treasury securities. Despite evidence of a strengthening economy and
additional short-term interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Board,
preferred stock prices generally moved higher, mirroring a somewhat
positive tone in the U.S. Treasury market. That rally was based on
investors' confidence that even though the Fed might continue to raise
rates, those rate hikes would be small and measured given the potential
for record high oil prices and higher interest rates themselves to dampen
economic growth. Preferred stocks were further boosted by the combination
of constrained supply and strong demand. Supply was muted, as fewer
companies issued new preferred securities, while others bought back their
outstanding shares. Demand was fueled by investors' appetite for yield,
particularly in light of the fact that changes in the tax code in 2003
helped to make ownership of certain dividend-yielding stocks more
attractive. Investors also viewed the re-election of President George Bush
as a positive for tax-advantaged preferred stocks, because he vowed to
make permanent the 2003 provisions that reduced the tax rate most
individuals pay on many stock dividends.

"Dividend-paying securities
 encountered mixed conditions
 during the six-month period
 ended April 30, 2005."

From about mid-February through early April 2005, preferred stocks
weakened in response to a series of developments that suggested further
interest rate hikes were in the offing. These developments included
record-setting oil prices, stronger-than-expected data on the


2
<PAGE>


jobs market and comments from the Fed that it had seen evidence of a
pickup in inflation. Then, from mid April to the end of the period April
30, preferred stocks regained much of their lost ground as Treasury prices
rallied on weaker March employment and retail sales data, as well as
turbulence in the equity markets.

paragraph.]

Utility common stocks

Utility common stocks -- the Fund's other main focus -- also seesawed
during the period. They generally lagged the overall stock market in the
fourth quarter of 2004, as investors sought out companies with higher
growth prospects. But utility common stocks held their ground far better
than preferred and many other common-stock groups in the final weeks of
the period. Their resiliency was due to the combination of growing demand
for their tax-advantaged dividends and a perception that utility
companies' financial shape continued to improve.

"The strong demand for tax-
 advantaged preferred holdings
 helped support many of our
 holdings that sported that feature."

Performance

For the six months ended April 30, 2005, John Hancock Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II returned 6.62% at net asset value and 6.78% at market
value. The difference in the Fund's net asset value (NAV) performance and
its market performance stems from the fact that the market share price is
subject to the dynamics of secondary market trading, which could cause it
to trade at a discount or premium to the Fund's NAV share price at any
time. By comparison, the average income and preferred stock closed-end
fund returned 4.28% at net asset value, according to Lipper, Inc. In the
same six-month period, the Dow Jones Utility Average -- which tracks the
performance of 15 electric and natural gas utilities -- returned 20.75%,
and the broader stock market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500
Index returned 3.28%.

Tax-advantaged holdings among top performers

The strong demand for tax-advantaged preferred stocks helped support many
of our holdings that sported that feature. A good example was Baltimore
Gas & Electric Co., a regulated electric and gas public utility in central
Maryland. It also benefited from the


3
<PAGE>


fact that it carried a high coupon, which helped cushion its price
declines, and the fact that there is a limited supply of this high-quality
holding. Southern Union Co. also enjoyed relatively good performance for
similar reasons. On the flip side, our lower-coupon holdings in Royal Bank
of Scotland, a major commercial bank, proved somewhat disappointing.

Multi-utilities & unregulated power - 23%, the third is Gas utilities -

Consumer finance - 2%, the ninth is Regional banks - 2%, the tenth is
Integrated oil & gas - 1%, the eleventh is Agricultural products - 1% and
the twelfth is All other - 3%.]

Oil and gas-related utility stocks also post strong results

Rising energy prices provided the fuel for improved company profitability
and higher prices for some of our holdings in utility common stocks
involved with oil and gas production. Among the best performers were our
common-stock holdings in Dominion Resources, one of the nation's largest
producers of energy. Other winners in this segment included National Fuel
Gas Co., an integrated natural gas company, and NiSource Inc., which is
engaged in natural gas transmission, storage and distribution, as well as
electric generation, transmission and distribution. Among our preferred
stock holdings in this sector, we had strong performances from Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., Apache Corporation and Devon Energy Corp.

stocks 64%, Common stocks 35%, and Short-term investments & other 1%.]

Outlook

In our view, the Fed probably hasn't yet reached the end of its campaign
to raise short-term interest rates to cool economic growth and potential
inflationary pressures. This could pose periodic short-term challenges for
dividend-producing securities. Over the longer term, however, we're more
upbeat, especially given the fact that we believe a good portion, if not
all, of future

interest rate hikes already have been factored into preferred and utility
common stock prices. Furthermore, there are already some tangible signs
that economic growth has cooled as rates have moved higher. The housing
market has started to slow, with adjustable-rate mortgages moving higher
and conventional 30-year mortgages exceeding 6% at times. Higher oil
prices will also probably act as a drag on economic growth, most likely by
reducing consumers' disposable income and raising corporate America's cost
of doing business. Another signal pointing to slack economic growth is the
March retail sales numbers, which were lackluster at best. We believe that
a slower-growth, low-inflationary environment will provide a favorable
backdrop for both preferred and utility common stocks. That, coupled with
what we believe will continue to be a favorable supply and demand
backdrop, could benefit many dividend-paying securities in the months to
come.

"We believe that a slower-growth,
 low-inflationary environment
 will provide a favorable backdrop
 for both preferred and utility
 common stocks."

This commentary reflects the views of the team through the end of the
Fund's period discussed in this report. The team's statements reflect
their own opinions. As such they are in no way guarantees of future

The Fund normally will invest at least 65% of its managed assets in
securities of companies in the utilities industry. Such an investment
concentration makes the Fund more susceptible than a more broadly
diversified fund to factors adversely affecting the utilities industry.
Sector investing is subject to greater risks than the market as a whole.

NOTES TO
STATEMENTS

Unaudited

Note A
Accounting policies

John Hancock Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified closed-end management investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

Significant accounting policies
of the Fund are as follows:

Valuation of investments

Securities in the Fund's portfolio are valued on the basis of market
quotations, valuations provided by independent pricing services or at fair
value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved
by the Trustees. Short-term debt investments which have a remaining
maturity of 60 days or less may be valued at amortized cost which
approximates market value. The Fund determines the net asset value of the
common shares each business day.

Investment transactions

Investment transactions are recorded as of the date of purchase, sale or
maturity. Net realized gains and losses on sales of investments are
determined on the identified cost basis.

Expenses

The majority of expenses are directly identifiable to an individual fund.
Expenses that are not readily identifiable to a specific fund are
allocated in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into consideration,
among other things, the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes
of the funds.

Federal income taxes

The Fund qualifies as a "regulated investment company" by complying with
the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and will not be
subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. For
federal income tax purposes, the Fund has $52,139 of a capital loss
carryforward available, to the extent provided by regulations, to offset
future net realized capital gains. To the extent that such carryforward is
used by the Fund, no capital gain distributions will be made. The loss
carryforward expires as follows: October 31, 2010 -- $30,872 and October
31, 2011 -- $21,267.

Dividends, interest
and distributions

Dividend income on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend
date or, in the case of some foreign securities, on the date thereafter
when the Fund identifies the dividend. Interest income on investment
securities is recorded on the accrual basis. The Fund may place a security
on a non-accrual status and reduced related investment income by ceasing
current accruals or writing off interest, or dividends receivable when the
collection of income has become doubtful. Foreign income may be subject to
foreign withholding taxes, which are accrued as applicable.

The Fund records distributions to common and preferred shareholders from
net investment

income and net realized gains, if any, on the ex-dividend
date. During the year ended October 31, 2004, the tax character of
distributions paid was as follows: ordinary income $13,498,673.

Such distributions, on a tax basis, are determined in conformity with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Distributions in
excess of tax basis earnings and profits, if any, are reported in the
Fund's financial statements as a return of capital.

Use of estimates

The preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
incorporates estimates made by management in determining the reported
amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Fund. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

Note B
Management fee and
transactions with
affiliates and others

The Fund has an investment management contract with John Hancock Advisers,
LLC (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of John Hancock Financial
Services, Inc. Under the investment management contract, the Fund pays a
monthly management fee to the Adviser at an annual rate of 0.50% of the
Fund's average weekly net assets and the value attributable to the Dutch
Auction Rate Transferable Securities preferred shares (collectively,
"managed assets"), plus 5.00% of the Fund's weekly gross income. The
Adviser's total fee is limited to a maximum amount equal to 1.00% annually
of the Fund's average weekly managed assets. For the period ended April
30, 2005, the advisory fee incurred did not exceed the maximum advisory
fee allowed.

The Fund has an administrative agreement with the Adviser under which the
Adviser oversees the custodial, auditing, valuation, accounting, legal,
stock transfer and dividend disbursing services and maintains Fund
communications with the shareholders. The Fund pays the Adviser a monthly
administration fee at an annual rate of 0.10% of the Fund's average weekly
managed assets. The compensation for the period amounted to $139,737. The
Fund also paid the Adviser the amount of $5 for certain publishing
services, included in the printing fees.

Mr. James A. Shepherdson is a director and officer of the Adviser, as well
as affiliated Trustee of the Fund, and is compensated by the Adviser. The
compensation of unaffiliated Trustees is borne by the Fund. The
unaffiliated Trustees may elect to defer, for tax purposes, their receipt
of this compensation under the John Hancock Group of Funds Deferred
Compensation Plan. The Fund makes investments into other John Hancock
funds, as applicable, to cover its liability for the deferred
compensation. Investments to cover the Fund's deferred compensation
liability are recorded on the Fund's books as an other asset. The deferred
compensation liability and the related other asset are always equal and
are marked to market on a periodic basis to reflect any income earned by
the investments, as well as any unrealized gains or losses. The Deferred
Compensation Plan investments had no impact on the operations of the Fund.

The Fund is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and
has filed with the NYSE its chief executive officer certification
regarding compliance with the NYSE's listing standards. The Fund also
files with the Securities and Exchange Commission the certification of its
chief executive officer and chief accounting officer required by Section
302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Dutch Auction Rate
Transferable Securities
preferred shares Series A
and Series B

The Fund issued Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities preferred
shares ("DARTS"), 598 shares of Series A and 598 shares of Series B in a
public offering. The underwriting discount was recorded as a reduction of
the capital of common shares. During the year ended October 31, 1990, the
Fund retired 98 shares of DARTS from both Series A and Series B.

Dividends on the DARTS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate that
was established at the offering of the DARTS and has been reset every 49
days thereafter by an auction. Dividend rates on DARTS Series A and B
ranged from 1.79% to 2.40% and from 1.99% to 2.49%, respectively, during
the period ended April 30, 2005. Accrued dividends on DARTS are included
in the value of DARTS on the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

The DARTS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption price
equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
dividend payment date. The DARTS are also subject to mandatory redemption
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends, if the Fund is in default on its asset coverage
requirements with respect to the DARTS, as defined in the Fund's by-laws.
If the dividends on the DARTS shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to
two full years' dividends, the holders of the DARTS, as a class, have the
right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the
holders of the DARTS and the common shareholders have equal voting rights
of one vote per share, except that the holders of the DARTS, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Trustees, and separate class
votes are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests
of the DARTS and common shareholders.

Note D
Investment
transactions

Purchases and proceeds from sales or maturities of securities, other than
short-term securities and obligations of the U.S. government, during the
period ended April 30, 2005, aggregated $9,611,463 and $6,025,134,
respectively.

The cost of investments owned on April 30, 2005, including short-term
investments, for federal income tax purposes, was $265,030,446. Gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments aggregated
$29,128,531 and $12,260,307, respectively, resulting in net unrealized
appreciation of $16,868,224. The difference between book basis and tax
basis net unrealized appreciation of investments is attributable primarily
to the tax deferral of losses on certain sales of securities.

Investment
objective
and policy

The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high current income
consistent with modest growth of capital for holders of its common shares
of beneficial interest. The Fund will pursue its objective by investing in
a diversified portfolio of dividend paying preferred and common stocks.

The Fund's non-fundamental investment policy, with respect to the quality
of ratings of its portfolio investments, was changed by a vote of the
Fund's Trustees on September 13, 1994. The policy, which became effective
October 15, 1994, stipulates that preferred stocks and debt obligations in
which the Fund will invest will be rated investment-grade (at least "BBB"
by S&P or "Baa" by Moody's) at the time of investment or will be preferred
stocks of issuers of investment-grade senior debt, some of which may have
speculative characteristics, or, if not rated, will be of comparable
quality as determined by the Adviser. The Fund will invest in common
stocks of issuers whose senior debt is rated investment-grade or, in the
case of issuers that have no rated senior debt outstanding, whose senior
debt is considered by the Adviser to be of comparable quality.

On November 20, 2001, the Fund's Trustees approved the following
investment policy investment restriction change, effective December 15,
2001. Under normal circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80% of its
assets in dividend-paying securities. The "Assets" are defined as net
assets including the liquidation preference amount of the DARTS plus
borrowings for investment purposes.  The Fund will notify shareholders at
least 60 days prior to any change in this 80% investment policy.

By-laws

In November 2002, the Board of Trustees adopted several amendments to the
Fund's by-laws, including provisions relating to the calling of a special
meeting and requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals or nominees
for Trustee. The advance notice provisions in the by-laws require
shareholders to notify the Fund in writing of any proposal that they
intend to present at an annual meeting of share- holders, including any
nominations for Trustee, between 90 and 120 days prior to the first
anniversary of the mailing date of the notice from the prior year's annual
meeting of shareholders. The notification must be in the form prescribed
by the by-laws. The advance notice provisions provide the Fund and its
Trustees with the opportunity to thoughtfully consider and address the
matters proposed before the Fund prepares and mails its proxy statement to
shareholders. Other amendments set forth the procedures that must be
followed in order for a shareholder to call a special meeting of
shareholders. Please contact the Secretary of the Fund for additional
information about the advance notice requirements or the other amendments
to the by-laws.

On December 16, 2003, the Trustees approved the following change to the
Fund's by-laws. The auction preferred section of the Fund's by-laws was
changed to update the rating agency requirements, in keeping with recent
changes to the agencies' basic maintenance reporting requirements for
leveraged closed-end funds. By-laws now require an independent
accountant's confirmation only once per year, at the Fund's fiscal year
end, and changes to the agencies' basic maintenance reporting requirements
that include modifications to the eligible assets and their respective
discount factors. These revisions bring the Fund's by-laws in line with
current rating agency requirements.

On September 14, 2004, the Trustees approved an amendment to the Fund's
by-laws increasing the maximum applicable dividend rate ceiling on the
preferred shares to conform with the modern calculation methodology used
by the industry and other John Hancock funds.

Dividend
reinvestment plan

The Fund offers its shareholders a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
"Plan"), which offers the opportunity to earn compounded yields. Each
holder of common shares may elect to have all distributions of dividends
and capital gains reinvested by Mellon Investor Services, as plan agent
for the common shareholders (the "Plan Agent"). Holders of common shares
who do not elect to participate in the Plan will receive all distributions
in cash, paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or,
if the common shares are held in street or other nominee name, then to the
nominee) by the Plan Agent, as dividend disbursing agent.

Shareholders may join the Plan by filling out and mailing an authorization
card, by notifying the Plan Agent by telephone, or by visiting the Plan
Agent's Web site at www.melloninvestor.com. Shareholders must indicate an
election to reinvest all or a portion of dividend payments.  If received
in proper form by the Plan Agent before the record date of a dividend, the
election will be effective with respect to all dividends paid after such
record date. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or
nominee should contact the broker or nominee to determine whether and how
they may participate in the Plan.

If the Fund declares a dividend payable either in common shares or in
cash, non-participants will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in common shares. If the market price of the common
shares on the payment date of the dividend is equal to or exceeds their
net asset value as determined on the payment date, participants will be
issued common shares (out of authorized but unissued shares) at a value
equal to the higher of net asset value or 95% of the market price. If the
net asset value exceeds the market price of the common shares at such
time, or if the Board of Trustees declares a dividend payable only in
cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy shares in
the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts. Such purchases will be made promptly after the
payable date for such dividend and, in any event, prior to the next
ex-dividend date after such date, except where necessary to comply with
federal securities laws. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value of the common
shares, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may
exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in shares
issued by the Fund.

Each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in
connection with the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. In each
case, the cost per share of the shares purchased for each participant's
account will be the average cost, including brokerage commissions, of any
shares purchased on the open market plus the cost of any shares issued by
the Fund. There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares
issued directly by the Fund. There are no other charges to participants
for reinvesting dividends or capital gain distributions.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan at any time by
contacting the Plan Agent by telephone, in writing or by visiting the Plan
Agent's Web site at www.melloninvestor.com.  Such withdrawal will be
effective immediately if received not less than ten days prior to a
dividend record date; otherwise, it will be effective for all subsequent
dividend record dates. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon
termination of the Plan, as provided below, certificates for whole common
shares credited to his or her account under the Plan will be issued and a
cash payment will be made for any fraction of a share credited to such
account.


19
<PAGE>


The Plan Agent maintains each shareholder's account in the Plan and
furnishes monthly written confirmations of all transactions in the
accounts, including information needed by the shareholders for personal
and tax records. The Plan Agent will hold common shares in the account of
each Plan participant in noncertificated form in the name of the
participant. Proxy material relating to the shareholders' meetings of the
Fund will include those shares purchased as well as shares held pursuant
to the Plan.

The reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any federal income tax that may be payable or required to
be withheld on such dividends or distributions. Participants under the
Plan will receive tax information annually. The amount of dividend to be
reported on 1099-DIV should be (1) in the case of shares issued by the
Fund, the fair market value of such shares on the dividend payment date
and (2) in the case of shares purchased by the Plan Agent in the open
market, the amount of cash used by the Plan Agent to purchase shares in
the open market, including the amount of cash allocated to brokerage
commissions paid on such purchases.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice
of the change sent to all shareholders of the Fund at least 90 days before
the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan may be amended
or terminated by the Plan Agent after at least 90 days' written notice to
all shareholders of the Fund. All correspondence or additional information
concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent, Mellon Bank,
N.A., c/o Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ
07606-1938 (telephone 1-800-852-0218).

ITEM 2.  CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period, April 30, 2005, the registrant has adopted a
code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR, that applies to its
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

for access persons to preclear their personal trades of John Hancock mutual
funds.  This was replaced by post-trade reporting and a 30 day hold
requirement for all employees.

(c) A new requirement for "heightened preclearance" with investment
supervisors by any access person trading in a personal position worth
$100,000 or more.

ITEM 11.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)      Based upon their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures as conducted within 90 days of the filing date of
this Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that those disclosure controls and
procedures provide reasonable assurance that the material information
required to be disclosed by the registrant on this report is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of
an annual report) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

Owner:               Tim Fagan
Administrator:       Tim Fagan
Last Revision Date:  02/05
Next Revision Date:  05/05


This is the code of ethics of:
o  John Hancock Advisers, LLC
o  Sovereign Asset Management Co.
o  each open-end and closed-end fund advised by John Hancock Advisers, LLC
o  John Hancock Funds, LLC
(together, called "John Hancock Funds")


1.  General Principles

Each person within the John Hancock Funds organization is responsible
for maintaining the very highest ethical standards when conducting our
business. This means that:

o  You have a fiduciary duty at all times to place the interests of
   our clients first.

o  All of your personal securities transactions must be conducted
   consistent with this code of ethics and in such a manner as to avoid
   any actual or potential conflict of interest or other abuse of your
   position of trust and responsibility.

o  You should not take inappropriate advantage of your position or
   engage in any fraudulent or manipulative practice (such as
   front-running or manipulative market timing) with respect to our
   clients' accounts.

o  You must treat as confidential any information concerning the
   identity of security holdings and financial circumstances of
   clients.

o  You must comply with all applicable federal securities laws.

o  You must promptly report any violation of this code of ethics that
   comes to your attention to the Chief Compliance Officer, Timothy M.
   Fagan, or the Chief Legal Officer, Susan S. Newton.

The General Principles discussed above govern all conduct, whether or
not the conduct is also covered by more specific standards and
procedures in this code of ethics.  As described below under the
heading "Interpretation and Enforcement", failure to comply with the
code of ethics may result in disciplinary action, including
termination of employment.


2.  To Whom Does This Code Apply?

This code of ethics applies to you if you are a director, officer or
employee of John Hancock Advisers, LLC, Sovereign Asset Management
Co., John Hancock Funds, LLC or a "John Hancock fund" (any fund
advised by John Hancock Advisers, LLC or Sovereign Asset Management
Co.). It also applies to you if you are an employee of John Hancock
Life Insurance Co. or its subsidiaries who participates in making
recommendations for, or receives information about, portfolio trades
or holdings of the John Hancock funds or accounts.  Certain
provisions apply to trustees of the John Hancock mutual funds and
closed-end funds-see Appendix C for more information.

Please note that if a policy described below applies to you, it also
applies all accounts over which you have a beneficial interest.
Normally, you will be deemed to have a beneficial interest in your
personal accounts, those of a spouse, "significant other," minor
children or family members sharing a household, as well as all
accounts over which you have discretion or give advice or information.
"Significant others" are defined for these purposes as two people
who (1) share the same primary residence; (2) share living expenses;
and (3) are in a committed relationship and intend to remain in the
relationship indefinitely.

There are three main categories for persons covered by this code of
ethics, taking into account their positions, duties and access to
information regarding fund portfolio trades. You have been notified
about which of these categories applies to you, based on the
Investment Compliance Department's understanding of your current role.
If you have a level of investment access beyond your assigned
category, or if you are promoted or change duties and as a result
should more appropriately be included in a different category, it is
your responsibility to notify Timothy M. Fagan, Chief Compliance
Officer.

The basic definitions of the three main categories, with examples, are
provided below. The more detailed definitions of each category are
attached as Appendix A.

<TABLE>
<S>                                     <C>                                    <C>
- --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
     "Investment Access" person                "Regular Access" person                 "Non-Access" person

A person who regularly participates        A person who regularly obtains        A person who does not regularly
 in a fund's investment process or         information regarding (1) fund        participate in a fund's investment

- ---------                               ---------                                ---------
o  portfolio managers                   o  personnel in Investment               o  wholesalers
o  analysts                                Operations or Compliance              o  inside wholesalers who
o  traders                              o  most FFM personnel                       don't attend investment
                                        o  Technology personnel with                "morning meetings"
                                           access to investment systems          o  certain administrative
                                        o  attorneys and some legal                 personnel
                                           administration personnel
                                        o  investment admin. personnel
- --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
</TABLE>


3.  Which Accounts and Securities are Subject to the Code's Personal
Trading Restrictions?

If this code of ethics describes "Personal Trading Requirements" (i.e.
John Hancock Mutual Fund reporting requirement and holding period, the
preclearance requirement, the ban on short-term profits, the ban on
IPOs, the disclosure of private placement conflicts and the reporting
requirements) that apply to your access category as described above,
then the requirements apply to trades for any account over which you
have a beneficial interest. Normally, this includes your personal
accounts, those of a spouse, "significant other," minor children or
family members sharing your household, as well as all accounts over
which you have discretion or give advice or information. This
includes all brokerage accounts that contain securities (including
brokerage accounts that only contain securities exempt from
reporting).  Accounts over which you have no direct or indirect
influence or control are exempt. To prevent potential violations of
this code of ethics, you are strongly encouraged to request
clarification for any accounts that are in question.


These personal trading requirements do not apply to the following
securities:

o  Direct obligations of the U.S. government (e.g., treasury
   securities);

o  Bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial
   paper, and high quality short-term debt obligations, including
   repurchase agreements;

o  Shares of open-end mutual funds that are not advised or sub-advised
   by John Hancock Advisers or by John Hancock or Manulife entities;

o  Shares issued by money market funds; and

o  Securities in accounts over which you have no direct or indirect
   influence or control.


Except as noted above, the Personal Trading Requirements apply to all
securities, including:

o  stocks or bonds;

o  government securities that are not direct obligations of the U.S.
   government, such as Fannie Mae or municipal securities;

o  Shares of all closed-end funds;

o  Options on securities, on indexes, and on currencies;

o  All kinds of limited partnerships;

o  Foreign unit trusts and foreign mutual funds;

o  Private investment funds and hedge funds; and

o  Futures, investment contracts or any other instrument that is
   considered a "security" under the Investment Advisers Act.


Different requirements apply to shares of open-end mutual funds that
are advised or sub-advised by John Hancock Advisers or by John Hancock
or Manulife entities-see the section below titled "John Hancock Mutual
Funds Reporting Requirement and Holding Period".

5.  Policies Outside the Code of Ethics

John Hancock Funds has certain policies that are not part of the code
of ethics, but are equally important.  The two most important of these
policies are (1) the Company Conflict and Business Practice Policy;
and (2) the Inside Information Policy.


>>  Company Conflict & Business Practice Policy

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

A conflict of interest occurs when your private interests interfere or
could potentially interfere with your responsibilities at work. You
must not place yourself or the company in a position of actual
or potential conflict.

This Policy for officers and employees covers a number of important
issues. For example, you cannot serve as a director of any company
without first obtaining the required written executive approval.

This Policy includes significant requirements to be followed if your
personal securities holdings overlap with John Hancock Funds
investment activity. For example, if you or a member of your family own:

o  a 5% or greater interest in a company, John Hancock Funds and its
   affiliates may not make any investment in that company;

o  a 1% or greater interest in a company, you cannot participate in any
   decision by John Hancock Funds and its affiliates to buy or sell
   that company's securities;

o  ANY interest in a company, you cannot recommend or participate in a
   decision by John Hancock Funds and its affiliates to buy or sell
   that company's securities unless your personal interest is fully
   disclosed at all stages of the investment decision.

(This is just a summary of this requirement-please read Section IV of
the Company Conflict and Business Practices Policy for more detailed
information.)


Other important issues in this Policy include:

o  personal investments or business relationships

o  misuse of inside information

o  receiving or giving of gifts, entertainment or favors

o  misuse or misrepresentation of your corporate position

o  disclosure of confidential or proprietary information

o  antitrust activities

o  political campaign contributions and expenditures on public officials


>>  Inside Information Policy and Procedures

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws generally
prohibit persons with material non-public information from trading on
or communicating the information to others. Sanctions for
violations can include civil injunctions, permanent bars from the
securities industry, civil penalties up to three times the profits
made or losses avoided, criminal fines and jail sentences. While
Investment Access persons are most likely to come in contact with
material non-public information, the rules (and sanctions) in this
area apply to all John Hancock Funds personnel and extend to
activities both related and unrelated to your job duties.

The Inside Information Policy and Procedures covers a number of
important issues, such as:

o  The misuse of material non-public information

o  The information barrier procedure

o  The "restricted list" and the "watch list"

o  broker letters and duplicate confirmation statements (see section 7
   of this code of ethics)


>> Policy Regarding Dissemination of Mutual Fund Portfolio Information

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

Information about securities held in a mutual fund cannot be disclosed
except in accordance with this Policy, which generally requires time
delays of approximately one month and public posting of the
information to ensure that it uniformly enters the public domain.


6.  Policies in the Code of Ethics

>> Restriction on Gifts

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

You and your family cannot accept preferential treatment or favors
(for example, gifts) from securities brokers or dealers or other
organizations with which John Hancock Funds might transact
business, except in accordance with the Company Conflict and Business
Practice Policy. For the protection of both you and John Hancock
Funds, the appearance of a possible conflict of interest must be
avoided. You should exercise caution in any instance in which business
travel and lodging are paid for by someone other than John Hancock
Funds. The purpose of this policy is to minimize the basis for any
charge that you used your John Hancock Funds position to obtain for
yourself opportunities which otherwise would not be offered to you.
Please see the Company Conflict and Business Practice Policy's
"Compensation and Gifts" section for additional details regarding
restrictions on gifts and exceptions for "nominal value" gifts.


>> John Hancock Mutual Funds Reporting Requirement and Holding Period

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

You must follow a reporting requirement and a holding period
requirement if you purchase either:

o  a "John Hancock Mutual Fund" (i.e. a mutual fund that is advised by
   John Hancock Advisers or by John Hancock or Manulife entity,
   excluding the money market funds and any dividend reinvestment,
   payroll deduction, systematic investment/withdrawal and other
   program trades); or

o  a "John Hancock Variable Product" (i.e. contacts funded by
   insurance company separate accounts that use one or more portfolios
   of Manufacturers Investment Trust or John Hancock Variable Series
   Trust).

Reporting Requirement: You must report your holdings and your trades
in a John Hancock Mutual Fund or a John Hancock Variable Product.
This is not a preclearance requirement-you can report your holdings
after you trade by submitting duplicate confirmation statements to the
Investment Compliance Department. If you are an Investment Access
Person or a Regular Access Person, you must also make sure that your
holdings in a John Hancock Mutual Fund are included in your Initial
Holdings Report (upon hire) and Annual Holdings Report (each year
end).

If you purchase a John Hancock Variable Product, you must notify the
Investment Compliance Department. The Investment Compliance
Department will then obtain directly from the contract administrators
the personal trade and holdings information regarding the portfolios
underlying the Manulife or John Hancock variable insurance contracts.

The Investment Compliance Department will obtain personal securities
trade and holdings information in the 401(k) plans for John Hancock
Funds or John Hancock employees directly from the plan administrators.

Holding Requirement: You cannot profit from the purchase and sale of
a John Hancock Mutual Fund within 30 calendar days.  The purpose of
this policy is to address the risk, real or perceived, of manipulative
market timing or other abusive practices involving short-term personal
trading in the John Hancock Mutual Funds. Any profits realized on
short-term trades must be surrendered by check payable to John Hancock
Advisers, LLC and will be contributed by John Hancock Advisers, LLC to
a charity, upon determination by the Compliance and Business Practices
Committee. If you give away a security, it is considered a sale. You
may request an exemption from this policy for involuntary sales due to
unforeseen corporate activity (such as a merger), or hardship reasons
(such as unexpected medical expenses) by sending an e-mail to Timothy
M. Fagan, Chief Compliance Officer.


>>  Preclearance of Securities Transactions

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
             Regular Access Persons

Also, for a limited category of trades:
            --------------------------
                Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

Limited Category of Trades for Non-Access Persons: If you are a
Non-Access person, you must preclear transactions in securities of any
closed-end funds advised by John Hancock Advisers, LLC. A Non-Access
person is not required to preclear other trades. However, please keep
in mind that a Non-Access person is required to report securities
transactions after every trade (even those that are not required to be
precleared) by requiring your broker to submit duplicate confirmation
statements, as described in section 7 of this code of ethics.

Investment Access persons and Regular Access persons: If you are an
Investment Access person or Regular Access person, you must "preclear"
(i.e.: receive advance approval of) any personal securities
transactions in the categories described above in the section "Which
Accounts and Securities are Subject to the Code's Personal Trading
Restrictions". Due to this preclearance requirement, participation in
investment clubs is prohibited.

Preclearance of private placements requires some special considerations
- -- the decision will take into account whether, for example: (1) the
investment opportunity should be reserved for John Hancock Funds
clients; and (2) it is being offered to you because of your position
with John Hancock Funds.

How to preclear: You preclear a trade by following the steps outlined
in the preclearance procedures, which are attached as Appendix B.
Please note that:

o   You may not trade until clearance is received.

o   Clearance approval is valid only for the date granted (i.e. the
    preclearance date and the trade date should be the same.

o   A separate procedure should be followed for requesting preclearance of
    a private placement or a derivative, as detailed in Appendix B. The
    Investment Compliance Department must maintain a five-year record of
    all clearances of private placement purchases by Investment Access
    persons, and the reasons supporting the clearances.

The preclearance policy is designed to proactively identify possible
"problem trades" that raise front-running, manipulative market timing
or other conflict of interest concerns (example: when an Investment
Access person trades a security on the same day as a John Hancock
fund).


>> Heightened Preclearance of Securities Transactions for "Significant
Personal Positions"

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
             Regular Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an Investment Access person or Regular Access person with a
personal securities position that is worth $100,000 or more, this is
deemed to be a "Significant Personal Position". This applies to any
personal securities positions in the categories described above in the
section "Which Accounts and Securities are Subject to the Code's
Personal Trading Restrictions". Before you make personal trades to
establish, increase or decrease a Significant Personal Position, you
must notify either the Chief Fixed Income Officer or the Chief Equity
Officer that (1) you intend to trade in a Significant Personal
Position and (2) confirm that you are not aware of any clients for
whom related trades should be completed first. You must receive their
pre-approval to proceed--their approval will be based on their
conclusion that your personal trade in a Significant Personal Position
will not "front-run" any action that John Hancock Funds should take
for a client. This Heightened Preclearance requirement is in addition
to, not in place of, the regular preclearance requirement described
above-you must also receive the regular preclearance before you trade.


>> Ban on Short-Term Profits

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an Investment Access person, you cannot profit from the
purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) of the same (or equivalent)
securities within 60 calendar days.  This applies to any personal
securities trades in the categories described above in the section
"Which Accounts and Securities are Subject to the Code's Personal
Trading Restrictions".

You may invest in derivatives or sell short provided the transaction
period exceeds the 60-day holding period. If you give away a security,
it is considered a sale.

The purpose of this policy is to address the risk, real or perceived,
of front-running, manipulative market timing or other abusive
practices involving short-term personal trading. Any profits realized
on short-term trades must be surrendered by check payable to John
Hancock Advisers, LLC and will be contributed by John Hancock
Advisers, LLC to a charity, upon determination by the Compliance and
Business Practices Committee.

You may request an exemption from this policy for involuntary sales
due to unforeseen corporate activity (such as a merger), or hardship
reasons (such as unexpected medical expenses) by sending an e-mail to
Timothy M. Fagan, Chief Compliance Officer.


>> Ban on IPOs

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an Investment Access person, you may not acquire securities
in an initial public offering (IPO). You may not purchase any
newly-issued securities until the next business (trading) day after
the offering date. This applies to any personal securities trades in
the categories described above in the section "Which Accounts and
Securities are Subject to the Code's Personal Trading Restrictions".

There are two main reasons for this prohibition: (1) these purchases
may suggest that persons have taken inappropriate advantage of their
positions for personal profit; and (2) these purchases may create at
least the appearance that an investment opportunity that should have
been available to the John Hancock funds was diverted to the personal
benefit of an individual employee.

You may request an exemption for certain investments that do not
create a potential conflict of interest, such as: (1) securities of a
mutual bank or mutual insurance company received as compensation in a
demutualization and other similar non-voluntary stock acquisitions;
(2) fixed rights offerings; or (3) a family member's participation as
a form of employment compensation in their employer's IPO.


>> Disclosure of Private Placement Conflicts

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an Investment Access person and you own securities
purchased in a private placement, you must  disclose  that  holding
when  you participate in a decision to purchase or sell that same
issuer's securities for a John Hancock fund. This applies to any
private placement holdings in the categories described above in the
section "Which Accounts and Securities are Subject to the Code's
Personal Trading Restrictions". Private placements are securities
exempt from SEC registration under section 4(2), section 4(6) or rules
504 -506 of the Securities Act of 1933.

The investment decision must be subject to an independent review by
investment personnel with no personal interest in the issuer.

The purpose of this policy is to provide appropriate scrutiny in
situations in which there is a potential conflict of interest.


>> Seven Day Blackout Period

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are a portfolio manager (or were identified to the Investment
Compliance Department as part of a portfolio management team) you are
prohibited from buying or selling a security within seven calendar
days before and after that security is traded for a fund that you
manage unless no conflict of interest exists in relation to that
security (as determined by the Compliance and Ethics Committee).

In addition, all investment access persons are prohibited from
knowingly buying or selling a security within seven calendar days
before and after that security is traded for a John Hancock fund
unless no conflict of interest exists in relation to that security.
This applies to any personal securities trades in the categories
described above in the section "Which Accounts and Securities are
Subject to the Code's Personal Trading Restrictions".  If a John
Hancock fund trades in a security within seven calendar days before or
after you trade in that security, you may be required to demonstrate
that you did not know that the trade was being considered for that
John Hancock fund.

You will be required to sell any security purchased in violation of
this policy unless it is determined that no conflict of interest
exists in relation to that security (as determined by the Compliance
and Ethics Committee). Any profits realized on trades determined by
the Compliance and Ethics Committee to be in violation of this policy
must be surrendered by check payable to John Hancock Advisers, LLC and
will be contributed by John Hancock Advisers, LLC to a charity.


7. Reports and Other Disclosures Outside the Code of Ethics


>> Broker Letter/Duplicate Confirm Statements

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

As required by the Inside Information Policy, you must inform your
stockbroker that you are employed by an investment adviser or broker.
Your broker is subject to certain rules designed to prevent
favoritism toward your accounts. You may not accept negotiated
commission rates that you believe may be more favorable than the
broker grants to accounts with similar characteristics.

When a brokerage account is opened for which you have a beneficial
interest, before any trades are made, you must:

o  Notify the broker-dealer with which you are opening an account that
   you are a registered associate of JHF;

o  Ask the firm in writing to have duplicate written confirmations of
   any trade, as well as statements or other information concerning
   the account, sent to the JHF Investment Compliance Department
   (contact: Fred Spring), 10th Floor, 101 Huntington Avenue, Boston,
   MA 02199; and

o  Notify the JHF Investment Compliance Department, in writing, that
   you have an account before you place any trades.

This applies to any personal securities trades in the categories
described above in the section "Which Accounts and Securities are
Subject to the Code's Personal Trading Restrictions" as well as trades
in John Hancock Mutual Funds and John Hancock Variable Products. The
Investment Compliance Department may rely on information submitted by
your broker as part of your reporting requirements under this code of
ethics.


8. Reports and Other Disclosures In the Code of Ethics

>> Initial Holdings Report and Annual Holdings Report

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

You must file an initial holdings report within 10 calendar days after
becoming an Investment Access person or a Regular Access person. The
information must be current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to
your becoming an Investment Access person or a Regular Access person.

You must also file an annual holdings report (as of December
31st) within 45 calendar days after the calendar year end. This
applies to any personal securities holdings in the categories
described above in the section "Which Accounts and Securities are
Subject to the Code's Personal Trading Restrictions" as well as
holdings in John Hancock Mutual Funds and John Hancock Variable
Products.

Your reports must include:

o  the title and type of security, and as applicable the exchange ticker
   symbol or CUSIP number, number of shares, and principal amount of each
   reportable security;

o  the name of any broker, dealer or bank with which you maintain an
   account; and

o  the date that you submit the report.


>> Quarterly Transaction Reports

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

You must file a quarterly transaction report within 30 calendar days
after the end of a calendar quarter if you are an Investment Access
person or a Regular Access person. This report must cover all
transactions during the past calendar quarter for any accounts and
personal securities trades in the categories described above in the
section "Which Accounts and Securities are Subject to the Code's
Personal Trading Restrictions" as well as transactions in John Hancock
Mutual Funds and John Hancock Variable Products.  You must submit a
quarterly report even if you have no transactions during the quarter.

Your quarterly transaction report must include the following
information about these transactions:

o  the date of the transaction, the title, and as applicable the
   exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, interest rate and maturity
   date, number of shares, and principal amount of each reportable
   security involved;

o  the nature of the transaction (i.e. purchase, sale or any other
   type of acquisition or disposition);

o  the price at which the transaction was effected;

o  the name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the
   transaction was effected; and

o  the date that you submit the report.


>> Annual Certification

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:   Investment Access Persons
              Regular Access Persons
              Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

At least annually (or additionally when the code of ethics has been
significantly changed), you must provide a certification at a date
designated by the Investment Compliance Department that:

(1) you have read and understood this  code of ethics;

(2) you recognize that you are subject to its policies; and

(3) you have complied with its requirements.

You are required to make this certification to demonstrate that you
understand the importance of these policies and your responsibilities
under the code of ethics.


9. Limited Access Persons

There is an additional category of persons called "Limited Access"
persons. This category consists only of directors of John Hancock
Advisers, LLC or the John Hancock funds who:

(a) are not also officers of John Hancock Advisers, LLC; and

(b) do not ordinarily obtain information about fund portfolio trades.

A more detailed definition of Limited Access persons, and a list of
the policies that apply to them, is attached as Appendix C.


10. Subadvisers

A subadviser to a John Hancock fund has a number of code of ethics
responsibilities, as described in Appendix D.


11. Reporting Violations

If you know of any violation of our code of ethics, you have a
responsibility to promptly report it. You should also report any
deviations from the controls and procedures that safeguard John
Hancock Funds and the assets of our clients. You can request
confidential treatment of your reporting action.

You can report violations to:

o  Timothy M. Fagan, Chief Compliance Officer (617-375-6205); or

o  Susan S. Newton, Chief Legal Officer (617-375-1702)


12. Interpretation and Enforcement

This code of ethics cannot anticipate every situation in which
personal interests may be in conflict with the interests of our
clients. You should be responsive to the spirit and intent of this
code of ethics as well as its specific provisions.

When any doubt exists regarding any code of ethics provision or
whether a conflict of interest with clients might exist, you should
discuss the transaction in advance with the Chief Compliance Officer
Timothy M. Fagan, (617-375-6205) or the Chief Legal Officer Susan
Newton (617-375-1702)). The code of ethics is designed to detect and
prevent fraud against clients and fund investors, and to avoid the
appearance of impropriety. If you feel inequitably burdened by any
policy, you should feel free to contact Timothy Fagan, Susan Newton or
the Compliance and Business Practices Committee. Exceptions may be
granted where warranted by applicable facts and circumstances. For
example, exemption for some Personal Trading Requirements may be
granted for transactions effected pursuant to an automatic investment
plan.

To provide assurance that policies are effective, the Investment
Compliance Department will monitor and check personal securities
transaction reports and certifications against fund portfolio
transactions. Additional administration and recordkeeping procedures
are described in Appendix E.

The Chief Compliance Officer has general administrative responsibility
for this code of ethics, and will administer procedures to review
personal trading reports. The Compliance and Business Practices
Committee of John Hancock Funds approves amendments to the code of
ethics and dispenses sanctions for violations of the code of ethics.
Accordingly, the Investment Compliance Department will refer
violations to the Complaince and Business Practices Committee for
review and appropriate action. The following factors will be
considered when the Compliance and Business Practices Committee
determines a fine or other disciplinary action:

o  the person's position and function (senior personnel may be held to
   a higher standard);

o  the amount of the trade;

o  whether the funds or accounts hold the security and were trading
   the same day;

o  whether the violation was by a family member.

o  whether the person has had a prior violation and which policy was
   involved.

o  whether the employee self-reported the violation.

You can request reconsideration of any disciplinary action by
submitting a written request to the Compliance and Business Practices
Committee.

No less frequently than annually, a written report of all material
violations and sanctions, significant conflicts of interest and other
related issues will be submitted to the boards of directors of the
John Hancock funds for their review. Sanctions for violations could
include fines, limitation of personal trading activity, suspension or
termination of the violator's position with John Hancock Funds and/or
a report to the appropriate regulatory authority.


13. Education of Employees

The Investment Compliance Department will provide a paper copy or
electronic version of the code of ethics (and any amendments) to each
person subject to this code of ethics. The Investment Compliance
Department will also administer training of employees on the
principles and procedures of the code of ethics.


Appendix A: Categories of Personnel

You have been notified about which of these categories applies to you,
based on the Investment Compliance Department's understanding of your
current role. If you have a level of investment access beyond that
category, or if you are promoted or change duties and as a result
should more appropriately be included in a different category, it is
your responsibility to immediately notify the Chief Compliance Officer
Timothy M. Fagan, (617-375-6205) or the Code of Ethics Administrator
Fredrick Spring (617-375-4987).


1)   Investment Access person: You are an Investment Access person
if you are an employee of John Hancock Advisers, LLC, a John Hancock
fund, or John Hancock Life Insurance Company or its subsidiaries who,
in connection with your regular functions or duties, makes or
participates in making recommendations regarding the purchase or sale
of securities by a John Hancock fund.

(examples: portfolio managers, analysts, traders)


2)   Regular Access person: You are a Regular Access person if you
do not fit the definition of Investment Access Person, but you do fit
one of the following two sub-categories:

o  You are an employee of John Hancock Advisers, LLC, a John Hancock
   fund or John Hancock Life Insurance Co. or its subsidiaries , or a
   director, officer (vice president and higher) or employee of John

   regarding any clients' purchase or sale of securities, or nonpublic
   information regarding the portfolio holdings of any reportable fund
   or who is involved in making securities recommendations to clients,
   or who has access to such recommendations that are nonpublic.

(examples: Investment Operations personnel, Investment Compliance
Department personnel, most Fund Financial Management personnel,
investment administrative personnel, Technology Resources personnel
with access to investment systems, attorneys and some legal
administration personnel)


3)   Non-Access person: You are a non-access person if you are an
employee of John Hancock Advisers, LLC, John Hancock Funds, LLC or a
John Hancock fund who does not fit the definitions of any of the other
three categories (Investment Access Person, Regular Access Person or
Limited Access Person). To be a non-access person, you must not
obtain information regarding the purchase or sale of securities by a
John Hancock fund or nonpublic information regarding the portfolio
holdings in connection with your regular functions or duties.

(examples: wholesalers, inside wholesalers, certain administrative
staff)


4)   Limited Access Person: Please see Appendix C for this
definition.


Appendix B: Preclearance Procedures

You should read the Code of Ethics to determine whether you must
obtain a preclearance before you enter into a securities transaction.
If you are required to obtain a preclearance, you should follow the
procedures detailed below.

1. Pre-clearance for Public Securities including Derivatives,
Futures, Options and Selling Short:

A request to pre-clear should be entered into the John Hancock
Personal Trading & Reporting System.

The John Hancock Personal Trading & Reporting System is located under
your Start Menu on your Desktop. It can be accessed by going to
Programs/Personal Trading & Reporting/ Personal Trading & Reporting
and by entering your Web Security Services user id and password.

If the John Hancock Personal Trading & Reporting System is not on your
Desktop, please contact the HELP Desk at (617) 572-6950 for
assistance.

The Trade Request Screen:

At times you may receive a message like "System is currently
unavailable". The system is scheduled to be offline from 8:00 PM until
7:00 AM each night.

[GRAPHIC: Trade Request Screen]

Ticker/Security Cusip: Fill in this one of these fields with the
proper information of the security you want to buy or sell. Then click
the [Lookup] button. Select one of the hyperlinks for the desired
security, and the system will populate the proper fields Ticker,
Security Cusip, Security Name and Security Type automatically on the
Trade Request Screen.

If You Don't Know the Ticker, Cusip, or Security Name:

If you do not know the full ticker, you may type in the first few
letters followed by an asterisk * and click the [Lookup] button. For
example, let's say you want to buy some shares of Intel, but all you
can remember of the ticker is that it begins with int, so you enter
int* for Ticker. If any tickers beginning with int are found, they are
displayed on a new screen. Select the hyperlink of the one you want,
and the system will populate Security Cusip, Security Name and
Security Type automatically on the Trade Request Screen. If you do not
know the full cusip, you may type in the first few numbers followed by
an asterisk * and click the [Lookup] button. For example, let's say
you want to buy some shares of Microsoft, but all you can remember of
the cusip is that it begins with 594918, so you enter 594918* for
Ticker. If any cusips beginning with 594918 are found, they are
displayed on a new screen. Select the hyperlink of the one you want,
and the system will fill in Ticker, Security Name and Security Type
automatically on the Trade Request Screen. If you do not know the
Ticker but have an idea of what the Security Name is, you may type in
an asterisk, a few letters of the name and an asterisk * and click the
[Lookup] button. For example, let's say you want to buy some shares of
American Brands, so you enter *amer* for Security Name. Any securities
whose names have amer in them are displayed on a new screen, where you
are asked to select the hyperlink of the one you want, and the system
will fill in Ticker, Cusip and Security Type automatically on the
Trade Request Screen.

Other Items on the Trade Request Screen:

Brokerage Account: Click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the
Brokerage Account field to choose the account to be used for the
trade.

Transaction Type: Choose one of the values displayed when you click
the dropdown arrow to the right of this field.

Trade Date: You may only submit trade requests for the current date.

Note: One or more of these fields may not appear on the Request Entry
screen if the information is not required. Required fields are
determined by the Investment Compliance Department.

Click the [Submit Request] button to send the trade request to your
Investment Compliance department.

Once you click the [Submit Request] button, you will be asked to
confirm the values you have entered. Review the information and click
the [Confirm] button if all the information is correct. After which,
you will receive immediate feedback in your web browser. (Note: We
suggest that you print out this confirmation and keep it as a record
of the trade you have made). After this, you can either submit another
trade request or logout.

Attention Investment Access Persons: If the system identifies a
potential violation of the Ban on Short Term Profits Rule, your
request will be sent to the Investment Compliance Department for
review and you will receive feedback via the e-mail system.

Starting Over:

To clear everything on the screen and start over, click the [Clear
Screen] button.

Exiting Without Submitting the Trade Request:

If you decide not to submit the trade request before clicking the
[Submit Request] button, simply exit from the browser by clicking the
[X] button on the upper right or by pressing [Alt+F4], or by clicking
the Logout hyperlink on the lower left side of the screen.

Ticker/Security Name Lookup Screen:

You arrive at this screen from the Trade Request Screen, where you've
clicked the [Lookup] button (see above, "If You Don't Know the Ticker,
Cusip, or Security Name"). If you see the security you want to trade,
you simply select its corresponding hyperlink, and you will
automatically return to the Trade Request Screen, where you finish
making your trade request. If the security you want to trade is not
shown, that means that it is not recognized by the system under the
criteria you used to look it up. Keep searching under other names
(click the [Return to Request] button) until you are sure that the
security is not in the system. If you determine that the desired
security is not in the system, please contact a member of the
Investment Compliance department to add the security for you. Contacts
are listed below:

Fred Spring x54987

Adding Brokerage Accounts:

To access this functionality, click on the Add Brokerage Account
hyperlink on the left frame of your browser screen. You will be
prompted to enter the Brokerage Account Number, Brokerage Account
Name, Date Opened, and Broker. When you click the [Create New
Brokerage Account] button, you will receive a message that informs you

[GRAPHIC: Add Brokerage Account screen]


3. Pre-clearance for Private Placements and Initial Public Offerings:

You may request a preclearance of private placement securities or an
Initial Public Offering by contacting Fred Spring via Microsoft
Outlook (please "cc." Tim Fagan on all such requests). Please keep in
mind that the code of ethics prohibits Investment Access persons from
purchasing securities in an initial public offering.

The request must include:

|_| the associate's name;

|_| the associate's John Hancock Funds' company;

|_| the complete name of the security;

|_| the seller and whether or not the seller is one with whom the
    associate does business on a regular basis;

|_| any potential conflict, present or future, with fund trading activity
    and whether the security might be offered as inducement to later
    recommend publicly traded securities for any fund; and

|_| the date of the request.

Clearance of private placements or initial public offerings may be
denied if the transaction could create the appearance of impropriety.
Clearance of initial public offerings will also be denied if the
transaction is prohibited for a person due to his or her access
category under the code of ethics.


Appendix C: Limited Access Persons

There are two types of Limited Access Persons-(1) Certain directors of
the Adviser and (2) the Independent Trustees/Directors of the Funds.

(1) Certain Directors of the Adviser:

You are a Limited Access person if you are a director of John Hancock
Advisers, LLC or Sovereign Asset Management Co. and you meet the three
following criteria:

(a) you are not also an officer of John Hancock Advisers, LLC,
Sovereign Asset Management Co. or a John Hancock fund;

(b) you do not have access to nonpublic information regarding any
clients' purchase or sale of securities, or nonpublic information
regarding the portfolio holdings of any John Hancock fund or account;
and

(c) you are not involved in making securities recommendations to
clients and do not have access to such recommendations that are
nonpublic.

(examples: directors of John Hancock Advisers, LLC or Sovereign Asset
Management Co. who are not involved in the daily operations of the
adviser)

If you are a Limited Access Person who fits this definition, the
following policies apply to your category. These policies are
described in detail in the code of ethics.

o  General principles

o  Inside information policy and procedures

o  Broker letter/Duplicate Confirms

o  Initial/annual holdings reports

o  Quarterly transaction reports

o  Annual recertification

Preclearance requirement LIMITED: You only need to preclear any
direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership in any security
in an initial public offering (an IPO) or in a limited offering (i.e.
a private placement). To request preclearance of these securities,
contact Timothy Fagan at tfagan@jhancock.com and/or Fredrick Spring at
fspring@jhancock.com.

- ---------------

*A Limited Access Person may complete this requirement under the code
of ethics of another Manulife/John Hancock adviser or fund by the
applicable regulatory deadlines and arrange for copies of the required
information to be sent to the John Hancock Funds Compliance
Department.

- ---------------

(2) The Independent Trustees/Directors of the Funds: If you are an
independent trustee/director to a John Hancock fund (i.e. not an
"interested person" of the fund within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940), the following policies apply to your category.
These policies are described in detail in the code of ethics.

o  General principles

o  Annual recertification

o  Quarterly transaction report, but only if you knew (or should have
   known) that during the 15 calendar days before or after you trade a
   security, either:

(i) a John Hancock fund purchased or sold the same security, or

(ii) a John Hancock fund or John Hancock Advisers, LLC considered
purchasing or selling the same security.

This policy applies to holdings in your personal accounts, those of a
spouse, "significant other" or family members sharing your household,
as well as all accounts over which you have discretion or give advice
or information. If this situation occurs, it is your responsibility
to contact Timothy M. Fagan, Chief Compliance Officer, at (617)
375-6205 and he will assist you with the requirements of the quarterly
transaction report.

This means that the independent trustees of the funds will not usually
be required to file a quarterly transaction report-they are only
required to file in the situation described above.


Appendix D: Subadvisers

Each subadviser to a John Hancock fund is subject to its own code of
ethics, which must meet the requirements of Rule 17j-1 and Rule
204A-1.

Approval of Code of Ethics

Each subadviser to a John Hancock fund must provide a copy of its code
of ethics to the trustees of the relevant John Hancock funds for
approval initially and within 60 calendar days of any material
amendment. The trustees will give their approval if they determine
that the code:

o  contains provisions reasonably necessary to prevent the
   subadviser's Access Persons (as defined in Rule 17j-1) from
   engaging in any conduct prohibited by Rule 17j-1;

o  requires the subadviser's Access Persons to make reports to at
   least the extent required in Rule 17j-1(d);

o  requires the subadviser to institute appropriate procedures for
   review of these reports by management or compliance personnel (as
   contemplated by Rule 17j-1(d)(3));

o  provides for notification of the subadviser's Access Persons in
   accordance with Rule 17j-1(d)(4); and

o  requires the subadviser's Access Persons who are Investment
   Personnel to obtain the pre-clearances required by Rule 17j-1(e);

Reports and Certifications

Each subadviser must provide an annual report and certification to
John Hancock Advisers, LLC and the fund's trustees in accordance with
Rule 17j-1(c)(2)(ii). The subadviser must also provide other reports
or information that John Hancock Advisers, LLC may reasonably request.

Recordkeeping Requirements

The subadviser must maintain all records for its Access Persons as
required by Rule 17j-1(f).


Appendix E: Administration and Recordkeeping

Adoption and Approval

The trustees of a John Hancock fund must approve the code of ethics of
an adviser, subadviser or affiliated principal underwriter before
initially retaining its services.

Any material change to a code of ethics of a John Hancock fund, John
Hancock Funds, LLC, John Hancock Advisers, LLC or a subadviser to a
fund must be approved by the trustees of the John Hancock fund,
including a majority of trustees who are not interested persons, no
later than six months after adoption of the material change.

Administration

No less frequently than annually, John Hancock Funds, LLC, John
Hancock Advisers, LLC, each subadviser and each John Hancock fund will
furnish to the trustees of each John Hancock fund a written report
that:

o  describes issues that arose during the previous year under the code of
   ethics or the related procedures, including, but not limited to,
   information about material code or procedure violations, and

o  certifies that each entity has adopted procedures reasonably necessary
   to prevent its access persons from violating its code of ethics.

Recordkeeping

The Investment Compliance Department will maintain:

ANNEX A

General Criteria

1.  Nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence
to high ethical standards.

2.  Nominees should have demonstrated business acumen, experience and
ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current
and long-term objectives of the Fund(s) and should be willing and able to
contribute positively to the decision-making process of the Fund(s).

3.  Nominees should have a commitment to understand the Fund(s), and the
responsibilities of a Trustee/Director of an investment company and to
regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its
committees.

4.  Nominees should have the ability to understand the sometimes
conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the Fund, including
shareholders and the management company, and to act in the interests of all
shareholders.

5.  Nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest
that would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all
the shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director/trustee.

6.  Nominees shall not be discriminated against on the basis of race,
religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other
basis proscribed by law.  The value of diversity on the Board should be
considered.

Application of Criteria to Existing

The renomination of existing Trustees should not be viewed as automatic,
but should be based on continuing qualification under the criteria set
forth above.  In addition, the Administrative Committee shall consider the
existing trustees' performance on the Board and any committee.

Review of Shareholder Nominations

Any shareholder recommendation must be submitted in compliance with all of
the pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 to be considered by the Administration Committee.  In evaluating a
nominee recommended by a shareholder, the Administration Committee, in
addition to the criteria discussed above, may consider the objectives of
the shareholder in submitting that nomination and whether such objectives
are consistent with the interests of all shareholders.  If the Board
determines to include a shareholder's candidate among the slate of
nominees, the candidate's name will be placed on the Fund's proxy card.  If
the Administration Committee or the Board determines not to include such
candidate among the Board's designated nominees and the shareholder has
satisfied the requirements of Rule 14a-8, the shareholder's candidate will
be treated as a nominee of the shareholder who originally nominated the
candidate.  In that case, the candidate will not be named on the proxy card
distributed with the Fund's proxy statement.

As long as an existing Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of the
Administration Committee, to satisfy the criteria listed above, the
Committee generally would favor the re-nomination of an existing Trustee
rather than a new candidate.  Consequently, while the Administration
Committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as
trustees, the Administration Committee may only act upon such
recommendations if there is a vacancy on the Board or the Administration
Committee determines that the selection of a new or additional Independent
Trustee is in the best interests of the Fund.  In the event that a vacancy
arises or a change in Board membership is determined to be advisable, the
Administration Committee will, in addition to any shareholder
recommendations, consider candidates identified by other means, including
candidates proposed by members of the Administration Committee.  While it
has not done so in the past, the Administration Committee may retain a
consultant to assist the Committee in a search for a qualified candidate.

Communications from Shareholders

Shareholders may communicate with the members of the Board as a group or
individually.  Any such communication should be sent to the Board or an
individual Trustee c/o the secretary of the Fund at the address on the
notice of this meeting.  The Secretary may determine not to forward any
letter to the members of the Board that does not relate to the business of
the Fund.
