CHAIRMAN'S REPORT (UNAUDITED)

      ASA Limited  ("ASA")  relocated  from the  Republic of South Africa to the
Commonwealth  of Bermuda by  reorganizing  itself  into a newly  formed  company
incorporated in Bermuda,  ASA (Bermuda)  Limited (the "Company") on November 19,
2004. As a result of the reorganization, shareholders of ASA became shareholders
of the Company.

      Shares of the Company  commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange at
the opening of trading on Monday,  November 22, 2004.  The ticker  symbol,  ASA,
remains the same.

      The Directors,  investment  policies and service  providers of the Company
are the same as those of its  predecessor,  ASA. Mr. Ronald McCarthy has retired
as an officer  but will  remain as a director  and will be engaged in winding up
ASA's  affairs  in South  Africa,  including  the  closing  of ASA's  office  in
Johannesburg  during 2005.  The executive  offices of the Company are located in
Buffalo,  New York.  Shareholder  services  will  continue to be provided by LGN
Associates in Florham Park, New Jersey.

      The  financial  statements  for the fiscal year ended  November  30, 2004,
reflect the results of operations of ASA through  November 19, 2004 (the closing
date of the reorganization) and the results of operations of the Company for the
period November 20, 2004 through November 30, 2004.

      The financial statements are reported in United States dollars. (See Notes
(l)B and (1)F to the financial  statements for additional  information.) As used
in this report, "Company" refers to ASA (Bermuda) Limited and, where applicable,
ASA Limited.

      At November 30, 2004 the  Company's  net asset value was $49.95 per share.
The closing  price of the  Company's  stock was $44.82 per share at November 30,
2004, which  represented a 10.3% discount to the net asset value.  This compares
with the net asset value of $51.54 per share at November  30, 2003 at which time
the closing price was $47.16, a discount of 8.5% to the net asset value.

      Net investment income for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2004 was $.22
per share,  as compared to $.84 per share for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2003.  Realized  gains from  investments  for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2004 were $.73 per share.  There were no realized  gains (losses) for the fiscal
year  ended  November  30,  2003.  Net  realized  loss  from  foreign   currency
transactions was ($.68) per share for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2004 as
compared  to a gain of $.32 per share for the  fiscal  year ended  November  30,
2003.

      Dividends  totaling  $.55 per share in U.S.  currency were paid during the
fiscal year ended  November  30,  2004.  For the fiscal year ended  November 30,
2003,  the  total  dividend  payments  were $.80 per  share.  (See  Certain  tax
information  for  United  States  shareholders  (pages  14 and 15)  for  further
comments.)

THE GOLD BULLION MARKET

      The dollar price of gold  continued  to hold the  positive  levels of 2003
during 2004, reaching a price peak of US$ 456.89 per ounce - a 16 year high. The
price averaged US$ 406 per ounce for the eleven months to November 2004, up from
an average  US$ 363 per ounce  during  2003.  There are a number of  fundamental
factors that should lend support to the gold price.  The first of these  relates
to official  gold sales.  The Central  Bank Gold  Agreement  of 1999 was renewed
during 2004 for another five years. This should be positive for sentiment, as it
reintroduces  a degree of  certainty  into the  official  source of gold supply.
Under  this  agreement,  total  gold sales may not exceed 500 tons per year or a
total of 2500 tons for the five-year duration of the agreement.  The limit under
the  previous  agreement  was 400 tons per annum or 2000 tons in total  over the
five-year period.  This additional tonnage is a small percentage of total annual
gold traded and could be absorbed  without causing  excessive  disruption to the
gold market.

      Furthermore,  the  market is  expecting  official  gold sales to fall as a
percentage of total supply. The leasing arrangements of the old agreement remain
in force under the renewed  agreement.  France and Germany have stated that they
intend  to sell up to 1200  tons of gold  during  the life  span of the  current
agreement.  The Bank of England is no longer party to this agreement, as the BOE
is not intending to sell gold during this time period. Fabrication demand in the
first half of 2004 was robust and the market is expecting  that demand to remain
strong in the second half. Jewelry  fabrication rose in China, India and Turkey,
as a result of sustained economic growth.

      This year saw the  listing in both  Johannesburg  and New York of the long
awaited  gold  certificate  securities  which trade like  exchange  traded funds
(ETF). They join the one already listed in Australia.  These  securities,  which
represent 1/100 (1/10 in New York) of one fine troy ounce of gold, are backed by
actual  bullion held in safe  custody.  These  instruments  allow the retail and
institutional  investor to gain  exposure to the domestic  price of gold without
the costs of holding  coins or bar.  It is  expected  that these ETFs will raise
both the public  awareness of the  investment  potential of the metal and demand
for it.

      Producers  continue  to  de-hedge.  In the  first  half of the  year,  the
producers  cut hedge  positions by a fraction  over 200 tons.  The producers are
reducing  their hedge  positions as a strategic  objective,  a trend that should
continue while the gold price is strong. This acts as a sizable source of demand
for gold.

      Mine  output  has been under  pressure,  although  there are new  projects
coming on stream that should lead to rising  global  output next year.  However,
strong  domestic  currencies  relative to the US dollar are placing  pressure on
production  costs,  which could lead to  rationalization  of production in South
Africa, Australia and Canada in particular.

THE GOLD SHARE MARKET

      Unfortunately,  the strong  rand/dollar  exchange rate,  coupled with high
cost inflation on the mines, reduced any benefits of a higher dollar gold price,
with the South  African  producers  experiencing  a rand gold  price that was 4%
lower than last year. The FTSE/JSE Gold Mining Index at the end of November 2004
was 25% lower than a year earlier.  In dollar terms, the AngloGold Ashanti share
price declined 16%,  Harmony fell 33%, while Gold Fields ended the period up 3%.
These last two shares are, of course, also responding to the potential corporate
action.  Operationally,  the South African gold producers are putting strategies
in place to cope with the stronger rand environment.

<PAGE>

      The  performance  of the North  American  producers,  as  measured  by the
Philadelphia  Gold and Silver  Index (XAU),  was  surprisingly  unexciting  with
almost no change to the index compared to a year earlier.

THE GOLD MINING INDUSTRY

      Corporate  activity  continues to be a feature of the South African mining
sector, with consolidation of the industry continuing. AngloGold concluded their
merger with  Ashanti to form  AngloGold  Ashanti.  Gold  Fields  failed in their
attempt to merge their offshore assets with IAMGOLD, while the recent feature of
the industry has been Harmony's acrimonious hostile bid for Gold Fields.

THE PLATINUM INDUSTRY

      The platinum price rose by 6% during 2004, and at the end of November 2004
was trading at US$ 865 per ounce.  The price  reached a 24-year  peak of US$ 937
per ounce in April.  Supply and demand is  expected  to be in balance  for 2004.
Demand for platinum  for auto  catalysts is expected to rise due to higher sales
of diesel cars in Europe coupled with tighter emission limits. Industrial demand
for platinum  should rise, but jewelry  demand is expected to soften.  Supply is
expected to grow,  thereby  providing  sufficient metal to meet demand. In 2005,
continued supply growth could push the market into surplus,  a position not seen
for several years.  As a result,  the platinum price is unlikely to maintain its
current  heady  level.  A lower  platinum  price  relative  to an even  stronger
rand/dollar  exchange rate could lead to pressure on producer profits.  Over the
year, AngloAmerican Platinum's share price dropped 20% and Impala fell 9%.

      The South African draft Mineral and Petroleum Royalty Bill, which outlines
the royalties to be paid by various mineral related  industries,  was introduced
last year and was expected to have been passed during 2004. The mining  industry
contended  that a royalty based on revenue,  without taking  profitability  into
account,  could damage the  industry.  Furthermore,  excessive  royalties  would
decrease the attractiveness of mining and could deter mining related investment.
Government is currently  evaluating  industry  feedback and plans to publish the
royalty bill during the first half of 2005.

HIV/AIDS

      One of the major issues  confronting  the South African Mining Industry is
HIV/AIDS. At present, it is estimated that five million out of 45 million people
in South  Africa  are  infected  with the virus.  Infection  rates in the mining
industry tend to be worse than the national average at 20% to 30% according to a
survey  conducted by the South  African  Business  Coalition on HIV and AIDS. As
such, the mining  industry is expected to be adversely  affected by the illness.
On the positive side, however,  the mining industry leads the nation in terms of
managing  the  effects  of  HIV/AIDS,  with most of the major  mining  companies
instituting  health and welfare  policies  aimed at  reducing  the impact of the
disease on operations while also improving the quality of life of the infected.

PORTFOLIO MOVEMENTS

      The ongoing  concentration  by the gold mining  industry to meet the South
African  Government's  call to assimilate Black Economic  Empowerment (BEE) into
all spheres of the  economy  has  spawned the  creation of a new BEE gold mining
company under the name of Mvelaphanda Resources Limited. A small holding in this
company was acquired during the year.

      The holding in Avgold  Limited  was  increased  during the year.  However,
Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited completed a successful merger with Avgold on
a one for ten share issue basis,  thus  continuing  the  rationalization  taking
place in the South African gold mining industry.  The Company also decreased its
holding in Gold Fields Limited by a small amount.

THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

      The overarching economic variable, from a South African mineral producer's
perspective,  is the  rand/dollar  exchange  rate.  During 2004,  the rand hit a
six-year high against the dollar of 5.7083 per US$.

      It is clear from a comparison of the gain of other currencies  against the
US$ so far in 2004 that the rand's 12% rise is due not just to the US$  weakness
but to specific rand demand. For example, that other "commodity based currency,"
the Australian  dollar, is up just 1% against the US$ in the same period.  South
African  mining   companies  have  largely  blamed  the  strong  rand  for  poor
profitability.  Recent  reports,  however,  indicate that South  African  export
manufacturers  are also  suffering  and  large-scale  closures of  manufacturing
capacity have been reported. This is not a uniquely South African phenomenon, as
similar  complaints  about the weak dollar have been  emanating  from Europe and
Japan.  Notably,  the euro has also just traded at a multi-year high against the
dollar as the US current account deficit rose to record levels.

      A  positive  development  on the  economic  front in South  Africa was the
announcement of a further  relaxation of exchange controls in the second half of
2004.  Companies are no longer subject to foreign  investment  limits,  but will
still require official approval for investments. In theory, South African mining
companies  can now  invest  offshore  without  limit  as  long  as the  intended
investment passes muster with the authorities.

      Economic  growth seems to be  gathering  momentum in South Africa as third
quarter GDP growth exceeded  expectations.  The economy grew at 5.6% (quarter on
quarter  annualized)  up from 4.5% in the  second  quarter.  This high  level of
growth may cause the South  African  Reserve Bank to delay any further rate cuts
as fears that an overheating  economy could rekindle  inflation.  Apart from the
unexpected rate cut in August, the Reserve Bank has resisted calls for rate cuts
to weaken the currency.

DIVIDENDS AND EARNINGS

      The  squeeze  on  earnings  and  dividends  as a result of  exchange  rate
pressures and rising costs has especially  affected the South African producers.
Reflecting  this squeeze the Company's 2004 net investment  income was only $.22
per share,  significantly lower than the $.84 per share in 2003 and the $.85 per
share in 2002. Thus, the total dividend payment


                                                                               3
<PAGE>

of $.55 per share paid in 2004 exceeded investment income  significantly and yet
compared unfavorably with the $.80 per share dividend paid in 2003.

      Other factors are  influencing  the lower dividend payout of the companies
in the portfolio. In recent years gold mining has been concentrated in fewer and
larger   companies.   These   companies  tend  to  deploy  their  earnings  into
diversification,  exploration and development  rather than into dividends as was
the practice of the industry in the past.

THE COMPANY'S TAX STATUS

      As noted in past  reports,  ASA was  successful  in  convincing  the South
African  Parliament to pass special  legislation  extending  its exemption  from
certain taxes until November 30, 2004.

      As a result,  ASA  persisted  in its efforts to move from South  Africa to
Bermuda to avoid the imposition of certain South African taxes and completed its
reorganization as a Bermuda company as of November 19, 2004.

      The successful completion of the reorganization prior to November 30, 2004
allowed the Company to eliminate the deferred  South  African  capital gains tax
liability of  approximately  $1.00 per share at the date of the  reorganization.
However, this benefit was reduced by approximately $.09 per share for an accrual
of South African  transfer  taxes payable by the Company in connection  with the
transaction. (See Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements.)

CERTAIN INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS (UNAUDITED)

The following is a summary of certain of the Company's  investment  policies and
restrictions  and is subject to the more  complete  statements  contained in the
Company's Bye-Laws and Registration Statement under the United States Investment
Company Act of 1940, each as amended:

1. To invest over 50% of the value of its total  assets in the common  shares or
securities convertible into common shares of companies conducting,  as the major
portion of their business, gold mining and related activities in the Republic of
South Africa.  It is expected that most of such  companies will have reached the
production  stage.  The balance of the Company's total assets,  other than minor
amounts  which may be held in cash,  may (i) be  invested  in  common  shares or
securities convertible into common shares of companies engaged in other business
of varied  types in the  Republic of South  Africa,  (ii) be held in the form of
gold bullion or  certificates of deposit  therefor to be purchased,  directly or
indirectly, with South African rand (provided that the Company's holdings in the
form of gold bullion or certificates  of deposit  therefor may not exceed 25% of
the value of the  Company's  total  assets)  and/or  (iii) be invested in common
shares or  securities  convertible  into common  shares of  companies  primarily
engaged  outside of South Africa in extractive  or related  industries or in the
holding or development of real estate (provided that the Company's investment in
such  companies may not exceed 20% of the value of the Company's  total assets).
If investment considerations warrant, the Company may deviate from the foregoing
to the extent it  temporarily  holds its  assets in cash,  cash  equivalents  or
securities  issued  or  guaranteed  by the  Government  of South  Africa  or any
instrumentality thereof (South African Government Securities).

2. Not to invest in securities,  except South African Government Securities,  of
any  issuer  if as a result  over 20 per cent in  value of the  Company's  total
assets would at the time be invested in securities of such issuer  provided that
no more than 40 per cent of the  Company's  assets would at the time be invested
in securities of companies, each of which exceeds 10 per cent of such value.

3. Not to invest in securities of any class of any issuer  (except South African
Government  Securities) if as a result the Company would at the time own over 10
per cent of such securities outstanding.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of
Directors of ASA (Bermuda) Limited:

      We have audited the  accompanying  statements of assets and liabilities of
ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited  (prior to November 20, 2004 ASA Limited) as of November
30, 2004 and 2003,  including  the schedule of  investments,  as of November 30,
2004,  and the  related  statements  of  operations,  surplus and changes in net
assets,  and  supplementary  information for each of the two years in the period
ended  November 30, 2004,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the three
years in the  period  ended  November  30,  2004.  These  financial  statements,
financial  highlights,  and supplementary  information are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements,  financial highlights, and supplementary information based
on our  audits.  The  financial  highlights  for the  years  presented  prior to
November 30, 2002 were audited by other auditors who have ceased  operations and
whose report dated December 18, 2001  expressed an unqualified  opinion on those
financial highlights.

      We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial statements,  financial highlights,  and supplementary  information are
free of material  misstatement.  An audit includes  examining,  on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
financial  highlights,  and supplementary  information.  Our procedures included
confirmation  of  securities  owned  as  of  November  30,  2004  and  2003,  by
correspondence  with the custodian and others. An audit also includes  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our  opinion,  the  financial  statements,  financial  highlights,  and
supplementary  information referred to above, and audited by us, present fairly,
in all material respects,  the financial position of ASA (Bermuda) Limited as of
November  30, 2004 and 2003,  and the results of its  operations,  its  surplus,
changes in its net assets,  and  supplementary  information  for each of the two
years in the period then ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the
three years in the period then ended in conformity with U.S.  generally accepted
accounting principles.

                                                    New York, N.Y., U.S.A.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended November 30, 2004 and 2003

1  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited  (the
"Company") is a closed-end  management  investment  company registered under the
United States  Investment  Company Act of 1940, and was organized as an exempted
limited  liability  company  under the laws of  Bermuda  on April 29,  2003.  On
November  19,  2004,  the  Company,   pursuant  to  an  Agreement  and  Plan  of
Reorganization,  the ("Reorganization")  acquired all the assets and assumed all
the liabilities of ASA Limited ("ASA"),  a South Africa public limited liability
company.  The  following is a summary of the  Company's  significant  accounting
policies:

A. INVESTMENTS

Portfolio  securities  are generally  valued at the last reported sales price on
the last  trading  day of the  period,  or the mean  between the closing bid and
asked prices of those  securities  not traded on that date.  In the event that a
mean price  cannot be  computed  due to the  absence of either a bid or an asked
price,  then the bid price plus 1% or the ask price less 1%, as  applicable,  is
used.  Securities for which current market  quotations are not readily available
are valued at their fair value as  determined in good faith by, or in accordance
with procedures adopted by, the Company's Board of Directors.

The  difference  between cost and current  value is reflected  separately as net
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.  The net realized gain or
loss from the sale of securities is determined  for  accounting  purposes on the
identified cost basis.

There is no assurance that the valuation at which the Company's  investments are
carried could be realized upon sale.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio  securities  and other assets and  liabilities  denominated in foreign
currencies  are  translated  into U.S.  dollar  amounts at the  closing  rate of
exchange on the date of valuation.  Purchases and sales of investment securities
and income and expense items  denominated  in foreign  currencies are translated
into U.S.  dollar  amounts on the  respective  dates of such  transactions.  The
resulting  net foreign  currency  gain or loss is included in the  statement  of
operations.

C. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

During  the year  ended  November  30,  2004  sales of  securities  amounted  to
$8,403,634 and purchases of securities  amounted to $7,292,714.  During the year
ended  November  30, 2003 there were no sales of  securities  and  purchases  of
securities amounted to $5,296,118.

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend  date, net of withholding  taxes,
if any. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

The reporting for financial  statement purposes of distributions made during the
fiscal year from net  investment  income or net  realized  gains may differ from
their  ultimate  reporting for United States  federal  income tax purposes.  The
differences  are  caused  primarily  by the  separate  line item  reporting  for
financial  statement  purposes of foreign exchange gains or losses. See pages 14
and 15 for additional tax information for United States shareholders.

E. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States  requires  management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements are presented in United States dollars.

Certain prior year amounts in the  accompanying  financial  statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

2 TAX STATUS OF THE  COMPANY  Pursuant to the South  African  Income Tax Act, as
amended, the Company prior to the Reorganization was subject to tax on dividends
received from sources other than South Africa.  In addition,  beginning with the
fiscal year ended  November 30, 2002, the Company was subject to tax on interest
earned on cash deposits.  A tax benefit for South African taxes of $40,457 and a
tax provision of $294,986 for these items have been included in the accompanying
financial  statements  for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2004 and November
30, 2003, respectively.

The deferred tax liability of $8,616,587, which had been included for the tax on
unrealized  capital gains on securities  for the fiscal year ended  November 30,
2003, was eliminated as a result of the Reorganization.

In addition,  the Company had previously  provided for and paid taxes on foreign
exchange gains.  However,  the Company was assessed by the South African Revenue
Service  ("SARS") on the basis that it was exempt  from tax on foreign  exchange
gains, and in November 2003, after the completion of a refund audit performed by
SARS, the Company  received a refund in respect of the overpayment of tax in the
amount of $1,639,641, plus interest.

3 RETIREMENT  PLANS Effective  April 1, 1989, the Company  established a defined
contribution  plan (the "Plan") to replace its previous  pension plan.  The Plan
covers all full-time employees.  The Company will contribute 15% of each covered
employee's  salary to the Plan.  The Plan provides for immediate  vesting by the
employee  without  regard to length of service.  During the years ended November
30,  2004  and  2003  there  were no  covered  employees  under  the  plan  and,
consequently, no retirement expense was incurred.


                                                                              11
<PAGE>

In 1994, the Company entered into a supplemental non-qualified pension agreement
with its  Chairman.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  the  Company  agreed to
credit  $25,000  per year for five  years,  beginning  December  1,  1993,  to a
Supplemental Pension Account with interest credited at an annual rate of 3.5%.

The Board of Directors  approved an increase in the amount of the annual  credit
as follows: $28,125 in May 1999; $31,250 in February 2002, $45,000 in March 2003
and $55,000 in February  2004.  As a result,  the Company has  recorded  expense
amounts of  $53,333  and  $41,562  for the years  ended  November  30,  2004 and
November 30, 2003, respectively.

The Company has recorded an asset in the amount of $150,750,  ($145,000 in 2003)
related to the  retirement  obligation  liability of $385,635 as of November 30,
2004,  ($315,900 in 2003). The $385,635  represents the total liability  payable
under the agreement at November 30, 2004. Upon retirement from the Company,  the
liability  under the agreement is payable in ten (10)  consecutive  equal annual
payments to the Chairman.

4 COMPANY  REORGANIZATION  The  following  table  illustrates  the effect on the
authorized number of shares, par value, and share premium (capital surplus) as a
result of the Reorganization:

           Share premium
           (capital surplus)        27,489,156                21,249,156
                                 -------------             -------------
           Total                 $  30,849,156             $  30,849,156
                                 =============             =============

As a result of the Reorganization,  the net asset value per share of the Company
as of the close of business on November 19, 2004 increased  approximately  $0.91
per share due to the  elimination  of the deferred tax  liability  for potential
South  African  capital  gains  taxes  on the  books  of ASA  in the  amount  of
$9,613,374 ($1.00 per share), reduced by an accrual of $832,015 ($.09 per share)
for  South   African   taxes   payable  by  the  Company  as  a  result  of  the
Reorganization.

In connection with the  Reorganization,  the Company has incurred  $2,447,747 in
expenses through November 30, 2004. These amounts are recorded in the statements
of operations for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003
in the following classifications:

                                                 November 30

                                       ==========            ========

5  CONCENTRATION RISK  Under  normal  circumstances,  over 50% of the  Company's
assets will be invested in equity securities of companies conducting, as a major
portion of their business,  gold mining and related  activities in South Africa.
The Company also invests in securities of companies  engaged in other businesses
in South Africa, including the mining of other precious metals. In addition, the
Company  invests a portion of its assets in  securities  of companies  operating
outside of South Africa in extractive  and related  activities,  including  gold
mining.  The Company is,  therefore,  subject to gold and precious metal related
risks as well as risks related to investing in South Africa including political,
economic,  regulatory,  currency  fluctuation  and foreign  exchange risks. As a
result of industry consolidation, the Company currently is invested in a limited
number of  securities  and thus holds  large  positions  in certain  securities.
Because  the  Company's  investments  are  concentrated  in a limited  number of
securities of companies involved in the mining of gold and other precious metals
and  related  activities,  the net asset  value of the Company may be subject to
greater volatility than that of a more broadly diversified investment company.

6  COMMITMENTS  The Company has a lease for office  space in  Johannesburg  that
expires  in  February  2005.  The  remaining   commitment  under  the  lease  is
approximately $15,000.

CERTAIN TAX INFORMATION FOR
UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)

From  December 1, 1963 through  November 30, 1987,  the Company was treated as a
"foreign  investment  company"  for United  States  federal  income tax purposes
pursuant to Section 1246 of the Internal  Revenue Code.  Under that  section,  a
United States  shareholder  who has held his shares in the Company for more than
one year is subject to tax at  ordinary  income tax rates on his profit (if any)
on a sale of his shares to the extent of his  "ratable  share" of the  Company's
earnings  and  profits  accumulated  for the period  during  which he held those
shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987.  If such  shareholder's
profit on the sale of his  shares  exceeds  such  ratable  share and he held his
shares for more than one year,  then,  subject to the discussion below regarding
the United States  federal  income tax rules  applicable to taxable years of the
Company  beginning  after  November 30, 1987,  he is subject to tax at long-term
capital gain rates on the excess.

      The Company's per share earnings and profits  accumulated  (undistributed)
in each of the  taxable  years from 1964  through  1987 is given below in United
States currency.  All the per share amounts give effect to the two-for-one stock
splits that became effective on May 10, 1966, May 10, 1973 and May 9, 1975.

      Under rules  enacted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  the Company  became a
"passive foreign investment  company" (a "PFIC") on December 1, 1987. The manner
in which these rules apply  depends on whether a United States  shareholder  (1)
elects to treat the Company as a qualified electing fund ("QEF") with respect to
his  Company  shares,  (2) for  taxable  years  of a United  States  shareholder
beginning after December 31, 1997, elects to "mark-to-market" his Company shares
as of the close of each taxable year, or (3) makes neither election.

      In general,  if a United States  shareholder  of the Company does NOT make
either such election, any gain realized on the direct or indirect disposition of
his  Company  shares  will be treated as  ordinary  income.  In  addition,  such
shareholder will be subject to an "interest charge" on part of his tax liability
with  respect  to  such  gain,  as  well  as with  respect  to  certain  "excess
distributions" made by the Company. Furthermore, shares held by such shareholder
may be denied the benefit of any otherwise  applicable  increase in tax basis at
death.  Under  proposed  regulations,  a  "disposition"  would  include  a  U.S.
taxpayer's becoming a nonresident alien.

      As  noted,  the  general  tax  consequences  described  in  the  preceding
paragraph apply to an "excess  distribution" on Company shares, which is defined
as a  distribution  by the Company for a taxable  year that is more than 125% of
the average amount it distributed for the three preceding taxable years.* If the
Company  makes an  excess  distribution  in a  taxable  year,  a  United  States
shareholder who has not made a QEF or mark-to-market  election would be required
to allocate the excess  amount  ratably over the ENTIRE  holding  period for his
shares.  That  allocation  would  result in tax  being  payable  at the  highest
applicable  rate in the prior years to which the  distribution  is allocated and
interest charges being imposed on the resulting  "underpayment" of taxes made in
those years.  In contrast,  a  distribution  that is not an excess  distribution
would be taxable to a United States  shareholder as a normal dividend,** with no
interest charge.

      If a United States  shareholder  elects to treat the Company as a QEF with
respect to his  shares  therein  for the first  year he holds his shares  during
which the Company is a PFIC (or who later makes the QEF election and also elects
to treat his shares  generally  as if they were sold for their fair market value
on the first  day of the first  taxable  year of the  Company  for which the QEF
election  is  effective),  the  rules  described  in  the  preceding  paragraphs
generally will not apply.  Instead,  the electing United States shareholder will
include  annually  in his  gross  income  his PRO RATA  share  of the  Company's
ordinary  earnings  and net capital  gain (his "QEF"  inclusion)  regardless  of
whether  such  income  or  gain  was  actually  distributed.   A  United  States
shareholder who makes a valid QEF election

- ----------
* For example,  the Company made annual distributions of $.80, $.80 and $.80 per
share  during  the  taxable  years  ended  November  30,  2003,  2002 and  2001,
respectively,   an  average  per  year  of  $.80  per  share.  Accordingly,  any
distribution  in excess of $1.00 per share (125% of $.80) would be treated as an
excess  distribution  for the taxable year ended November 30, 2004. (All amounts
in U.S. currency.)

** Because the Company is a PFIC, dividends it pays will not qualify for the 15%
maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on dividends that individuals receive.

will recognize  capital gain on any profit from the actual sale of his shares if
those  shares  were  held  as  capital  assets,  except  to  the  extent  of the
shareholder's  ratable  share  of  the  earnings  and  profits  of  the  Company
accumulated for the period during which he held those shares between December 1,
1963 and November 30, 1987, as described above.

      Alternatively,  if a United States  shareholder  makes the  mark-to-market
election with respect to Company shares for taxable years  beginning on or after
January  1, 1998,  such  shareholder  will be  required  annually  to report any
unrealized  gain  with  respect  to his  shares  as  ordinary  income,  and  any
unrealized  loss would be permitted as an ordinary  loss, but only to the extent
of previous inclusions of ordinary income. Any gain subsequently realized by the
electing United States shareholder on a sale or other disposition of his Company
shares also would be treated as ordinary income,  but such shareholder would not
be subject to an interest  charge on his resulting tax liability.  Special rules
apply to a United States shareholder that held his PFIC stock prior to the first
taxable year for which the mark-to-market election was effective.

      A United States  shareholder with a valid QEF election in effect would not
be taxed on any  distributions  paid by the  Company  to the  extent  of any QEF
inclusions,  but any  distributions  out of accumulated  earnings and profits in
excess thereof would be treated as taxable  dividends.  Such a shareholder would
increase the tax basis in his Company shares by the amount of any QEF inclusions
and reduce  such tax basis by any  distributions  to him that are not taxable as
described  in the  preceding  sentence.  Special  rules  apply to United  States
shareholders  who make the QEF  election and wish to defer the payment of tax on
their annual QEF inclusions.

      Each  shareholder who desires QEF treatment must  individually  elect such
treatment. The QEF election must be made for the taxable year of the shareholder
in which or with which the taxable  year of the Company  ends. A QEF election is
effective  for the  shareholder's  taxable  year  for  which  it is made and all
subsequent  taxable years of the  shareholder and may not be revoked without the
consent of the Internal Revenue Service.  A shareholder of the Company who first
held his Company  shares after November 30, 2003 and who files his tax return on
the basis of a calendar  year may make a QEF election on his 2004 tax return.  A
shareholder  of the  Company  who  first  held his  Company  shares on or before
November  30,  2003 may also make the QEF  election  on his 2004 tax  return but
should consult his tax advisor concerning the tax consequences and special rules
that apply when a QEF election  could have been made with respect to such shares
for an earlier taxable year.

      The QEF election  must be made by the due date,  with  extensions,  of the
federal  income tax return for the  taxable  year for which the  election  is to
apply. Under Treasury regulations,  the QEF election is made on Internal Revenue
Service Form 8621, which must be completed and attached to a timely filed income
tax return in which the  shareholder  reports his QEF  inclusion for the year to
which the election applies. In order to allow United States shareholders to make
the  QEF  elections  and  to  comply  with  the  applicable   annual   reporting
requirements,  the  Company  annually  will  provide  to  them  a  "PFIC  Annual
Information  Statement"  containing  certain  information  required  by Treasury
regulations.

      In early 2005,  the Company will send to United  States  shareholders  the
PFIC Annual  Information  Statement  for the Company's  2004 taxable year.  Such
annual information statement may be used for purposes of completing Form 8621. A
shareholder  who either is subject  to a prior QEF  election  or is making a QEF
election for the first time must attach a completed  Form 8621 to his income tax
return each year.  Other United States  shareholders  also must attach completed
Forms 8621 to their tax returns  each year,  but  shareholders  not electing QEF
treatment will not need to report QEF inclusions thereon.

      Special  rules  apply to United  States  persons who hold  Company  shares
through  intermediate  entities or persons and to United States shareholders who
directly or indirectly pledge their shares, including those in a margin account.

      Ordinarily,  the tax basis that is obtained by a transferee of property on
the death of the owner of that  property  is  adjusted  to the  property's  fair
market value on the date of death (or  alternate  valuation  date).  If a United
States shareholder dies owning shares with respect to which he did not elect QEF
treatment  (or  elected  such  treatment  after the first year in which he owned
shares in which the  Company was a PFIC and did not elect to  recognize  gain as
described above),  the transferee of those shares will not be entitled to adjust
the tax basis in such shares to the fair  market  value on the date of death (or
alternate  valuation  date).  In that case, in general,  the  transferee of such
shares will take a basis in the shares equal to the shareholder's  basis therein
immediately before his death. If a United States shareholder dies owning Company
shares for which a valid QEF  election  was in effect for all  taxable  years in
such  shareholder's  holding  period during which the Company was a PFIC (or the
shareholder elected to treat the shares as if sold on the first day of the first
taxable year of the Company for which the QEF election was effective),  then the
basis  increase  generally  will be available  unless the holding period for his
shares began on or prior to November 30, 1987.  In the latter case,  in general,
any  otherwise  applicable  basis  increase will be reduced to the extent of the
shareholder's  ratable  share  of  the  earnings  and  profits  of  the  Company
accumulated for the period during which he held those shares between December 1,
1963 and November 30, 1987.

      DUE  TO  THE  COMPLEXITY  OF  THE  APPLICABLE  TAX  RULES,  UNITED  STATES
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS
CONCERNING  THE IMPACT OF THESE RULES ON THEIR  INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY AND ON
THEIR INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS.


                                                                              15

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (UNAUDITED)

EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. ("EquiServe") has been engaged to offer a dividend
reinvestment  plan (the  "Plan")  to  shareholders.  Shareholders  must elect to
participate in the Plan by signing an authorization.  The authorization appoints
EquiServe as agent to apply to the  purchase of common  shares of the Company in
the open market (i) all cash  dividends  (after  deduction of the service charge
described below) that become payable to such participant on the Company's shares
(including shares registered in his or her name and shares accumulated under the
Plan) and (ii) any voluntary  cash payments  ($50  minimum,  $3,000  maximum per
dividend  period)  received from such  participant  within 30 days prior to such
dividend payment date.

      For the  purpose  of  making  purchases,  EquiServe  will  commingle  each
participant's  funds with those of all other participants in the Plan. The price
per  share of  shares  purchased  for each  participant's  account  shall be the
average price (including brokerage  commissions and any other costs of purchase)
of all shares  purchased in the open market with the net funds  available from a
cash dividend and any voluntary cash payments being concurrently  invested.  Any
stock  dividends or split shares  distributed on shares held in the Plan will be
credited to the participant's account.

      For each participant, a service charge of 5% of the combined amount of the
participant's dividend and any voluntary payment being concurrently invested, up
to a maximum  charge of $2.50 per  participant,  will be  deducted  (and paid to
EquiServe) prior to each purchase of shares. Shareholder sales of shares held by
EquiServe in the Plan are subject to a fee of $10.00 plus  applicable  brokerage
commissions deducted from the proceeds of the sale.  Additional nominal fees are
charged by EquiServe  for  specific  shareholder  requests  such as requests for
information  regarding  share cost basis detail in excess of two prior years and
for replacement Forms 1099 older than three years.

      Participation  in the Plan may be terminated by a participant  at any time
by written  instructions  to EquiServe.  Upon  termination,  a participant  will
receive a  certificate  for the full  number of  shares  credited  to his or her
account, unless he or she requests the sale of all or part of such shares.

      Dividends  reinvested  by a shareholder  under the Plan will  generally be
treated for U.S.  federal  income tax  purposes in the same manner as  dividends
paid to such shareholder in cash. See "Certain tax information for United States
shareholders" for more information  regarding tax consequences to U.S. investors
of an investment in shares of the Company, including the effect of the Company's
status as a PFIC.  The  amount of the  service  charge  is  deductible  for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, subject to limitations.

      To participate in the Plan an investor may not hold his or her shares in a
"street name" brokerage account.

      Additional  information  regarding the Plan may be obtained from EquiServe
Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan, 150 Royall St., Canton, MA 02021.  Information may
also  be  obtained  by  calling   EquiServe's   Telephone   Response  Center  at

                              ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

      The following is a statement of the proxy voting policies and procedures
of ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company").

      PROXY ADMINISTRATION

      The Company understands its proxy voting responsibilities and that proxy
voting decisions may affect the long-term interests of its shareholders. The
Company attempts to process every proxy vote it receives. However, voting
proxies for shares of certain non-U.S. companies may involve significantly
greater effort and cost than for shares of U.S. companies. There may be
situations where the Company may not or cannot vote a proxy. For example, the
Company may receive proxy material too late to act upon or the cost of voting
may outweigh the benefit of voting.

      Authority and responsibility to vote proxies with respect to the Company's
portfolio securities has been delegated to the President. In evaluating proxy
proposals, the President may consider information from various sources,
including management of the company presenting a proposal as well as independent
sources. The ultimate decision rests with the President, who is accountable to
the Board of Directors of the Company.

      GENERAL PRINCIPLES

      In voting proxies, the Company will act solely in the best economic
interests of its shareholders with the goal of maximizing the value of the
Company's portfolio. These policies and procedures are designed to promote
accountability of a portfolio company's management and board of directors to its
shareholders and to align their interests with those of shareholders. These
policies and procedures recognize that a portfolio company's managers are
entrusted with the day-to-day operations of the company, as well as longer-term
strategic planning, subject to the company's board of directors.

<PAGE>

      The Company believes that the quality and depth of a portfolio company's
management, including its board of directors, is an important consideration in
determining the desirability of an investment. Accordingly, the recommendations
of management on many issues are given substantial weight in determining how to
vote a proxy. However, each issue is considered on its own merits, and the
position of the portfolio company's management will not be supported whenever it
is determined not to be in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders.

      SPECIFIC POLICIES

      A.    ROUTINE MATTERS

            1.    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. In general, the Company will vote in
                  favor of management's director nominees if they are running
                  unopposed. The Company believes that management is in the best
                  position to evaluate the qualifications of directors and the
                  needs of a particular board. Nevertheless, the Company will
                  vote against, or withhold its vote for, any nominee whom it
                  feels is not qualified. When management's nominees are opposed
                  in a proxy contest, the Company will evaluate which nominee's
                  publicly-announced management policies and goals are most
                  likely to maximize shareholder value, as well as the past
                  performance of the incumbent.

            2.    RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF AUDITORS. In general, the Company
                  will rely on the judgment of management in selecting the
                  independent auditors, nevertheless, the Company will examine
                  the recommendation of management in appropriate cases, e.g.,
                  where there has been a change in auditors based upon a
                  disagreement on accounting matters.

            3.    STOCK OPTION AND OTHER EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION PLAN
                  PROPOSALS. The Company will generally approve management's
                  recommendations with respect to the adoption or amendment of
                  stock option plans and other equity based compensation plans,
                  provided that the total number of shares reserved under all of
                  a company's plans is reasonable and not excessively dilutive.

      B.    ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS, REINCORPORATIONS, REORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER
            TRANSACTIONS

            Because voting on transactions such as acquisitions, mergers,
            reincorporations and reorganizations involve considerations unique
            to each transaction, the Company does not have a general policy in
            regard to voting on those transactions. The Company will vote on a
            case-by-case basis on each transaction.

<PAGE>

      C.    CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE

            The Company evaluates proposed capital actions on a case-by-case
            basis and will generally defer to management's business analysis in
            support of such actions. In cases where proposed capital actions
            support proxy defenses or act to reduce or limit shareholder rights,
            particular consideration will be given to all the effects of the
            action and the Company's vote will be made in a manner consistent
            with the objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value.

      D.    ANTI-TAKEOVER PROPOSALS

            In general, the Company will vote against any proposal which the
            Company believes would materially contribute to preventing a
            potential acquisition or takeover, including proposals to:

                   o     Stagger the board of directors;
                   o     Introduce cumulative voting;
                   o     Introduce unequal voting rights;
                   o     Create supermajority voting;
                   o     Establish preemptive rights.

            In general, the Company will vote in favor of any proposals to
            reverse the above.

      E.    SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS INVOLVING SOCIAL, MORAL OR ETHICAL MATTERS

            In general, the Company will vote in accordance with management's
            recommendation on issues that primarily involve social, moral or
            ethical matters, although exceptions may be made in certain
            instances where the Company believes a proposal has substantial
            economic implications.

      F.    CONFLICT OF INTEREST

            In view of the fact that the Company is internally managed and does
            not have an investment advisor, it is unlikely that conflicts of
            interest will arise in voting the proxies of the Company's portfolio
            companies. The Company maintains a record of the affiliated persons
            of each director and officer of the Company including the President.
            The Compliance Officer reviews proxy statement proposals to
            determine the existence of a potential conflict of interest. In the
            event that the President has a personal conflict of interest, he
            shall remove himself from the voting process. In cases of a conflict
            of interest, a record shall be maintained confirming that the
            Company's vote was made solely in the interests of the Company and
            without regard to any other consideration.

                  of the period covered by this report that have materially
                  affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
                  registrant's internal control over financial reporting since
                  ASA, the registrant's predecessor, filed its most recent Form
                  N-Q.

Item 12.    Exhibits.

                              ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.    PURPOSE OF CODE OF ETHICS

      The Board of Directors of ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company") has adopted
this Code of Ethics ("Code") to promote the honest and ethical conduct of the
Covered Officers (as described below), including the ethical handling of actual
or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships; to promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents the Company files with, or submits to, the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
communications made by the Company; and to promote compliance with applicable
laws and governmental rules and regulations. This Code was adopted for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and forms
thereunder. Covered Officers, as well as others, are subject to other policies
and procedures in respect of their positions with the Company.

II.   INTRODUCTION

      The Code of Ethics is applicable to the Company's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer ("Covered Officers," each of whom is
identified on Exhibit A).

      Each Covered Officer is expected to act with integrity and honesty, adhere
to a high standard of business ethics and be sensitive to situations that may
give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

      Waivers of this Code may be made only by the Board of Directors or the
Ethics Committee of the Board and will be disclosed in accordance with
applicable law.

III.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

      A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private interest
interferes with the interest of, or his service to, the Company. For example, a
conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Person used, or attempted to use,
his position with the Company to obtain any improper personal benefit for
himself, his family members, or any other person.

<PAGE>

      Certain conflicts of interest that may arise are already subject to
conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940
Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain
transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with
the Company because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The
Company's compliance programs and procedures are designed to address those
conflicts of interest and such conflicts are not covered by this Code.

      Although it is not possible to list and address every conceivable
conflict, the following are examples of actions that Covered Officers must take
to avoid conflict of interest situations. Each Covered Officer must not:

      o     use his personal influence or relationships improperly to influence
            investment decisions or financial reporting by the Company for the
            purpose of benefiting personally to the detriment of the Company;

      o     cause the Company to take actions, or fail to take action, for the
            personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of
            the Company;

      o     without the approval of the President (or, with respect to the
            President, approval of the Ethics Committee), accept employment with
            or serve as a director of another investment company, an investment
            adviser or any public company;

      o     accept any business related gift in excess of $100;

      o     accept any entertainment from any company with which the Company has
            current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment
            is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
            place, and not so frequent as to raise any reasonable question of
            impropriety;

      o     without the approval of the President (or, with respect to the
            President, approval of the Ethics Committee), have or acquire any
            ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
            with, any of the Company's service providers; and

      o     have a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
            transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
            portfolio transactions.

IV.   COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE

      Each Covered Officer:

<PAGE>

      o     is responsible for adhering to and promoting compliance with the
            standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
            regulations;

      o     is responsible for maintaining familiarity with the disclosure
            requirements applicable to the Company;

      o     shall not knowingly misrepresent, omit, or cause others to
            misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others,
            whether within or outside of the Company, including the Company's
            directors and independent auditors and governmental regulators;

      o     shall, to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility,
            consult with other officers and employees of the Company and its
            service providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
            timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents
            the Company files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
            communications made by the Company;

      o     shall not coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence any
            auditor engaged in the performance of an audit of the Company's
            financial statements or accounting books and records;

      o     shall not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any other
            officer or employee of the Company for reports of potential
            violations that are made in good faith.

      o     shall promptly bring to the attention of the President, the Ethics
            Committee and the Audit Committee any information he may have
            concerning (a) significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
            the design or operation of internal controls over financial
            reporting which are likely to adversely affect the Company's ability
            to record, process, summarize, and report financial information, and
            (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
            internal control over financial reporting; and

      o     shall promptly bring to the attention of the Chief Legal Officer,
            the President and the Ethics Committee any information he may have
            concerning evidence of a material violation of the securities laws
            or other laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company or of
            a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

V.    ACCOUNTABILITY

      The Ethics Committee shall have the power to monitor, investigate and
recommend action to the Board with respect to violations of this Code. The
Board, with the advice of the Ethics Committee, shall determine appropriate
actions to be taken in the event of violations of this Code by the Covered
Officers. Such actions shall be reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to
promote accountability for adherence to this Code. In determining what action is
appropriate in a particular case, the Board shall take into account all relevant
information, including the nature and severity of the violation, whether the
violation was a single occurrence or involved repeated occurrences, whether the
violation appears to have been intentional or inadvertent, whether the
individual in question had been advised prior to the violation as to the
appropriate course of action and whether or not the individual in question had
committed other violations in the past.

VI.   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COVERED OFFICER

      Upon becoming subject to this Code, each Covered Officer must affirm in
writing to the Board that he has received, read and understands the Code.
Thereafter, each Covered Officer must affirm annually to the Board that he has
complied with the requirements of the Code.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY OF REPORTS AND RECORDS

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Board, the Ethics Committee, the Audit
Committee and, as appropriate, their advisers.

VIII.

      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, including a majority of its
independent directors.

I, Robert J.A. Irwin, certify that:

      1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of ASA (Bermuda) Limited;

      2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
            statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
            to the period covered by the report;

      3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
            information included in this report, fairly present in all material
            respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in
            net assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required
            to include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and
            for, the periods presented in the report;

      4.    I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
            controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
            Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal control over financial
            reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company
            Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

            a.    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  my supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to me by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

            b.    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                  caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
                  designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
                  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
                  preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
                  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

            c.    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures and presented in this report my
                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

            d.    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
                  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                  materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

<PAGE>

      5.    I have disclosed to the registrant's auditors and the audit
            committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
            performing the equivalent functions):

            a.    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

            b.    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
