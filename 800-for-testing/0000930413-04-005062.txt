(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
determined by subtracting  the initial  investment  from the value at the end of
the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and expressing
the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income  dividends
and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's  dividend  reinvestment  plan.  Total  return  does  not  reflect  broker
commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period of less than one year is
not  annualized.  Total  return for a period more than one year  represents  the
average annual return.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes.  Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market  Price Yield is  determined  by dividing the  annualized  current per
share  dividend to common  shareholders  by the market price per common share at
August 31, 2004.

================================================================================

1.   ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nicholas-Applegate  Convertible  & Income Fund (the  "Fund") was  organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on January 17, 2003. Prior to commencing operations
on March 31, 2003, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  and the sale and
issuance of 6,981 shares of beneficial  interest at an aggregate  purchase price
of $100,003 to Allianz  Dresdner  Asset  Management of America,  L.P.  ("ADAM").
PIMCO Advisors Fund  Management  LLC (the  "Investment  Manager")  serves as the
Fund's  investment  manager and is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of ADAM
which is an indirect,  majority-owned  subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an
unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide total return through a combination
of capital  appreciation  and high current income.  The Fund attempts to achieve
this  objective  by  investing  in a portfolio  of  convertible  securities  and
non-convertible income-producing securities.

The Fund  issued  60,000,000  shares  of common  stock,  in its  initial  public
offering.  An additional  5,345,000  shares were issued in  connection  with the
exercise  of the  underwriters'  over-allotment  option.  These  shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting  discount of $0.675 per share.
Common offering costs of $1,642,062  (representing $0.025 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment  Manager  agreed to pay all common  offering costs
(other than the sales load) exceeding  $0.03 per share.  Because common offering
costs were less than $0.03 per share,  the Investment  Manager did not reimburse
any of these costs. In addition, the underwriters  commission and offering costs
associated  with the issuance of Preferred  Shares in the amounts of  $5,250,000
and $501,983,  respectively,  have been charged to  paid-in-capital in excess of
par.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations  which provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund.

(A)  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily  available are stated at market value.  The Fund's  investments  are
valued  daily  by an  independent  pricing  service  approved  by the  Board  of
Trustees,  dealer  quotations,  or are  valued  at the  last  sale  price on the
exchange that is the primary market for such securities,  or the last quoted bid
price for those securities for which the over-the-counter  market is the primary
market or for listed  securities in which there were no sales.  Prices  obtained
from an independent pricing service use information provided by market makers or
estimates of market values  obtained from yield data relating to  investments or
securities with similar  characteristics.  Short-term investments maturing in 60
days or less are valued at amortized  cost,  if their  original  maturity was 60
days or less, or by amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if
the  original  term to maturity  exceeded 60 days.  Securities  for which market
quotations are not readily available or if a  development/event  occurs that may
significantly  impact the value of the security,  may be fair valued pursuant to
guidelines  established by the Board of Trustees. The prices used by the Fund to
value  securities  may  differ  from the value  that  would be  realized  if the
securities  were sold.  The Fund's net asset  value is  determined  daily at the
close of regular  trading  (normally,  4:00 p.m.  Eastern  time) on the New York
Stock Exchange.

(B)  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased  are accreted or  amortized  to interest  income over the lives of the
respective  securities using the effective  interest method.  Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date.

(C)  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.  Accordingly, no
provision  for  U.S.  federal  income  taxes  is  required.   In  addition,   by
distributing  substantially  all of its ordinary  income and  long-term  capital
gains,  if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be subject to
U.S. federal excise tax.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
August 31, 2004 (unaudited)
================================================================================

(D)  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON STOCK

The Fund  declares  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to  common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the  ex-dividend  date.  The amount of dividends and  distributions  from net
investment  income and net realized  capital gains are  determined in accordance
with federal income tax  regulations,  which may differ from generally  accepted
accounting  principles.  These  "book-tax"  differences  are  either  considered
temporary or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature,  such amounts are  reclassified  within the capital accounts based on
their  federal  income  tax  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not  require
reclassification.  To the extent these  dividends  and/or  distributions  exceed
current and  accumulated  earnings  and profits for federal  income tax purposes
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess
of par.

(E)  CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES

Credit-linked  trust  certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other  vehicle  formed  under state law which,  in turn,  invests in a basket of
derivative  instruments,  such as credit default swaps,  interest rate swaps and
other  securities,  in order to  provide  exposure  to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Similar  to  an  investment  in  a  bond,  investments  in  credit-linked  trust
certificates  represent the right to receive  periodic  income  payments (in the
form of  distributions)  and payment of  principal at the end of the term of the
certificate.  However,  these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential  obligations to, the  counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(F)  INTEREST RATE CAPS

In an  interest  rate cap,  one party pays a fee while the other  party pays the
excess,  if any, of a floating rate over a specified  fixed rate.  Interest rate
caps are intended to manage the Fund's  exposure to changes in short-term  rates
and hedge the Auction  Preferred  Shares.  Owning interest rate caps reduces the
Fund's  duration,  making it less  sensitive to changes in interest rates from a
market value perspective.  The effect on income involves  protection from rising
short-term rates, which the Fund experiences  primarily in the form of leverage.
The Fund is exposed to credit loss in the event of  non-performance by the other
party to the interest rate cap.

(G)  CONCENTRATION OF RISK

It is the  Fund's  policy  to  invest a  significant  portion  of its  assets in
convertible securities.  Although convertible securities do derive part of their
value from that of the securities into which they are convertible,  they are not
considered  derivative  financial  instruments.  However,  certain of the Fund's
investments  include  features which render them more sensitive to price changes
in their underlying securities.  Consequently,  this exposes the Fund to greater
downside risk than traditional convertible securities,  but still less than that
of the underlying common stock.

2.   INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER

The Fund has entered into an Investment  Management  Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as the Fund's Investment  Manager.  Subject
to the  supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees,  the Investment  Manager is
responsible  for managing,  either directly or through other selected by it, the
Fund's  investment  activities  and  its  business  affairs  and  administrative
matters.  Pursuant to the  Agreement,  the Fund pays the  Investment  Manager an
annual  fee,  payable at the annual  rate of 0.70% of the Fund's  average  daily
total managed assets. Total managed assets refer to the total assets of the Fund
(including  assets  attributable  to any  Preferred  Shares  or  other  forms of
leverage  that  may  be  outstanding)  minus  accrued  liabilities  (other  than
liabilities  representing  leverage).  The  Investment  Manager has retained its
affiliate,  Nicholas-Applegate  Capital Management LLC (the  "Sub-Adviser"),  to
manage the Fund's  investments.  Subject to the  supervision  of the  Investment
Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all the Fund's investment decisions.

3.   INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the six months ended August 31, 2004,  purchases  and sales of  investments,
other  than  short-term   securities,   were   $497,568,437  and   $495,583,806,
respectively.

(a)  Interest rate cap agreements outstanding at August 31, 2004 was as follows:

Counter-   Notional   Termination              Payments received     Unrealized
party       Amount       Date       Premium         by Fund         Depreciation

================================================================================

4.   AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 4,200 shares of Preferred  Shares  Series A, 4,200 shares of
Preferred  Shares  Series B, 4,200  shares of Preferred  Shares  Series C, 4,200
shares of Preferred Shares Series D, and 4,200 shares of Preferred Shares Series
E each with a net asset and liquidation  value of $25,000 per share plus accrued
dividends.

Dividends  are  accumulated   daily  at  an  annual  rate  set  through  auction
procedures.  Distributions  of net  realized  capital  gains,  if any,  are paid
annually.

For the six months ended August 31, 2004,  the  annualized  dividend rate ranged
from:

                                    High              Low          At 8/31/04
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Series A                            1.70%            1.02%            1.65%
Series B                            1.70%            1.04%            1.54%
Series C                            1.70%            1.05%            1.60%
Series D                            1.68%            1.05%            1.60%
Series E                            1.70%            1.05%            1.54%

The Fund is subject to certain  limitations  and  restrictions  while  preferred
shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and
restrictions   could   preclude  the  Fund  from   declaring  any  dividends  or
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share,  generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

5.   SUBSEQUENT COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS

On  September  1, 2004,  a dividend  of $0.125 per share was  declared to common
shareholders  payable October 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on September 10,
2004.

On October  1, 2004,  a  dividend  of $0.125  per share was  declared  to common
shareholders  payable  November 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on October 15,
2004.

6.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 1, 2004, the Attorney  General of the State of New Jersey announced that
it had  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement  with  ADAM  and  certain  other
affiliates of the Investment  Manager,  in connection  with a complaint filed by
the New Jersey Attorney  General  ("NJAG").  In the  settlement,  ADAM and other
named  affiliates  neither admitted nor denied the allegations or conclusions of
law,  but did agree to pay New Jersey a civil fine of $15 million and $3 million
for investigative  costs and further potential  enforcement  initiatives against
unrelated parties.  They also undertook to implement certain governance changes.
The complaint relating to the settlement alleged,  among other things, that ADAM
and the other  affiliates  had failed to disclose that they  improperly  allowed
certain hedge funds to engage in "market timing" in various open-end  investment
companies  ("open-end  funds") advised or distributed by the Investment  Manager
and certain of its affiliates.  The complaint sought  injunctive  relief,  civil
monetary penalties, restitution and disgorgement of profits.

On September 13, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
announced that the  Investment  Manager and certain of its affiliates had agreed
to a settlement of charges that they and certain of their  officers  had,  among
other things,  violated various antifraud  provisions of the federal  securities
laws in connection with an alleged  market-timing  arrangement involving trading
of shares of various open-end funds advised and/or distributed by the Investment
Manager and its affiliates. In the settlement,  the Investment Manager and their
affiliates  consented to the entry of an order by the  Commission  and,  without
admitting  or denying the findings  contained in the order,  agreed to implement
certain  compliance  and  governance  changes and consented to  cease-and-desist
orders and censures.  In addition,  the  Investment  Manager and its  affiliates
agreed to pay civil money  penalties  aggregating $40 million and to pay jointly
disgorgement  in the  amount of $10  million,  for an  aggregate  payment of $50
million. In connection with the settlement, the Commission has indicated that it
will seek to dismiss the Investment  Manager and its affiliates from the related
complaint  it filed on May 6, 2004 in the U.S.  District  Court in the  Southern
District  of  New  York.  Neither  the  complaint  nor  the  order  alleges  any
inappropriate activity took place with respect to the Fund.

August 31, 2004 (unaudited)
================================================================================

On September 15, 2004, the Commission  announced that the Investment Manager and
certain of its affiliates  agreed to settle an enforcement  action in connection
with  charges that they  violated  various  antifraud  and other  provisions  of
federal  securities  laws as a result of, among other  things,  their failure to
disclose to the board of trustees and  shareholders  of various  open-end  funds
advised or  distributed by the  Investment  Manager and its affiliates  material
facts  and  conflicts  of  interest  that  arose  from  their  use of  brokerage
commissions  on  portfolio  transactions  to pay  for  so-called  "shelf  space"
arrangements  with certain  broker-dealers.  In the  settlement,  the Investment
Manager and its affiliates  consented to the entry of an order by the Commission
without admitting or denying the findings  contained in the order. In connection
with the  settlement,  the  Investment  Manager  and its  affiliates  agreed  to
undertake   certain   compliance  and   disclosure   reforms  and  consented  to
cease-and-desist  orders and censures.  In addition,  the Investment Manager and
one of its  affiliates  agreed to  jointly  pay a civil  monetary  penalty of $4
million  and  another  affiliate  agreed to pay a civil  monetary  penalty of $1
million  and the  Investment  Manager and its  affiliates  agreed to jointly pay
disgorgement  of $6.6  million  based upon the amount of  brokerage  commissions
alleged  to have been  paid by such  open-end  funds in  connection  with  these
arrangements  (and  related  interest).  In a  related  action,  the  California
Attorney  General  announced  on  September  15,  2004  that it had  entered  an
agreement  with an  affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager in  resolution  of an
investigation   into  matters  that  are  similar  to  those  discussed  in  the
Commission's  order. The settlement  agreement resolves matters described in the
compliant filed by the California  Attorney General in the Superior Court of the
State of California  alleging,  among other things, that this affiliate violated
certain  antifraud  provisions of California law by failing to disclose  matters
related to the  shelf-space  arrangements  described  above.  In the  settlement
agreement,  the  affiliate  did not admit to any  liability but agreed to pay $5
million  in civil  penalties  and $4 million in  recognition  of the  California
Attorney  General's fees and costs associated with the investigation and related
matters.  Neither the Commission's  order nor the California  Attorney General's
complaint  alleges any  inappropriate  activity  took place with  respect to the
Fund.

Since  February 2004, the Investment  Manager,  the  Sub-Adviser  and certain of
their  affiliates  have been named as  defendants  in 14 lawsuits  filed in U.S.
District  Court in the Southern  District of New York,  the Central  District of
California  and the  Districts  of New  Jersey  and  Connecticut.  Ten of  those
lawsuits  concern  "market  timing,"  and  they  have  been  transferred  to and
consolidated  for  pre-trial  proceedings  in the U.S.  District  Court  for the
District of Maryland;  four of those  lawsuits  concern  "revenue  sharing" with
brokers offering "shelf space" and have been  consolidated  into a single action
in the U.S.  District Court for the District of  Connecticut.  The lawsuits have
been  commenced as putative  class actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed  shares of  affiliated  funds  during  specified  periods or as
derivative  actions on behalf of the funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the
same facts that are the subject of the regulatory  proceedings  discussed above.
The lawsuits seek,  among other things,  unspecified  compensatory  damages plus
interest  and, in some cases,  punitive  damages,  the  rescission of investment
advisory  contracts,   the  return  of  fees  paid  under  those  contracts  and
restitution.  The Fund has been named in three of the lawsuits concerning market
timing.  The Investment  Manager and the Sub-Adviser  believe that other similar
lawsuits may be filed in U.S.  federal or state courts naming as defendants  the
Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser,  ADAM, the Fund, other open- and closed-end
funds advised or distributed by the Investment  Manager,  the SubAdviser  and/or
their affiliates, the boards of trustees of those funds, and/or other affiliates
as defendants.

Under Section 9(a) of the Investment  Company Act of 1940, if any of the various
regulatory  proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser,  ADAM and/or their affiliates, they and
their  affiliates  would,  in the  absence of  exemptive  relief  granted by the
Commission,  be barred  from  serving as an  investment  adviser/sub-adviser  or
principal underwriter for any registered investment company, including the Fund.
In connection  with an inquiry from the Commission  concerning the status of the
New Jersey  settlement  described  above  under  Section  9(a),  the  Investment
Manager,  the  Sub-Adviser,  and  certain  of their  affiliates  (together,  the
"Applicants")  have sought  exemptive  relief from the Commission  under Section
9(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940.  The  Commission  has granted the
Applicants  a  temporary  exemption  from the  provisions  of Section  9(a) with
respect to the New Jersey settlement until the earlier of (i) September 13, 2006
and  (ii)  the  date on  which  the  Commission  takes  final  action  on  their
application  for a permanent  order.  There is no assurance  that the Commission
will issue a permanent order.

It is possible that these matters and/or other developments resulting from these
matters  could lead to a decrease  in the market  price of the Fund's  shares or
other  adverse  consequences  to the Fund  and its  shareholders.  However,  the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Fund or on the Investment  Manager's or
the Sub-Adviser's ability to perform its respective investment advisory services
relating to the Fund.

7.   CORPORATE CHANGES

On July 29, 2004, Stephen Treadway resigned as the Fund's Chairman. On September
14, 2004, David C. Flattum was appointed to the Board of Trustees. On October 5,
2004, the Board of Trustees elected Robert E. Connor as Chairman.

Appendix  B  to  the  Nominating  Committee  Charter  includes  "Procedures  for

which shareholders may recommend nominees to the Registrant's Board of Trustees.
Among  other   requirements,   the  procedures  provide  that  the  recommending

executive offices of the Registrant and that such submission must be received at
such  offices  not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days  prior to the date of
the Board or  shareholder  meeting at which the nominee  would be  elected.  Any
recommendation must include certain biographical and other information regarding
the candidate and the recommending  shareholder,  and must include a written and
signed  consent  of the  candidate  to be named as a  nominee  and to serve as a
Trustee if elected.  The foregoing  description  of the  requirements  is only a
summary  and is  qualified  in its  entirety by  reference  to Appendix B of the
Nominating Committee Charter.

      significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
