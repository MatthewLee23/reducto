President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

Through the first eleven months of 2010, the U.S. economy moved forward on a
slow path to recovery. But with the memory of a deep recession still lingering,
businesses and consumers remained cautious about both investing and spending.
While business fundamentals showed signs of improvement, there was still a
reluctance to hire, and high unemployment remains a problem. Wary investors,
concerned about risk, gravitated towards cash and bonds. We remain generally
optimistic about the prospects for economic recovery, although it may occur
more slowly than many would like.

At Pioneer, we have long advocated the benefits of staying diversified and
investing for the long term. This strategy has generally performed well for
many investors. Bond markets certainly rewarded investors in the first eleven
months of 2010. While the equity markets barely budged, equities at the end of
November 2010 were inexpensive relative to bonds, compared with historic
levels, and represented potentially good value for long-term investors.

Pioneer has not changed the basic approach to investing that we have used for
more than 80 years. We remain focused on company fundamentals and risk
management. Our investment process is based on careful research into individual
companies, quantitative analysis, and active portfolio management. This
three-pillared process, which we apply to each of our portfolios, is supported
by an integrated team approach and is designed to carefully balance risk and
reward. Our experienced professionals devote themselves to the careful research
needed to identify investment opportunities in markets around the world.

Our advice, as always, is to work closely with a trusted financial advisor to
discuss your goals and work together to develop an investment strategy that
meets your individual needs. There is no single best strategy that works for
every investor.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/10

An improving economy helped lift corporate profits and provide a favorable
backdrop for investing in floating-rate bank loans during the 12 months ended
November 30, 2010. While most bank loans produced healthy returns, lower-rated
loans generated superior returns as investors grew more confident and sought
opportunities for more generous yields. In the following interview, Jonathan
Sharkey discusses the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer Floating
Rate Trust during the 12-month period. Mr. Sharkey, vice president, is a member
of Pioneer's Fixed-Income Department and, is responsible for the daily
management of the Trust.

Q  How did the Trust perform during the 12 months ended November 30, 2010?

A  Pioneer Floating Rate Trust produced a total return of 18.10% at net asset
   value, and 22.63% at market price for the 12 months ended November 30,
   2010, while the Trust's benchmark, the Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan
   Index (the Credit Suisse Index), returned 11.44%. Unlike the Trust, the
   Credit Suisse Index is not leveraged. On November 30, 2010, the Trust's
   30-day SEC yield was 9.22%.

   At November 30, 2010, the Trust was selling at a premium of market price-
   to-net asset value of 5.11%. Unlike open-ended funds, the market prices of
   closed-end funds go up and down based on supply and demand, irrespective of
   a closed-end fund's net asset value per share. It is not unusual to find
   closed-end funds trading at a discount or premium to their net asset value.
   During the 12-month period, we reduced the Trust's dividend rate. The need
   to reduce the dividend rate was the combination of the following factors:
   replacement of higher yielding loans that were refinanced with lower
   yielding loans, overall lower yields resulting from market spread
   compression during the year and, to a lesser extent, the impact of some
   defaulted loans during the period.

Q  What led to the Trust's strong relative performance compared with the CS
   Index over the 12 months ended November 30, 2010?

A  The Trust's superior performance derived both from the change in direction of
   the Trust's investments to reduce risk in a higher default rate
   environment, a continued rally in riskier assets, good security selection
   in floating-rate loans, especially among lower-rated investments and from
   the Trust's ability to use leverage provided by preferred shares to invest
   in additional floating-rate loans. Leverage amplifies the Trust's results
   when the Trust's


4   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10
<PAGE>

   investments pay at higher rates than the dividend rates payable on the
   preferred shares as was the case during the 12 months ended November 30,
   2010. While the use of leverage can increase investment opportunity it can
   also increase investment risk. At the end of the Trust's fiscal year, on
   November 30, 2010, approximately 36% of the Trust's total investment
   portfolio was financed by borrowing. As stated above, unlike the Trust, the
   CS Index is not leveraged.

Q  Can you comment on the use of leverage in the Trust's portfolio?

A  We believe the use of leverage for investment purposes can increase
   investment opportunity, as well as investment risk. The Trust uses
   financial leverage primarily in an effort to increase dividend yield to
   common shareowners. The Trust uses auction-rate preferred shares as a
   low-cost way of borrowing to provide leverage for the Trust. Leverage was a
   contributor to performance relative to the benchmark CS Leveraged Loan
   Index over the Trust's fiscal year ended November 30, 2010.

Q  What was the investment environment like for floating-rate bank loans during
   the 12 months ended November 30, 2010?

A  Floating-rate bank loans performed well, as investors were attracted by
   continued discounted prices, which afforded the opportunity for capital
   appreciation, yields that were above average from a historical perspective,
   and expectations that an improving economy would help corporations grow
   their earnings and meet their debt obligations. Giving further support to
   bank loan prices were low new default rates and the ability of many
   corporations to refinance their debts by retiring bank loans and issuing
   new corporate bonds. The generally positive environment for floating-rate
   loans did encounter some turbulence in the spring of 2010, due to problems
   in Europe and an apparent slowing of the domestic economic recovery.
   Investors became increasingly worried that the economic recovery might
   falter. Compounding those worries were severe debt problems in Greece and
   several other European nations, which created fears that financial problems
   in Europe could undermine the global economy. The concerns about the
   domestic recovery abated in the late summer of 2010. As more positive
   economic news appeared and the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) Chairman
   Ben Bernanke, in August 2010, outlined new plans to inject more liquidity
   into the market. Meanwhile, a rescue plan for its troubled members put
   forth by the European Union appeared to calm anxieties about the
   potentially contagious consequences of a European financial crisis. As a
   consequence, bank loans again performed well during the closing months of
   the 12-month period. Loans also held up well when the high-yield market
   sold off in November.


                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10  5
<PAGE>

Q  What were your principal strategies in managing the Trust during the 12
   months ended November 30, 2010?

A  We continued to pay careful attention to individual security analysis in
   making investments for the Trust. While the generally positive environment
   provided a favorable backdrop for our strategy, the Trust did experience
   some loan investments that were called back by their issuing corporations
   because they were able to refinance their debt with new high-yield bond
   issues. The Trust profited from those transactions, although the portfolio
   did lose some of its higher-yielding holdings as a result. In the current
   low-interest-rate environment, new loan investments have tended to be
   higher-rated and lower-yielding than the loans that were repaid. As the
   process unfolded over the 12 months ended November 30, 2010, the Trust's
   investments in loans rated CCC, for example, declined from 7% of the
   Trust's total investment portfolio to 1.3%. In general, the Trust's new
   loan investments tended to have superior credit structures and better
   investor protections than their predecessors. By industry, we tended to
   focus the Trust's portfolio more on investments in loans to companies that
   we feel should benefit from a growing economy, while cutting back on
   investments in more defensive industries. We increased the Trust's exposure
   to the capital goods, information technology, and non-durable consumer
   industries, while reducing investments in broadcast services and health
   care loans. We also continued to work down over-concentrations that had
   achieved return targets.

Q  What were some of the individual investments that most affected the Trust's
   performance over the 12 months ended November 30, 2010?

A  Three of the Trust's top-performing investments during the 12-month period
   were also among the Trust's larger holdings, which were loans to Seven
   Media, an Australian broadcasting firm that enjoyed improved operating
   results; Level 3 Communications, a corporation that provides the
   fiber-optic infrastructure for telecommunication and internet
   transmissions; and Spirit Finance, a commercial real estate corporation
   whose prospects improved as the real estate market stabilized. Also
   supporting the Trust's performance results during the period were
   investments in loans to Ford Motor, which has been the most profitable of
   the American auto companies; Hargray Communications, a regional
   telecommunication services provider; Sirva, a trucking and logistics
   corporation whose operations include Allied Van Lines, North American Van
   Lines and Global Van Lines; and Delphi Holdco, an automotive parts company
   that successfully emerged from bankruptcy.

   Several of the Trust's loan investments did produce disappointing returns
   during the 12 months ended November 30, 2010, however. The poorer-
   performing investments included loans to the movie production company

6   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10
<PAGE>

   MGM, and to Home Interiors and Gifts, which markets home decorative items.
   Both corporations filed for bankruptcy protection. In addition, the value
   of loans to Grace Way Pharmaceutical declined when the company lost a drug
   patent fight. The declining value of the euro currency in the first half of
   the period also contributed to poor results from the Trust's positions in
   loans to some European corporations, including a cable communications
   operator and a phone directory publisher whose loans were denominated in
   the euro.

Q  What is your investment outlook?

A  We believe that floating-rate bank loans should continue to perform well as
   the economy continues to expand. As the Trust's new fiscal year began, bank
   loans appeared attractive relative to other asset classes, as their default
   rates remained low and many loans still were selling at discounts to their
   par (face) values. An improved economy should lead to continued lower
   defaults, which when coupled with the prospect of rate increases by the Fed
   should make investor demand for loans increase. More investor demand could
   also lead to a stronger secondary market for loans and at the current
   discounts could lead to additional returns.

   We also think the late-2010 agreement to extend existing income tax rates
   should be good for the economy. We expect the economy to continue to grow,
   lifting corporate profits. We also think that more bank loans may be called
   back by their issuers, at a profit to investors, as merger-and-acquisition
   activity rises in an improving economy. All of those factors should, in our
   opinion, benefit investments in floating-rate loans.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 12-38 for a full listing
of Trust securities.

Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained in
the Trust's original offering prospectus and shareowner reports from time to
time. Please refer to these documents when considering the Trust's risks.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the
Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally
more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be
difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares. The
Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt securities,
which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant risks,
including the risk


                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10  7
<PAGE>

that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be sufficient to cover
the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the return for the holders of
common shares. Since February of 2008, regularly scheduled auctions for the
Trust's preferred shares have failed and preferred shareowners have not been
able to sell their shares at auction. The Board of Trustees of the Trust has
considered, and continues to consider, this issue.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and rating agency asset
coverage requirements in connection with its outstanding preferred shares. In
order to maintain required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to
alter the composition of its investment portfolio or take other actions, such
as redeeming preferred shares with the proceeds from portfolio transactions, at
what might be inopportune times in the market. Such actions could reduce the
net earnings or returns to holders of the Trust's common shares over time.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of the opinion of the Trust's adviser as of the date of this report.
These statements should not be relied upon for any other purposes.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value (NAV), due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices
lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total
liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common
shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher than market
price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.


The CS Leveraged Loan Index is a representative index of tradeable, senior,
secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The index began in January 1992. Index
returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike
Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. Unlike the
Trust, the index is not leveraged. It is not possible to invest directly in an
index.

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/10

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a
diversified fund. The investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high
level of current income. The Trust will, as a secondary objective, also seek
preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its primary objective of
high current income.

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus with additional information included in the
Trust's shareowner reports from time to time. Please refer to those documents
when considering the Trust's investment risks. At times, the Trust's
investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated
or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any economic,
political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries
and sectors.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities and
high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below
investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. Additionally, the Trust may
invest in "event-linked" bonds, which sometimes are referred to as
"insurance-linked" or "catastrophe" bonds. The return of principal and the
payment of interest on event-linked bonds are contingent on the non-occurrence
of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a
specific magnitude. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked
bonds may expose the fund to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
(credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
adverse tax consequences.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited or
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a


44   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10
<PAGE>

developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Trust
believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more
difficult to value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:


A. Security Valuation

   Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
   loan interests (Senior Loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
   established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
   bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
   Loan Pricing Corporation. Senior loans for which no reliable price quotes are
   available will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
   pricing matrices to determine valuations. Fixed-income securities with
   remaining maturity of more than sixty days are valued at prices supplied by
   independent pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices,
   market events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
   maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers and other
   sources, as required. Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are
   valued at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are
   traded. Equity securities or loan interests for which independent pricing
   services are unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or
   quotations are not readily available or are considered to be unreliable are
   valued using fair value methods pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board
   of Trustees.

   The Trust may use fair value methods if it is determined that a significant
   event has occurred after the close of the exchange or market on which the


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10  45
<PAGE>

   security trades and prior to the determination of the Trust's net asset
   value. Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ from exchange
   prices.

   At November 30, 2010, twenty-seven securities were valued using fair value
   methods (in addition to securities valued using prices supplied by
   independent pricing services) representing 4.9% of net assets applicable to
   common shareowners. Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a
   security may include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company,
   current market conditions and comparable securities. Short-term fixed income
   securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less generally are
   valued at amortized cost. Money market mutual funds are valued at net asset
   value.

   Discounts and premiums on debt securities are accreted or amortized,
   respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield to maturity
   basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost basis of the
   security. Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash
   accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes
   withheld at the applicable country rates.

   Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
   dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
   are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
   the exercise of reasonable diligence.

   Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
   cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.


B. Foreign Currency Translation

   The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
   denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
   current exchange rates.

   Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
   represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
   currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
   between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
   Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
   investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
   effects of changes in market prices of those securities but are included with
   the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.


C. Federal Income Taxes

   It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
   Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
   all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
   shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Tax
   returns


46   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10
<PAGE>

   for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examination by tax
   authorities.

   The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
   financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal income
   tax rules. Therefore, the sources of the Trust's distributions may be shown
   in the accompanying financial statements as from or in excess of net
   investment income or as from net realized gain (loss) on investments and
   foreign currency transactions, or as from paid-in capital, depending on the
   type of book/tax differences that may exist.

   At November 30, 2010, the Trust reclassified $239,662 to increase
   undistributed net investment income and $239,662 to increase accumulated net
   realized loss on investments and foreign currency transactions. The
   reclassification has no impact on the net asset value of the Trust and
   presents the Trust's capital accounts on a tax basis.

   The Trust has elected to defer $20,412,580 in capital losses realized between
   November 1, 2010 and November 30, 2010 to its fiscal year ending November 30,
   2011.

   At November 30, 2010, the Trust had a capital loss carryforward of
   $101,854,514 of which the following amounts will expire between 2016 and 2018
   if not utilized: $27,976,876 in 2016, $62,461,978 in 2017 and $11,415,660 in
   2018.

   The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and preferred
   shareowners during the years ended November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009
   was as follows:

<PAGE>

   The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
   primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
   methods for premiums and discounts on fixed-income securities, book/tax
   differences in the accrual of income on securities in default and the
   realization of unrealized gain on investments in passive foreign investment
   companies.


D. Repurchase Agreements

   With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value of
   the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest is
   required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
   for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
   account of the Trust's custodian or a subcustodian of the Trust. The Trust's
   investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), is responsible
   for determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to
   the repurchase price.


E. Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

   All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
   automatically whose shares are registered in their own names automatically
   participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Plan), under
   which participants receive all dividends and capital gain distributions
   (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares of the Trust
   in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the Plan.
   Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and capital
   gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary
   and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by notifying
   American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in
   administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to any dividend
   record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with
   respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

   If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
   other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
   the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
   the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
   or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividend in common shares of the
   Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the plan.

   Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
   participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
   acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
   but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
   outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,


48   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10
<PAGE>

   on the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share is
   equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
   trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount
   in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common shares to be
   credited to each account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of
   the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the date the shares
   are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then current market
   price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the
   payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
   greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest
   the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There
   are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However,
   each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
   with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the
   Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes
   which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding
   Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to
   another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.


2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit),
manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's
Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall
not include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility of the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the year ended November 30, 2010, the net management
fee was equivalent to 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which
was equivalent to 1.13% of the Trust's average daily net assets attributable to
the common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At
November 30, 2010, $350,856 was payable to PIM related to management costs,
administrative costs and certain other reimbursements and is included in "Due
to affiliates" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Effective September 1, 2010, PIM has retained State Street Bank and Trust
Company (State Street) to provide certain administrative and accounting
services to the Trust on its behalf. For such services, PIM pays State Street a



                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10  49
<PAGE>

monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the Trust's monthly managed assets up
to $500 million and 0.03% for monthly managed assets in excess of $500 million,
subject to a minimum monthly fee of $10,000. Previously, PIM had retained
Princeton Administrators, LLC (Princeton) to provide such services. PIM paid
Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in
excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $10,000. Neither
State Street nor Princeton received compensation directly from the Trust for
providing such services.


3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all
transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at
negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) is the
transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with respect
to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares (AMPS). The Trust pays Deutsche
Bank an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and Deutsche
Bank, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.


4. Unfunded Loan Commitments

As of November 30, 2010, the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of $2,445,348,
(excluding unrealized depreciation on those commitments of $235,308 as of
November 30, 2010) which could be extended at the option of the borrower,

</TABLE>

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of beneficial interest
into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As of
November 30, 2010, there were 7,298 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,434, Series
W7-2,432 and Series TH7-2,432.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is to be reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An auction
fails if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers. When an
auction fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate on the
auction dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred shareowners
are not able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction fails. Since
February 2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The
maximum rate for each series is the greater of 125% of the one week LIBOR rate
or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS ranged from
1.458% to 1.583% during the year ended November 30, 2010.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10  51
<PAGE>

unpaid dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to
mandatory redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the
composition of the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the
Statement of Preferences are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. Holders of AMPS are also entitled to elect two
of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares and
(b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including, among
other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.


6. Pending Litigation

The Trust is currently involved in litigation matters relating to Trust
investments. The Trust believes these claims are without merit and is defending
both vigorously. At November 30, 2010, it is reasonably possible that adverse
outcomes may result. Currently, the amount of either judgment cannot be
reasonably estimated.


7. Subsequent Events

Subsequent to November 30, 2010, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.0725 per common share
payable December 20, 2010 to common shareowners of record on December 13, 2010.


Subsequent to November 30, 2010, dividends declared and paid on preferred
shares totaled $424,210 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share
series through January 26, 2011.

In preparing these financials statements, PIM has evaluated the impact of all
events and transaction for potential recognition or disclosure, and has
determined that other than disclosed above, there were no subsequent events
requiring recognition or disclosure in the financials statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Trustees and the Shareowners of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2010, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2010, by correspondence
with the custodian, selling or agent banks and brokers or by other appropriate
auditing procedures where replies from selling or agent banks or brokers were
not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust at November 30, 2010, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and financial highlights for each of the
periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement (unaudited)

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM) serves as the investment adviser to
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between PIM and the Trust. In order for PIM to remain the investment
adviser of the Trust, the Trustees of the Trust must determine annually whether
to renew the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

The contract review process began in March 2010 as the Trustees of the Trust
agreed on, among other things, an overall approach and timeline for the
process. In July 2010, the Trustees approved the format of the contract review
materials and submitted their formal request to PIM to furnish information
necessary to evaluate the terms of the investment advisory agreement. The
contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in September 2010.
After reviewing and discussing the materials, the Trustees submitted a request
for additional information to PIM, and materials were provided in response to
this request. Meetings of the independent Trustees of the Trust were held in
July, September, October, and November, 2010 to review and discuss the contract
review materials. In addition, the Trustees took into account the information
related to the Trust provided to the Trustees at each regularly scheduled
meeting.

At a meeting held on November 16, 2010, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by PIM and third parties, the Trustees of the Trust,
including the independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for another year. In considering
the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees considered
various factors that they determined were relevant, including the factors
described below. The Trustees did not identify any single factor as the
controlling factor in determining to approve the renewal of the agreement.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services
The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by PIM to the Trust, taking into account the investment objective
and strategy of the Trust. The Trustees reviewed the terms of the investment
advisory agreement. The Trustees also reviewed PIM's investment approach for
the Trust, its research process and its process for trade execution. The
Trustees considered the resources of PIM and the personnel of PIM who provide
investment management services to the Trust. The Trustees considered the
non-investment resources and personnel of PIM involved in PIM's services to the
Trust, including PIM's compliance and legal resources and personnel. In
addition, the Trustees considered the arrangements put in place to retain key
investment and other personnel. The Trustees also considered the substantial


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10  55
<PAGE>

attention and high priority given by PIM's senior management to the Pioneer
fund complex.

The Trustees considered that PIM supervises and monitors the performance of the
Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including
Trust officers) and other resources that are necessary for the Trust's business
management and operations. The Trustees also considered that, as administrator,
PIM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees paid to PIM for the provision of
administration services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had been provided by PIM to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory
agreement.

Performance of the Trust
The Trustees considered the performance results of the Trust over various time
periods. They reviewed information comparing the Trust's performance with the
performance of its peer group of funds as classified by Morningstar, Inc.
(Morningstar), an independent provider of investment company data, and with the
performance of the Trust's benchmark index. The Trustees considered that the
Trust's annualized total return was in the third quintile of its Morningstar
category for the one year period ended June 30, 2010, in the fifth quintile of
its Morningstar category for the three year period ended June 30, 2010, and in
the fourth quintile of its Morningstar category for the five year period ended
June 30, 2010. (In all quintile rankings referred to throughout this
disclosure, first quintile is most favorable to the Trust's shareowners. Thus,
highest relative performance would be first quintile and lowest relative
expenses would also be first quintile.) The Trustees noted that the yield of
the Trust compared favorably to the yield of the Trust's benchmark as of June
30, 2010. The Trustees reviewed data provided by PIM showing how leverage had
benefited the Trust's common shareholders. The Trustees discussed the reasons
for the Trust's underperformance in respect of total return with PIM in view of
the Trust's investment approach and the market conditions present during the
relevant periods. The Trustees noted that PIM assumed sole responsibility for
the Trust's assets effective January 1, 2009 and agreed that they would
continue to monitor the performance of the Trust closely.

Management Fee and Expenses
The Trustees considered information on the fees and expenses of the Trust in
comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party.

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee rate based on common
shares assets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was in the fifth


56   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/10
<PAGE>

quintile relative to the management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic
Insight peer group for the comparable period. The Trustees considered the
effect of leverage on the Trust's management fee relative to its peers by
reviewing the management fee ratios of the Trust and its peers based on managed
assets rather than common shares assets. They noted that, on that basis, the
Trust's management fee for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was in the
third quintile relative to the Trust's peer group for the comparable period.
The Trustees also considered that the Trust's expense ratio based on common
shares assets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was in the third
quintile relative to its Strategic Insight peer group for the comparable
period.

The Trustees also reviewed management fees charged by PIM to its institutional
and other clients. In evaluating the fees associated with PIM's client
accounts, the Trustees took into account the respective demands, resources and
complexity associated with the Trust and client accounts. The Trustees noted
that in some instances the fee rates for those clients were lower than the
management fee for the Trust and considered that, under the investment advisory
agreement with the Trust, PIM performs additional services for the Trust that
it does not provide to those other clients or services that are broader in
scope, including oversight of the Trust's other service providers and
activities related to compliance and the extensive regulatory and tax regimes
to which the Trust is subject. The Trustees concluded that the management fee
payable by the Trust to PIM was reasonable in relation to the nature and
quality of the services provided by PIM. The Trustees also concluded that the
Trust's expense ratio was reasonable taking into account the nature and quality
of services provided by PIM.

Profitability
The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the
financial results realized by PIM and its affiliates from non-fund businesses.
The Trustees considered PIM's profit margins with respect to the Trust in
comparison to the limited industry data available and noted that the
profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors, including its
organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The Trustees
concluded that PIM's profitability with respect to the management of the Trust
was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale
The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is
a closed-end fund that has not raised additional capital, the Trustees

<PAGE>

concluded that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration in the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits
The Trustees considered the other benefits to PIM from its relationship with
the Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
Trust, other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services
provided by PIM and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the
revenues and profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business.
The Trustees considered the intangible benefits to PIM by virtue of its
relationship with the Trust and the other Pioneer funds. The Trustees concluded
that the receipt of these benefits was reasonable in the context of the overall
relationship between PIM and the Trust.

Conclusion
After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors,
the Trustees, including all of the independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, was fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into
on or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the new
SEC pre-approval rules, the Fund's audit committee is
required to pre-approve services to affiliates defined by
SEC rules to the extent that the services are determined
to have a direct impact on the operations or financial
reporting of the Fund.  For the years ended November
30, 2010 and 2009, there were no services provided to an
affiliate that required the Fund's audit committee pre-
approval.

(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.


The aggregate non-audit fees for the Fund and affiliates,
as previously defined, totaled approximately $17,942 in
2010 and $17,940 in 2009.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees has
considered whether the provision of non-audit services
that were rendered to the Affiliates (as defined) that were
not pre- approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
maintaining the principal accountant's independence.


(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees has

approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
 audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,

		    Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

       o    Classified boards of closed-end mutual funds, but will typically
            support such proposals.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

                                       16

Potential Conflicts of Interest. When a portfolio manager is responsible for the
management of more than one account, the potential arises for the portfolio
manager to favor one account over another. The principal types of potential
conflicts of interest that may arise are discussed below. For the reasons
outlined below, Pioneer does not believe that any material conflicts are likely
to arise out of a portfolio manager's responsibility for the management of the
fund as well as one or more other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted
procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to detect and prevent
violations of the federal securities laws and to mitigate the potential for
conflicts of interest to affect its portfolio management decisions, there can be
no assurance that all conflicts will be identified or that all procedures will
be effective in mitigating the potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of
such conflicts of interest are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager
has a financial incentive to favor one account over another. Pioneer has
structured its compensation arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit
such potential for conflicts of interest. See "Compensation of Portfolio
Managers" below.

     o    A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating
          new investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial
          public offerings and private  placements.  If, for example, an initial
          public offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly
          shortly  after the offering was  allocated to a single  account,  that
          account may be expected to have  better  investment  performance  than
          other  accounts  that did not  receive an  allocation  of the  initial
          public  offering.  Generally,  investments  for which there is limited
          availability  are  allocated  based upon a range of factors  including
          available  cash  and   consistency   with  the  accounts'   investment
          objectives  and  policies.  This  allocation  methodology  necessarily
          involves some  subjective  elements but is intended over time to treat
          each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
          opportunity is allocated  among  participating  accounts on a pro rata
          basis.  Although  Pioneer  believes that its practices are  reasonably
          designed to treat each client in an equitable  and fair manner,  there
          may be instances where a fund may not participate,  or may participate
          to a  lesser  degree  than  other  clients,  in the  allocation  of an
          investment opportunity.

     o    A portfolio  manager could favor one account over another in the order
          in which trades for the accounts  are placed.  If a portfolio  manager
          determines  to  purchase  a security  for more than one  account in an
          aggregate  amount that may influence the market price of the security,
          accounts that  purchased or sold the security first may receive a more
          favorable price than accounts that made subsequent  transactions.  The
          less liquid the market for the security or the greater the  percentage
          that the proposed  aggregate  purchases or sales  represent of average
          daily trading volume, the greater the potential for accounts that make
          subsequent  purchases or sales to receive a less favorable price. When
          a portfolio manager intends to trade the same security on the same day
          for more than one account,  the trades  typically are "bunched," which
          means that the trades for the  individual  accounts are aggregated and
          each account receives the same price. There are some types of accounts
          as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons (such
          as  directed  brokerage  arrangements).  Circumstances  may also arise
          where the trader  believes  that bunching the orders may not result in
          the best possible  price.  Where those accounts or  circumstances  are
          involved,  Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result
          in as favorable a price as possible for such client.

     o    A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio  manager's
          compensation  is tied to the  performance of that account to a greater
          degree than other accounts managed by the portfolio  manager.  If, for
          example,  the  portfolio  manager  receives  a bonus  based  upon  the
          performance of certain  accounts  relative to a benchmark  while other
          accounts are disregarded for this purpose,  the portfolio manager will
          have a financial incentive to seek to have the accounts that determine
          the portfolio manager's bonus achieve the best possible performance to
          the  possible  detriment  of other  accounts.  Similarly,  if  Pioneer
          receives a  performance-based  advisory fee, the portfolio manager may
          favor that  account,  whether or not the  performance  of that account
          directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

     o    A portfolio  manager could favor an account if the  portfolio  manager
          has a beneficial  interest in the account, in order to benefit a large
          client or to compensate a client that had poor  returns.  For example,
          if the portfolio manager held an interest in an investment partnership
          that was one of the accounts  managed by the  portfolio  manager,  the
          portfolio  manager  would  have an  economic  incentive  to favor  the
          account in which the portfolio manager held an interest.

     o    If the different accounts have materially and potentially  conflicting
          investment  objectives  or  strategies,  a conflict of interest  could
          arise. For example,  if a portfolio  manager  purchases a security for
          one account and sells the same  security  for  another  account,  such
          trading  pattern may  disadvantage  either the account that is long or
          short. In making portfolio manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid
          such potentially  conflicting  situations.  However, where a portfolio
          manager  is  responsible   for  accounts  with  differing   investment
          objectives  and policies,  it is possible  that the portfolio  manager
          will conclude that it is in the best interest of one account to sell a
          portfolio security while another account continues to hold or increase
          the holding in such security.


Compensation of Portfolio Managers. Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation
for portfolio managers that seeks to align the financial interests of the
portfolio managers with those of shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer
funds) the portfolio managers manage, as well as with the financial performance
of Pioneer. The compensation program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes
a base salary (determined by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual
bonus program, as well as customary benefits that are offered generally to all
full-time employees. Base compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an
annual basis. Pioneer seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking
into account the experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The
bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment
performance and align the interests of the investment professional with those of
shareholders, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus
under the plan is completely discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may
be in excess of base salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the
following factors:

 o        Quantitative  Investment  Performance.   The  quantitative  investment
          performance  calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of
          all of the accounts  managed by the portfolio  manager (which includes
          the fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over
          a  one-year   period  (20%   weighting)  and  four-year   period  (80%
          weighting),  measured for periods ending on December 31. The accounts,
          which  include the fund,  are ranked  against a group of mutual  funds
          with similar  investment  objectives and investment  focus (60%) and a
          broad-based  securities  market index measuring the performance of the
          same type of securities in which the accounts invest (40%),  which, in
          the case of the fund,  is the  Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index
          As a result of these two benchmarks, the performance
          of the portfolio manager for compensation purposes is measured against
          the criteria that are relevant to the portfolio manager's  competitive
          universe.

o        Qualitative Performance. The qualitative performance component with
         respect to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager
         includes objectives, such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork,
         leadership, communications and marketing, that are mutually established
         and evaluated by each portfolio manager and management.

o        Pioneer Results and Business Line Results. Pioneer's financial
         performance, as well as the investment performance of its investment
         management group, affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a
         leverage factor of plus or minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers may participate in other programs designed to reward
and retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees may be
granted performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredit and
the financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., which are
affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

Item 9. Purchases of Equity Securities by Closed-End Management
Investment Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrants equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781). Instruction to paragraph (a). Disclose
all purchases covered by this Item, including purchases that do not
satisfy the conditions of the safe harbor of Rule 10b-18 under the
Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18), made in the period covered by the
report. Provide disclosures covering repurchases made on a monthly basis.
For example, if the reporting period began on January 16 and ended on
July 15, the chart would show repurchases for the months from January 16
through February 15, February 16 through March 15, March 16 through
April 15, April 16 through May 15, May 16 through June 15, and June 16
through July 15.

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.


Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrants board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G)
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrants board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14(A) in
its definitive proxy statement, or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive officer or
officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing
similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based
on their evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose whether or not there were significant changes in the registrant's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

There were no significant changes in the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second
fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit.



(b) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2 under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2).

Filed herewith.
