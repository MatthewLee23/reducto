(1) Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
    beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
    period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
    of all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the
    period indicated.

(2) Distribution rate represents the monthly annualized distributions of the
    Trust at the end of the period and not the earnings of the Trust.

(3) The taxable-equivalent distribution rate is calculated assuming the maximum
    40.3% combined federal and state income tax rate effective for calendar year
    2003, which takes into consideration the deductibility of individual state
    taxes paid.

(4) See "Notes to Financial Statements" footnote #5, for more information
    concerning Preferred Share reset periods.

    A portion of the interest income may be taxable for those investors subject
    to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).

    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return,
    common share market price and net asset value will fluctuate and Trust
    shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. An
    investment in the Trust is subject to investment risks, and you could lose
    money on your investment in the Trust. As a result of recent market
    activity, current performance may vary from the figures shown. For more
    up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or speak with your
    financial advisor.

The solid line above represents the trust's net asset value (NAV), which
indicates overall changes in value among the trust's underlying securities. The
trust's common share market price is represented by the dashed line, which
indicates the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a
given time. Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors,
including supply and demand and market conditions.

Q&A WITH YOUR PORTFOLIO MANAGER

WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH THE MANAGEMENT TEAM OF VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE
MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST ABOUT THE KEY EVENTS AND ECONOMIC FORCES THAT SHAPED THE
MARKETS AND INFLUENCED THE TRUST'S RETURN DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,
2003. DENNIS PIETRZAK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HAS MANAGED THE TRUST SINCE 1995 AND
HAS WORKED IN THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY SINCE 1968. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION
REFLECTS HIS VIEWS ON THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE.

Q   WHAT WAS THE MARKET
    ENVIRONMENT OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS?

A   The environment over the past six
months has been defined by two major themes. The first of these was the level of
interest rates. The period began with interest rates at levels not seen in over
three decades and, surprisingly for many, ended with rates slightly lower. The
Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) helped keep rates low with a widely anticipated
rate cut in November, driven by economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk. The
low level of rates led to a boom in issuance by municipalities seeking to lock
in low financing costs. As a result, issuance reached a record level of $354
billion in 2002 and continued to be exceptional in the first quarter of 2003.

    The other theme in the market during the period was the relative
attractiveness of municipal bonds, which produced enough demand to absorb the
record issuance. Investors, wary of volatility in the equity market and in the
geopolitical arena, flocked to perceived safe haven investments. Their risk
aversion counteracted growing expectations for economic recovery and rising
interest rates, and was a key factor in keeping interest rates at historically
low levels. In their ongoing preference for low-risk assets, investors bid
Treasury prices up to such high levels that municipal bonds became as
attractively valued as they have ever been relative to Treasuries. Insurance
companies also moved heavily into municipal bonds as their mainstay corporate
bond holdings became less attractive. At the same time, issuers recognized
investor concerns over economic weakness by insuring roughly 50 percent of all
issuance. This credit enhancement feature made municipal bonds even more
attractive to risk-averse investors.

    While lower financing costs were a boon to municipal issuers, the continuing
weakness in the economy had a negative impact on municipal credit quality,
particularly in the first quarter of 2003. Moody's upgrades barely exceeded the
number of downgrades in the first quarter, with credit quality facing continued
pressure

                                        4

from rising social service costs and weak national and regional economic
conditions. As a result, municipalities face enormous deficits in 2003, when
their combined shortfall is expected to reach $90 billion.

    Performance along the yield curve was varied. The Fed's November rate cut
fueled a rally in short-term bonds that helped pull yields lower at the front
end of the curve. Despite that rally, the best performing segment of the curve
was the long-intermediate portion where performance was largely driven by buying
activity among institutional investors drawn by the bonds' attractive total
return potential.

    While it has been slow, the Pennsylvania economy has fared relatively well
compared to many other big states. Pennsylvania's government has a history of
fiscal restraint that has served the state well in such situations. The state
also has a long tradition of actively refinancing its debt to lock in lower
financing rates during periods of low or falling interest rates, and the past
six months were no exception.

Q   HOW DID THE TRUST PERFORM IN
    THIS ENVIRONMENT?

A   The trust's monthly dividend of
$0.0890 per share translated to a distribution rate of 6.70 percent based on the
trust's closing common share market price on April 30, 2003. Based on these
figures, investors would have to earn a distribution rate of 11.22 percent on a
taxable investment (for an investor in the 40.30 percent combined federal and
state income tax bracket) to match the tax-exempt yield provided by the trust.

    For the six months through April 30, 2003, the trust produced a total return
of 4.00 percent based on common share market price. By comparison, the Lehman
Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index posted a total return of 3.79 percent
for the same period. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future
results. Investment return, common share market price and net asset value will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. As a result of recent market activity, current performance may
vary from the figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit
vankampen.com or speak with your financial advisor.

    The Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged,
broad-based statistical composite of municipal bonds. Index returns do not
include any sales charges or fees that would be paid by an investor purchasing
the securities the index represents. Such costs would lower performance. It is
not possible to invest directly in an index. For additional information, please
refer to the performance summary section.

Q   WHAT STRATEGIES DID YOU PURSUE
    IN MANAGING THE TRUST?

A   With yields hovering near record
lows, we focused on protecting the trust from the potential adverse effects of
rising interest rates while maintaining the trust's yield. One of our primary
methods for doing this was to purchase premium bonds with maturities of between
15 and 20 years. Our quantitative analysis showed that this segment of the yield
curve offered the optimal combination of total return

                                        5
<PAGE>

potential as well as the potential for downside protection in the form of a
comfortable yield cushion and an intermediate maturity profile.

    The funds for these purchases came from a number of sources. Some of the
portfolio's holdings were called by their issuers, and we sold others that were
prerefunded. We also trimmed the trust's exposure to deep discount bonds with
coupons below 5 percent when retail investors bid the bonds' prices up to
attractive levels.

    While the trust remained well diversified, our trading activity did have
some effect on the portfolio's sector composition. The largest sector change was
in the trust's transportation holdings. Several of the deep discount issues that
we sold were from issuers such as the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit
Authority (SEPTA) and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. These sales resulted in a 5
percent reduction in the portfolio's transportation exposure.

** Amount is less than .01.

(a) Net Asset Value at April 30, 1993, is adjusted for common and preferred
    share offering costs of $.313 per common share.

(b) Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
    beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
    period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
    of all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the
    period indicated.

(c) As required, effective November 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the
    provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies
    and began accreting market discount on fixed income securities. The effect

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered
as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is
to provide a high level of current income exempt from federal and Pennsylvania
income taxes and, where possible under local law, local income and personal
property taxes, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest
substantially all of its assets in Pennsylvania municipal securities rated
investment grade at the time of investment. The Trust commenced investment
operations on April 30, 1993.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
maintain, in a segregated account with its custodian, assets having an aggregate
value at least equal to the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery
purchase commitments until payment is made. As of April 30, 2003, the Trust had
$2,693,845 of when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset these losses against any future realized gains. At
October 31, 2002, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward for tax
purposes of $1,845,346, which will expire between October 31, 2003 and October
31, 2007. Of this amount, $1,657,295 will expire on October 31, 2003.

    At April 30, 2003, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually on a pro rata basis to common and preferred
shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may
include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax
purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended October 31,
2002 was as follows:

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND
OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen
Investment Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and
facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .60% of the average
daily net assets of the Trust. In addition, the Trust will pay a monthly
administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc. or its affiliates
(collectively "Van Kampen"), the Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of
..05% of the average daily net assets of the Trust. The administrative services
provided by the Administrator include record keeping and reporting
responsibilities with respect to the Trust's portfolio and preferred shares and
providing certain services to shareholders.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $3,100 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher, & Flom (Illinois), counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of
the Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the six months ended
April 30, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $13,100
representing Van Kampen's cost of providing accounting and legal services to the
Trust, which are reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively,
in the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $14,474,053 and $13,797,247,
respectively.

5. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust has outstanding 1,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"). Dividends are
cumulative and the dividend rate is currently reset every seven days through an
auction process. The rate in effect on April 30, 2003 was 1.150%. During the six
months ended April 30, 2003, the rates ranged from 0.900% to 1.600%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may seek to manage the portfolio's interest rate exposure in a
changing interest rate environment by engaging in transactions involving
interest rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into
these transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or
fixed-income market changes, for duration management purposes or for risk
management purposes but may also enter into these transactions to generate
additional income. Risks may arise as a result of the potential inability of the
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts or agreements. During the
six months ended April 30, 2003, the Trust did not enter into any of these
transactions.

I, Ronald E. Robison, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value
     Municipal Income Trust;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
     information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
     subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
     particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
     procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this
     report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

c)   presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
     disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of the
     Evaluation Date;

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
     controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
     process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
     registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
     controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.
