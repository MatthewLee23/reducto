                              PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

The First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the
"Fund") generated a total return of 6.21%, including market price change and
dividends, for the six-month period ending November 30, 2006 (the "Fiscal
Period"). The Fund's Net Asset Value ("NAV") total return over the same period
was 3.16%. During the Fiscal Period, the Fund increased its dividend three times
and declared dividends totaling $0.7343 per common share compared to $0.5922 for
the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of 24.0%. The Fund's
common share price increased 1.9% during the Fiscal Period from $17.61 to
$17.95, and its discount to NAV narrowed from 7.3% to 4.6%. Based on its most
recent dividend, FCT paid a yield of 8.48% calculated on the Fund's common share
price and 8.09% based on the Fund's $18.81 NAV as of November 30, 2006.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The Fiscal Period continued to be a positive environment for Senior Loan
investing. The Fund continued to benefit from an attractive credit environment
primarily due to a strong U.S. economy, which kept market-wide default rates at
very low levels. Additionally, continued strong investor demand for the Senior
Loan asset class due to its appealing risk-adjusted returns relative to other
investment opportunities has kept secondary prices firm across the Senior Loan
market. This combination of low default rates and firm secondary prices has
resulted in stable NAV returns.

GDP continued to expand during the period, including the recent upward revision
to third-quarter GDP to 2.2%. Corporate earnings growth remained strong during
the period and, while interest rates have increased, real rates remain low on a
historical basis. The Fund primarily invests in the loans of non-investment
grade companies, and strong earnings, combined with low real interest rates,
make these companies better able to service their debt.

The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") has not changed the Federal Funds rate
target (set at 5.25%) since its June 29, 2006 meeting. While the Fed policy
makers continue to maintain a tightening bias, they are predicting that economic
growth will run slightly below the trend for the next year. Signs of a slowdown
in GDP growth domestically and internationally have emerged which have, among
other indicators, led some economists to predict a hiatus in Fed tightening
during Fiscal 2007.

                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we acknowledge these signals and the significant rise in interest rates
since 2003, we believe that the fundamental strength of the economy, combined
with the Fed's overriding focus on containing inflation, may result in further
interest rate increases.

From the Fund's perspective, these are very favorable conditions. A tightening
bias increases the possibility that the Fund can continue to increase its
dividend since the loans that the fund invests in are floating rate and their
income is based on short-term interest rates. However, excessive tightening
could result in a spike in real interest rates, hurting companies' ability to
service their debt. While we do not expect corporate earnings to sustain their
year-over-year double digit growth levels, earnings are generally expected to
remain relatively strong through 2007, which, combined with low real interest
rates, should continue to enable the companies in which we invest to service
their debt.

Unlike traditional fixed income investments (i.e. high yield bonds), Senior
Loans have minimal, if any, interest rate risk. Rather, in rising rate
environments like we have seen in recent years, Senior Loan income typically
rises (with a several month lag) along with Fed rate increases. One caveat
however, is that in recent years, narrowing credit spread has partly offset the
benefits from rising rates. Notwithstanding the modest decline in credit
spreads, the Fund still increased its dividend 12 times since the Fed tightening
began and has demonstrated low NAV volatility. More recently, we have seen
credit spreads trend somewhat higher. Loan market liquidity has also improved
during the period.

Inflows into the Senior Loan asset class during Calendar 2006 were exceptional
and occurred in tandem with strong growth in new Senior Loan issuance. New
Senior Loan issuance rose over 37% year-over-year through November to $457
billion. In November alone, there was $66 billion of new Senior Loan issuance.
The forward calendar remains very robust with a visible pipeline of $54 billion
already scheduled for 2007. Similarly, secondary trading volume grew nearly 34%
year-over year.

As previously mentioned, the demand for the asset class of Senior Loans remained
strong, as investors perceived reduced levels of risk resulting from an
improving economic environment and low levels of defaults and credit losses, as
well as the returns benefit of a floating-rate asset class. For the six months
ended November 30, Senior Loans generated a total return of 3.19% (S&P/LSTA
Leveraged Loan Index). Senior Loans have generated positive returns every
calendar year that the data has been tracked since 1992.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

The primary objective of the Fund is to seek a high level
of current income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve
capital. The investment strategy employed in managing the Fund was designed to
achieve the Fund's objectives through risk minimization throughout entire
economic and credit cycles. In contrast, many managers of Senior Loan-based
closed-end funds invest up to 20% or more of their portfolios in high yield
bonds in order to boost yields in the short run. FCT utilizes a "pure play"
strategy that generally prohibits the Fund from investing in high yield bonds,
and focuses primarily on Senior Loans. In some market environments, the Fund's
pure play strategy may result in lower current dividends/yields than some other
Senior Loan-based closed-end funds. However, we believe that our strategy can
result in lower NAV volatility while maintaining competitive dividends/yield and
higher and more stable long-term total NAV returns.

Our strategy focuses on thorough fundamental credit analysis, broad issuer and
industry diversification, and a pro-active sell discipline in order to minimize
risk. The Fund's portfolio is generally more heavily weighted towards industry
groups that we expect to exhibit lower earnings volatility, and which we expect
to provide high recoveries to senior lenders in circumstances where earnings
volatility does occur.

The Fund is well diversified with over 200 positions across 31 industries. At
November 30, 2006 the five largest individual borrower exposures in total
represented 9.1% of the Fund's portfolio. The Fund also has the flexibility to
invest up to 10% of the portfolio in Special Situation debt investments, which
are typically investments in companies that are either in default at the time of
purchase or are experiencing financial difficulties. We view our ability to
achieve modest gains from this subset of Senior Loans as opportunistic rather
than obligatory, and given the growth and improvement in the economy in recent
years, we have seen limited value opportunities in this segment of the
portfolio. On November 30, 2006, the portfolio included one Special Situation
investment representing 2.3% of the Fund's portfolio.

As mentioned in prior reports, the Fund is leveraged using both adjustable-rate
Auction Market Preferred Shares and an asset-backed commercial paper conduit.
The terms and conditions of the leverage provide the Fund with the ability to
borrow on a floating-rate basis. Since the income generated by the Fund's Senior
Loan investment portfolio is also floating-rate, the Fund is less exposed to
interest rate mismatch risk than a closed-end fund with a fixed-rate investment
portfolio, and investors will generally benefit from portfolio leverage
regardless of short-term interest rates. At November 30, 2006, the portfolio
leverage accounted for 36.3% of the Fund's total managed assets.

                                                                          Page 3

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

FCT generated a total return of 6.21%, including market price change and
dividends, for the Fiscal Period. The Fund's NAV total return was 3.16% over the
same period. This return slightly lagged the benchmark (Standard & Poor's/LSTA
Leveraged Loan Index) return of 3.19%. The Fund's performance includes the
beneficial impact of leverage, and the negative impact of fees, expenses and
uninvested cash balances, which are not part of the benchmark return. The
dividend distribution totaled approximately $0.7343 per common share during the
Fiscal Period. FCT paid an annualized yield of 8.48% calculated on the Fund's
common share price and 8.09% based on the Fund's $18.81 NAV as of November 30,
2006. Additionally, the Fund's NAV was relatively stable during the period,
ranging from a high of $19.00 to a low of $18.69, a range of approximately
1.66%.

In addition to the Fund's stable NAV performance/total return and high yield
during the Fiscal Period, the Fund's market price performance improved. During
the period, the market price of the Fund closed as high as $17.95 (November 30,
2006) and as low as $17.53 (June 13, 2006). The Fund ended the period at a 4.6%
discount to its NAV compared to a discount of 7.3% at the beginning of the
period. We also note that 13 of the 16 Senior Loan closed-end funds traded at
discounts to NAV on November 30, with the average of the narrower pure play
group (six of the 16 Senior Loan closed-end funds referred to above) being 3.7%.
FCT's annualized market and NAV yield on November 30, 2006 (8.5% and 8.1%,
respectively) compare favorably to the pure play peer group average of 8.3% and
8.0%, respectively.

On June 1st, AG Edwards issued its research report with a Buy rating, the firm's
highest rating. Other closed end fund research analysts have also published
proprietary research on the Fund, available within their specific firms.

We remain committed to long-term performance and superior client support, and we
appreciate the opportunity to assist investors in meeting their investment
goals.

              o All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based
                on net assets applicable to Common Shares.
            (a) This Senior Loan Interest was privately rated upon issuance. The
                rating agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the
                rating.
            (b) Aggregate cost for federal income tax and financial reporting
                purposes.
            (c) This issue is secured by a second lien on the issuer's assets.
            (d) This issue is unsecured.
            (e) Securities are restricted and cannot be offered for public sale
                without first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
                as amended (Note 2E).
            (f) This borrower has filed for protection in a federal bankruptcy
                court.
            (g) This Senior Loan Interest was purchased subsequent to the
                borrower's filing for protection in federal bankruptcy court and
                has priority over other debt holders.
            (h) Payment-in-Kind
            (i) This Senior Loan Interest is non-income producing.
             +  Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- by
                Standard & Poor's Ratings Group are considered to be below
                investment grade.
            NR  Not rated
           TBA  To be announced.
             *  Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
                prepayment. Prepayments of Senior Loans may occur because of the
                mandatory prepayment conditions and because there may be
                significant economic incentives for a borrower to optionally
                prepay. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior
                Loans may be substantially less than the stated maturities
                shown. Senior Loans generally have maturities that range from
                five to eight years; however, the Fund estimates that
                refinancing and prepayments result in an average maturity of the
                Senior Loans held in its portfolio to be approximately 18-30
                months.
            **  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at
                rates which are periodically predetermined by reference to a
                base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are
                generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major
                European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
                ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
                United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)


                              1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The
Fund will pursue these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets less any accrued
liabilities. The NAV is determined as of the close of regular trading on the
NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting
the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. The Fund
calculates NAV per Common Share by subtracting the Fund's liabilities (including
accrued expenses, dividends payable and any borrowings of the Fund) and the
liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred Shares from the Fund's Total
Assets (the value of securities and other investments the Fund holds plus cash
or other assets, including interest accrued but not yet received), and dividing
the result by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the principal markets for
particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities), but before
the Fund values its assets, would materially affect NAV, First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities
and investments. The use of fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as

                          NOVEMBER 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than one securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such
value is being determined at the close of the exchange representing the
principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities traded in the
over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the NASDAQ, are
valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature in less
than 60 days are valued at amortized cost.

B. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid assets with a
current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

D. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded loan commitments of approximately $7,323,628
as of November 30, 2006. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at
the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation of $33,635 from these
commitments is included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in restricted securities. Restricted
securities are securities that cannot be offered for public sale without first
being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Fund
currently holds the restricted securities shown in the following table. The Fund
does not have the right to demand that such securities be registered. These
securities are valued using market quotations according to the valuation
procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation section (Note 2A) and are not
expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted
security. There are no unrestricted securities with the same maturity dates and
yields for these issuers.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

F. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2006 and May 31, 2005 is as follows:

                                                   2006                2005
Distributions paid from:
Ordinary Income ..........................  $   36,953,889       $   24,738,405

As of May 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income ............  $   3,191,642
Net Unrealized Appreciation ..............  $     914,840

G. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

As of May 31, 2006, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward for federal income
tax purposes of $4,136,367, expiring on May 31, 2014.

H. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

I. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes."
This pronouncement provides guidance on the recognition, measurement,
classification, and disclosures related to uncertain tax positions, along with
any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial statements which has not
yet been determined.

In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
157 Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157") was issued by the FASB and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage, L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross
asset value of the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP
Shares, and the principal amount of borrowings) minus the sum of the Fund's
accrued and unpaid dividends on any outstanding AMP Shares and accrued
liabilities.

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

The Fund pays each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust or
any of their affiliates an annual retainer of $10,000, which includes
compensation for all board and committee meetings. Trustees are also reimbursed
for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2006, were
$237,428,184 and $231,656,374, respectively.

As of November 30, 2006, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all
securities in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $2,066,566
and the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which
there was an excess of tax cost over value was $5,858,852.

                                5. COMMON SHARES

As of November 30, 2006, 25,272,768 of $0.01 par value Common Shares were
issued. An unlimited number of Common Shares have been authorized under the
Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of November 30, 2006, the Fund
has 2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP
Shares") outstanding at a liquidation value of $25,000 per share.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of November 30, 2006 was 5.28%. The
dividend rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. The high and low annual dividend rates during the six
months ended November 30, 2006, were 5.31% and 4.98%, and the average dividend
rate was 5.21%. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly to the
income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to Common
Shareholders.

                                                                         Page 27

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund has entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit
Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be
used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of
July 30, 2007. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the
Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total
assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$195,000,000. For the six months ended November 30, 2006, the average amount
outstanding was $172,956,284. The high and low annual interest rates during the
six months ended November 30, 2006, were 5.29% and 4.99%, respectively, with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.26%. The annual interest rate in effect at
November 30, 2006 was 5.29%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs,
which include an administration fee of 0.02%, a program fee of 0.20% and a
liquidity fee of 0.14% per year. Such expenses are included in "Interest and
fees on outstanding loan payable" on the Statement of Operations.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On November 20, 2006, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.1268 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record December 5, 2006, payable December 12, 2006.

On December 18, 2006, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.1268 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record December 29, 2006, payable January 16, 2007.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund adopted a compensation policy pursuant to
which, effective January 1, 2007, the Independent Trustees shall be paid an
annual retainer of $10,000 by each investment company of the First Trust Fund
Complex up to a total of 14 investment companies (the "Trustees Compensation I")
and an annual retainer of $7,500 by each subsequent investment company added to
the First Trust Fund Complex (the "Trustees Compensation II" and together with
Trustees Compensation I, the "Aggregate Trustee Compensation"). The Aggregate
Trustee Compensation shall be divided equally among each of the investment
companies in the First Trust Fund Complex. No additional meeting fees are paid
in connection with regular board or committee meetings. The Trustees shall also
be paid $1,000 for each meeting held in connection with the organization of a
new investment company for the First Trust Fund Complex. These additional fees
are paid by First Trust. Trustees are also reimbursed for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings.

Additionally, Mr. Kadlec is paid annual compensation of $10,000 to serve as the
Lead Independent Trustee and Niel B. Nielson is paid annual compensation of
$5,000 to serve as the chairman of the Audit Committee of each of the investment
companies in the First Trust Fund Complex. Such additional compensation to
Messrs. Kadlec and Nielson are paid by the investment companies in the First
Trust Fund Complex and the fees are divided equally among those investment
companies.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PFPC
Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Plan. If you
elect to receive cash distributions, you will receive all distributions in cash
paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc., as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

         (1) If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
             the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
             equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
             (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

         (2) If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation,
             the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash
             and will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
             elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
             market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
             Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
             price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
             at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
             than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
             issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
             distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the
             open market within 30 days of the valuation date except where
             temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to
             comply with federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on
             any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

       reporting  (as  defined  in Rule  30a-3(d)  under  the  1940  Act (17 CFR
       270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's second fiscal quarter
