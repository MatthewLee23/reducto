Performance commentary

Two factors drove positive performance for the high-yield, lower-quality
bonds in the fund's portfolio, enabling its results at NAV to surpass
those of its benchmark during the six months ended October 31, 2004. The
first factor was the improving economic climate, which increased
investor confidence in the relative financial stability of many
lower-rated bond issuers, lifting the price of the bonds. The second
factor was investor demand for higher-yielding municipal debt, which
increased while supply remained relatively small, driving up prices of
these bonds. The fund's position in lower-rated bonds also helped it
perform, at NAV, in line with its Lipper peer group average, in spite of
the fund's relatively conservative duration during the period. It is
important to note that a fund's performance at market price may differ
from its results at NAV. Although market price performance generally
reflects investment results, it may also be influenced by several other
factors, including changes in investor perceptions of the fund or its
investment advisor, market conditions, fluctuations in supply and demand
for the fund's shares, and changes in fund distributions.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust seeks to provide high current
income free from federal income tax consistent with the preservation of
capital, by investing in investment-grade and some below-investment-
grade municipal bonds. The fund may be appropriate for investors seeking
tax-free income and who are willing to accept a moderate degree of risk.


Market overview

Over the past six months, which constitute the first half of your fund's
2005 fiscal year, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell, and bond
prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, rose. In
mid-March, the bond market had begun to anticipate a change in the
Federal Reserve Board's (the Fed) monetary policy. Treasury bonds sold
off sharply and pushed yields upward, as strong economic growth and
rising corporate profitability increased the likelihood that the Fed
would raise short-term interest rates at its June 30 meeting.
Interestingly, when the Fed announced what had been a widely anticipated
25-basis-point increase, the bond market changed its course. Yields of
bonds with maturities in the range of 11-21 years trended downward. At
the same time, yields rose for bonds with short maturities and those
with very long maturities (over 21 years). This resulted in a flattening
of the yield curve -- that is, shorter- and longer-term interest rates
began to converge.

Among uninsured bonds and bonds rated A and below, yield spreads
remained essentially flat for the period. However, these higher-yielding
securities continued to provide attractive income streams that
contributed to the fund's total return during the period. Municipal
bonds issued by the State of California were generally strong
performers. The California economy improved to such an extent that three
bond-rating agencies -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch --
upgraded the state's credit rating. Tobacco settlement bonds performed
fairly well during the period. Yields on these bonds varied with the
results of ongoing legal battles, but declined overall since May, and
their prices rose accordingly. Airline-related industrial development
bonds (IDBs) performed poorly in general, as the industry continued to
face financial difficulties that were made worse by record high oil
prices. New York City general obligation (GO) bonds rose in price over
the past six months, reflecting a dearth of new issuance, as well as
investors' confidence in improving economic prospects for the city.

Strategy overview

Because we believe that the Fed is likely to continue to raise
short-term interest rates through mid-2005, we have positioned the
portfolio more defensively. This involves shortening the fund's
duration, which means reducing its sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. To accomplish this, we began the process of selling longer-term
bonds and replacing them with shorter-term bonds, which have a shorter
duration. Meanwhile, we continued to trim and diversify the fund's
positions in uninsured bonds and bonds rated A and below, which have
performed strongly. We maintained a neutral position, relative to the
fund's benchmark, in California municipal bonds, which were in high
demand as that state got its fiscal house in order and its debt rating
was upgraded by the major bond-rating agencies. The fund maintained its
overweight position in tobacco settlement bonds. We closely monitored
developments in that sector. The fund had less exposure to
airline-related IDBs during the period than did its peers.

In previous fiscal years, the fund emphasized non-callable bonds --
bonds that the issuer is not permitted to redeem (or call) before the
maturity date. These issues performed well as rates fell through March
2004, but during the spring we began to moderate this position, selling
non-callable bonds and purchasing callable issues scheduled to mature in
the 15- to 20-year range. We believe callable bonds may perform better
than non-callable bonds if interest rates rise and the yield curve
flattens further.

This chart compares changes in the fund's duration (a measure of its
sensitivity to interest-rate changes) and its average effective maturity
(a weighted average of the holdings' maturities).

Average effective maturity also takes into account put and call
features, where applicable, and reflects prepayments for mortgage-backed
securities.



How fund holdings affected performance

When economic growth improves, the chances of a company or municipality
defaulting on its bond payments generally decrease, which can boost the
prices of lower-rated bonds significantly. The more credit-sensitive
pockets of the market benefited from this trend, as well as increased
demand from investors who were hungry for yield in a low-interest-rate
environment. Consequently, the fund's focus on lower-rate bonds helped
performance substantially. While we emphasize lower-quality bonds in
this fund's portfolio, we have also been trying to manage risk exposure
by diversifying holdings across a number of issuers, locations, and
sectors.

The fund was more conservatively positioned than its peers in terms of
its duration -- a measure of the fund's sensitivity to interest rates.
We shortened duration in an effort to preserve the fund's principal
value from an increase in interest rates that has yet to affect the
long-term end of the market. In spite of the Federal Reserve Board's
tightening, which sent short-term interest rates up, intermediate- to
longer-term rates actually fell, and the fund missed some of the
resulting capital appreci ation. However, we continue to believe our
cautious approach is warranted, and the positives that resulted from our
emphasis on yield offset any negative effects of our conservative
duration.

Price appreciation of the fund's New York City's general obligation (GO)
bonds illustrate the benefits of an improving economy and narrowing
credit spreads. GOs are backed by taxpayer receipts and reflect investor
perceptions of the financial strength of the issuing municipality. After
three consecutive years of decline, New York City's employment outlook
is finally improving. The private sector has been adding new jobs,
boosting the city's employment rate and tax revenues. Although its per
capita debt is still higher than the average for other U.S. cities, New
York City's fundamental outlook has stabilized, and two major bond-rating
organizations recently upgraded their outlook for the city, causing bond
prices to rise and narrowing the gap between these bonds and others
issued by municipalities that have higher ratings.

will vary over time.


The fund has a somewhat greater emphasis on tobacco settlement bonds
than many of its peers, which has proved beneficial in spite of the
volatile market environment for these issues. The payments from these
high-yielding bonds are secured by income promised to various states
through settlements from tobacco companies. This income could be
jeopardized as a result of multibillion-dollar judgments against the
companies, and prices in this sector have shifted as concerns about
litigation overshadowed optimism. Our analyst believes that, despite
several highly visible lawsuits against the tobacco industry, litigation
risk is receding from where it was in 1999. Also, long-term cigarette
consumption levels appear not to have been reduced. Considering the
risks, we have diversified the fund's investments in tobacco settlement
bonds and we remain watchful of the situation. Holdings include South
Carolina Tobacco Settlement revenue bonds and Badger Tobacco Settlement
Asset Securitization Corp. revenue bonds, issued in Wisconsin.

Although some airline-related industrial development bonds (IDBs) remain
in the portfolio, the fund's position in these securities is relatively
small. IDBs are bonds issued by municipalities but backed by the credit
of the company benefiting from the financing. Investor perceptions about
the backing company's health, or that of its industry group, affect the
prices of these bonds, not the rating of the municipality issuing them.
The airline industry has been under a cloud for several years, although
it regained some ground last year. However, the industry continues to
grapple with high operating costs and strong competition among carriers,
which is keeping the price of airline tickets down. These problems, plus
the ongoing threat of terrorism, make us cautious about the industry, so
we limited the fund's airline-related investments to what we believe to
be the strongest carriers.

Although high-yielding municipal securities generally performed well
during the past six months, there were a few individual securities that
had a negative impact on the fund's performance. Louisiana Development
Authority Revenue Bonds for St. James Place hurt the fund's performance.
St. James Place is a continuing-care retirement community. We purchased
these bonds originally in 1996, but over time the system suffered from
overly optimistic projections and marketing difficulties. We had been
hopeful that a turnaround was possible. However, recently we joined the
remaining bondholders in a tentative agreement to tender our bonds back
to the issuer in exchange for a position in a newer bond that more
closely reflects St. James's current income.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in
the future.



OF SPECIAL INTEREST

As short-term interest rates increased during the period, your fund's
portfolio was structured defensively in order to protect investors'
principle. This positioning helped the fund to provide positive relative
returns, although it did prompt a reduction of the fund's monthly
distribution from $0.0795 to $0.0735 per share in September 2004.



The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

Judging from the flattened yield curve, the bond market appears to have
largely shrugged off the recent Fed rate hikes. However, we believe that
interest rates all along the yield curve are more likely to rise than
fall. After the close of the fiscal period, the Fed again raised the
discount rate by 25 basis points, or one quarter of a percentage point.
Going forward, we anticipate greater increases for bonds with shorter
maturities because we believe the Fed will continue to raise short-term
rates incrementally through mid-2005. This also suggests further
flattening of the yield curve. The fund is positioned defensively in
terms of duration, and we will continue to monitor and adjust the fund's
duration as seems appropriate. We believe inflation will remain low,
despite the threat posed by high oil prices. We also anticipate that the
rate of GDP growth will slow during the next two quarters, as the
effects of the Fed's tightening policy are felt.

In general, these signs indicate that we are headed into a more
challenging environment for bond investing. Our task will be to continue
to search for the most attrac tive opportunities among tax-exempt
securities and to balance the pursuit of attractive current income with
prudent risk management.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. Lower-rated bonds
may offer higher yields in return for more risk. Capital gains, if any,
are taxable for federal and, in most cases, state purposes. For some
investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax. Income from federally exempt funds may be subject to state
and local taxes. Mutual funds that invest in bonds are subject to
certain risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, and inflation
risk. As interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds
are more exposed to interest-rate risk than short-term bonds. Unlike
bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses.

Terms and definitions

Total return shows how the value of the fund's shares changed over time,
assuming you held the shares through the entire period and reinvested
all distributions in the fund.

Net asset value (NAV) is the value of all your fund's assets, minus any
liabilities and the net assets allocated to auction rate municipal
preferred shares, divided by the number of outstanding common shares.

Market price is the current trading price of one share of the fund.
Market prices are set by transactions between buyers and sellers on
exchanges such as the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock
Exchange.

A note about duplicate mailings

In response to investors' requests, the SEC has modified mailing
regulations for proxy statements, semiannual and annual reports, and
prospectuses. Putnam is now able to send a single copy of these
materials to customers who share the same address. This change will
automatically apply to all shareholders except those who notify us. If
you would prefer to receive your own copy, please call Putnam at
1-800-225-1581.

Proxy voting

Putnam is committed to managing our mutual funds in the best interests
of our shareholders. The Putnam funds' proxy voting guidelines and
procedures, as well as information regarding how your fund voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities during the 12-month period ended June
30, 2004, are available on the Putnam Individual Investor Web site,
www.putnaminvestments.com/individual, and on the SEC's Web site,
www.sec.gov. If you have questions about finding forms on the SEC's Web
site, you may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may also obtain the
Putnam funds' proxy voting guidelines and procedures at no charge by
calling Putnam's Shareholder Services at 1-800-225-1581.

Fund portfolio holdings

For periods ending on or after July 9, 2004, the fund will file a
complete schedule of its portfolio holdings with the SEC for the first
and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. Shareholders may
obtain the fund's Forms N-Q on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov. In
addition, the fund's Forms N-Q may be reviewed and copied at the SEC's
public reference room in Washington, D.C. You may call the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330 for information about the SEC's Web site or the operation
of the public reference room.



A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
constitute the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss
the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by the fund's net investment gain or loss, by distributions to
shareholders, and by changes in the number of the fund's shares. It
lists distributions and their sources (net investment income or realized
capital gains) over the current reporting period and the most recent
fiscal year-end. The distributions listed here may not match the sources
listed in the Statement of operations because the distributions are
determined on a tax basis and may be paid in a different period from the
one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results,   per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment
income ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting
the five most recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the
highlight table also includes the current reporting period. For open-end
funds, a separate table is provided for each share class.

Notes to financial statements
October 31, 2004 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (the "fund"), a Massachusetts
business trust, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of
current income exempt from federal income tax and consistent with the
preservation of capital. The fund intends to achieve its objective by
investing primarily in a portfolio of investment grade municipal bonds
that Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's
manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC, believes to
be  consistent with preservation of capital.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued at fair
value on the basis of valuations provided by an independent pricing
service, approved by the Trustees. Such services use information with
respect to transactions in bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market
transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between
securities in determining value. Other investments are valued at fair
value following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is exe cuted). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts
are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in
excess of the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date;
thereafter, any remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") applicable
to regulated investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund
to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax
under Section 4982 of the Code, as amended. Therefore, no provision has
been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized
appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital
gains.

At April 30, 2004, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $19,135,231
available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the  expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover  Expiration
- ---------------------------
  $126,586      April 30, 2007
 2,788,662      April 30, 2008
 1,503,027      April 30, 2009
 2,243,569      April 30, 2010
 3,588,009      April 30, 2011
 8,885,378      April 30, 2012

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending April 30, 2005, $515,102 of losses recognized during the period
November 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004.

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $313,824,574, resulting
in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of $17,215,324 and
$3,567,196, respectively, or net unrealized  appreciation of
$13,648,128.

D) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded
on the ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on
remarketed preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by
the Trustees. Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares
is generally a 28-day period for Series A and a 7-day period for Series
B and Series C. The applicable dividend rate for the remarketed
preferred shares on October 31, 2004 was 1.39% for Series A, 1.70% for
Series B and 1.65% for Series C. The amount and character of income and
gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital accounts to
reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.

E) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares
is determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on 0.65% of the fund's average weekly net assets attributable
to common and preferred shares outstanding.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred
shares for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to
the proceeds of the remarketed preferred shares during that period, then
the fee payable to Putnam Management for that period will be reduced by
the amount of the excess (but not more than 0.65% of the liquidation
preference of the remarketed preferred shares outstanding during the
period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended October 31, 2004, the
fund paid PFTC $110,562 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended October 31,
2004, the fund's expenses were reduced by $20,648 under these
arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $710, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund, and
an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive
additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have served
as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension Plan are
equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and meeting fees for
the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense for the fund is
included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of
operations. Accrued pension liability is included in Payable for Trustee
compensation and expenses in the statement of assets and liabilities.The
Trustees have terminated the Pension Plan with respect to any Trustee first
elected after 2003.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended October 31, 2004, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than short-term
investments aggregated $72,373,893 and $76,495,542, respectively. There
were no purchases or sales of U.S. government securities.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A, B and C shares are redeemable at the option of the fund on
any dividend payment date at a redemption price of $50,000, $25,000 and
$25,000, respectively per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends
accumulated on a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption date
(whether or not such dividends have been declared) and, in certain
circumstances, a call premium.

It is anticipated that dividends paid to holders of remarketed preferred
shares will be considered tax-exempt dividends under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. To the extent that the fund earns taxable income
and capital gains by the conclusion of a fiscal year, it may be required
to apportion to the holders of the remarketed preferred shares
throughout that year additional dividends as necessary to result in an
after-tax equivalent to the applicable dividend rate for the period.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to
maintain asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed
preferred shares as of the last business day of each month in which any
such shares are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet
more stringent asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed
preferred shares and the shares' rating agencies. Should these
requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the remarketed
preferred shares not be paid, the fund may be restricted in its ability
to declare dividends to common shareholders or may be required to redeem
certain of the remarketed preferred shares. At October 31, 2004, no such
restrictions have been placed on the fund.

Note 5
Regulatory matters and litigation

On April 8, 2004, Putnam Management entered into agreements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Massachusetts
Securities Division representing a final settlement of all charges
brought against Putnam Management by those agencies on October 28, 2003
in connection with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees and,
in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities
Division, by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans. The
settlement with the SEC requires Putnam Management to pay $5 million in
disgorgement plus a civil monetary penalty of $50 million, and the
settlement with the Massachusetts Securities Division requires Putnam
Management to pay $5 million in restitution and an administrative fine
of $50 million. The settlements also leave intact the process
established under an earlier partial settlement with the SEC under which
Putnam Management agreed to pay the amount of restitution determined by
an independent consultant, which may exceed the disgorgement and
restitution amounts specified above, pursuant to a plan to be developed
by the independent consultant.

Putnam Management, and not the investors in any Putnam fund, will bear
all costs, including restitution, civil penalties and associated legal
fees stemming from both of these proceedings. The SEC's and
Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and related matters
also serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits, including
purported class action lawsuits filed against Putnam Management and
certain related parties, including certain Putnam funds. Putnam
Management has agreed to bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in
connection with these lawsuits. Based on currently available
information, Putnam Management believes that the likelihood that the
pending private lawsuits and purported class action lawsuits will have
a material adverse financial impact on the fund is remote, and the
pending actions are not likely to materially affect its ability to
provide investment management services to its clients, including the
Putnam funds.
