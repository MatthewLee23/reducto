In the first calendar quarter of 2004, there were several positive signs for the
general economy. Overall economic growth was solid and consumer sales continued
to be strong. Rebates, associated with recent tax reductions, are likely to make
additional resources available to consumers (although we hope that some of this
one time benefit will be allocated to savings). As of May 2004, the Federal
Reserve continues to maintain interest rates at historically low levels. And
after a relatively long period, it appears that there may be an upward trend in
the creation of new jobs. Furthermore, business activity appears to be
increasing. First quarter reports from a number of companies and sectors have
been positive. All these trends are encouraging for the short term. On the other
hand, there are also factors which give us concern. Energy prices are
increasing. We believe there is general concern that interest rates, while low,
will increase if and when the Federal Reserve reacts to the potential for
economic inflation. And, most concerning to us, is the geopolitical situation in
general and the conflict in Iraq, in particular. We are unclear about the exit
strategy in Iraq and worry about the intermediate term impact on the economy.
Overall, we think that the positives outlined above will dominate in the near
term but that there will be some volatility in stock prices. In the intermediate
term we are less certain.

As for the healthcare sector, we continue to be generally upbeat, particularly
in the long term. As we have said several times,

                                        1
<Page>

demographics favor this sector. The population is getting older and healthcare
spending increases as people age. Having said this, the first calendar quarter
of 2004 was not a good one for large pharmaceutical companies as they generally
lagged the broader market. Apparently, there is concern among investors about
product pipelines, pricing power and generic competition in the large pharma
group. In our view there is some basis for these concerns. However, we have
generally high regard for the management teams of companies in this group and
think, on a select basis, that there is opportunity for upside appreciation.

In contrast to the large pharma group, the biotechnology sector performed well
in the first quarter. This was likely due to continued evidence of maturation of
the group, as evidenced by product approvals and other positive developments.
Two products in the cancer area, Genentech's Avastin and Imclone's Erbitux have
been recently approved, and are of particular note. Many analysts believe these
will be very successful drugs. We think such approvals are crucial to the
general advancement of the group.

The recent development of the initial public offering market for biotechnology
stocks is also a good sign for the sector. More than a dozen companies have
completed IPOs in recent months after a period of several years in which there
was little or no market for such offerings. Furthermore, the stock price of a
good number of these stocks has risen since their IPO. A number of other
companies are in registration, with the intent to test the public market. We
think that the demand for new public companies is good for the sector and
encouraging for your Fund.

During the first calendar quarter of 2004, your Fund established positions in
Elan, Cyberonics, and Genta and increased its positions in Durect, Genzyme,
United Therapeutics and Vivus. Your Fund also made follow on investments in
TherOx and Zyomyx. In addition, one of the Fund's venture investments, Novacept,
was acquired by Cytyc. The Fund sold out of its position in Vicuron
Pharmaceuticals and EP MedSystems and decreased its ownership of deCODE
Genetics, Endocardial Solutions, and Sontra Medical.

As always, we encourage the Fund's shareholders to contact us with any questions
or concerns you may have relating to the Fund.

     If you are a registered shareholder of the Fund, the Fund and Hambrecht &
Quist Capital Management LLC, the Fund's investment adviser, may receive
nonpublic personal information about you from the information collected by the
transfer agent from your transactions in Fund shares. Any nonpublic personal
information is not disclosed to third parties, except as permitted or required
by law. In connection with servicing your account and effecting transactions,
the information received may be shared with the investment adviser and
non-affiliates, including transfer agents, custodians or other service
companies. Access to your nonpublic personal information is restricted to
employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to
you. To maintain the security of your nonpublic personal information, physical,
electronic, and procedural safeguards are in place that comply with federal

or broker's privacy policies for a statement of the treatment of your personal
information.

                        CHANGE IN INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") had been selected as the independent
accountants of the Fund for its fiscal year ending September 30, 2004. On May 7,
2004, PwC resigned as the Fund's independent accountants for its fiscal year
ending September 30, 2004 effective upon the completion of services related to
the Fund's semi-annual financial statements. The reports provided by PwC for the
fiscal years ending September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003 were unqualified
and contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were the reports
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle. Further, in
connection with its audits for the two previous fiscal years and through May 31,
2004, there have been no disagreements between PwC and the Fund on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to their satisfaction,
would have caused PwC to reference the subject matter of the disagreements in
its report on the financial statements for such years. The Fund is currently
seeking to retain new independent auditors for its fiscal year ending September
30, 2004.

(1) The Fund adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
Investment Companies and began accreting discounts and amortizing premiums on
all debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended September 30,
2002 was a decrease in net investment loss per share of $.006, an increase in
net realized and unrealized loss on investments per share of $.006, and a
decrease in the ratio of net investment loss to average net assets from (1.28%)
to (1.25%). Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to October 1, 2001

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 March 31, 2004
                                   (UNAUDITED)

(1) ORGANIZATION

       H&Q Life Sciences Investors (the Fund) is a Massachusetts business trust
    registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified
    closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is
    long-term capital appreciation through investment in securities of companies
    in the healthcare industries. The Fund invests primarily in securities of
    public and private companies that are believed to have significant potential
    for above-average growth. The Fund was organized on February 20, 1992 and
    commenced operations on May 8, 1992.

       The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of certain
    estimates by management in determining the entity's assets, liabilities,
    revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
    following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
    followed by the Fund, which are in conformity with those generally accepted
    in the United States of America.

    INVESTMENT SECURITIES

       Investments traded on national securities exchanges or in the
    over-the-counter market that are National Market System securities are
    valued at the last sale price or, lacking any sales, at the mean between the
    last bid and asked prices. Other over-the-counter securities are valued at
    the most recent bid prices as obtained from one or more dealers that make
    markets in the securities. As indicated in Note 4, investments for which
    market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
    determined in good faith by the Trustees of the Fund. Temporary cash
    investments with maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

       Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Gains and
    losses from sales of investments are recorded using the "identified cost"
    method. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividend income is
    recorded on the ex-dividend date.

    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

       In connection with transactions in repurchase agreements, the Fund's
    custodian takes possession of the underlying collateral securities, the
    market value of which is at least equal to the principal, including accrued
    interest, of the repurchase transaction at all times. In the event of
    default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization
    and/or retention of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

       It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
    to its shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and its net
    realized capital gains, if any. Therefore, no Federal income or excise tax
    provision is required.

    DISTRIBUTIONS

       The Fund records all distributions to shareholders from net investment
    income, if any, and realized gains on the ex-dividend date. Such
    distributions are determined in conformity with income tax regulations. Due
    to permanent book/tax differences in accounting for certain transactions,
    certain distributions may be treated as distributions from capital as
    opposed to distributions of net investment income or realized capital gains.

    DISTRIBUTION POLICY

       The current distribution policy is to declare distributions in stock.
    Stock distributions will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the
    Fund unless otherwise instructed by the

                                       15
<Page>

    shareholder. Pursuant to an SEC exemptive order, the Fund has implemented a
    fixed distribution policy that permits the Fund to make quarterly
    distributions at a rate of 2% of the Fund's net assets to shareholders of
    record. The Fund intends to use net realized capital gains when making
    quarterly distributions. This could result in a return of capital to
    shareholders if the amount of the distribution exceeds the Fund's net
    investment income and realized capital gains. It is anticipated that net
    realized capital gains in excess of the total distributed under this policy
    would be included in the December distribution.

    STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

       The cash amount shown in the Statement of Cash Flows is the amount
    included in the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities and represents
    cash on hand at its custodian and does not include temporary cash
    investments at March 31, 2004.

    INDEMNIFICATIONS

       Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and Trustees may
    be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the
    performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course
    of business, the Fund enters into agreements with service providers that may
    contain indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
    agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
    against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience,
    the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

(2) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

       The aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment
    securities (other than temporary cash investments) for the six months ended
    March 31, 2004 totaled $24,082,147 and $33,352,421, respectively.

       At March 31, 2004, the total cost of securities for Federal income tax
    purposes was $171,935,386. The net unrealized gain on securities held by the
    Fund was $35,385,524, including gross unrealized gain of $64,632,906 and
    gross unrealized loss of $29,247,382.

(3) INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

       The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement (the Advisory
    Agreement) with Hambrecht & Quist Capital Management LLC (the Adviser).
    Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a
    monthly fee at the rate when annualized of (i) 2.5% of the average net
    assets for the month of its venture capital and other restricted securities
    up to 25% of net assets and (ii) for the month, for all other assets, 1.0%
    of the average net assets up to $250 million, 0.9% of the average net assets
    for the next $250 million, 0.8% of the average net assets for the next $500
    million and 0.7% of the average net assets thereafter. The aggregate fee may
    not exceed a rate when annualized of 1.375%. Certain officers and Trustees
    of the Fund are also officers of the Adviser.

       Trustees who are not affiliates of the Adviser receive an annual fee of
    $20,000 plus $500 for each Committee on which they serve and $1,000 for each
    meeting attended.

(4) VENTURE CAPITAL AND OTHER RESTRICTED SECURITIES

       The Fund may invest in venture capital and other restricted securities if
    these securities would currently comprise 40% or less of net assets. The
    value of these securities represents 19% of the Fund's net assets at March
    31, 2004.

       The value of the venture capital and other restricted securities is
    determined in good faith by the Trustees. However, because of the inherent
    uncertainty of valuations, these estimated

                                       16
<Page>

    values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used
    had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be
    material.

       During the six-month period ended March 31, 2004, certain restricted
    securities were exchanged for cash in connection with a corporate action, a
    portion of which has been retained by the issuer in an escrow account
    pending resolution of certain contingencies and whose estimated value of
    $388,000 at March 31, 2004 has also been determined by the Trustees. At
    March 31, 2004, the Fund has a proportionate interest in a 5% interest
    bearing promissory note due October 31, 2004 from the sale of restricted
    securities, with a par value o f $80,800 and an estimated value of $80,000
    as determined by the Trustees. The value of the escrow account and note are
    included in the Receivable for Investments Sold in the Statement of Assets
    and Liabilities.

    The following table details the acquisition date, cost, carrying value per
    unit, and value of the Fund's venture capital and other restricted
    securities at March 31, 2004, as determined by the Trustees of the Fund.
