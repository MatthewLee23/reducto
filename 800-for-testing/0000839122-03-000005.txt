LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Dreyfus Municipal Income, Inc. covers the 12-month period
from  October  1, 2002, through September 30, 2003. Inside, you'll find valuable
information  about  how  the  fund  was  managed  during  the  reporting period,
including a discussion with the fund's portfolio manager, Joseph Darcy.

After a prolonged period of sluggish growth, the U.S. economy has shown signs of
sustainable improvement. However, investor uncertainty regarding the strength of
the  recovery  has produced heightened volatility in the tax-exempt fixed-income
market. After most areas of the municipal bond market experienced sharp declines
during   the   summer,   prices   generally   bounced   back   in   September.

Despite  recent reductions in federal tax rates, we believe that municipal bonds
may  become  more  attractive  to certain investors if states and municipalities
continue to raise taxes to balance their budgets. As always, we encourage you to
talk  with your financial advisor about ways to enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt
municipal bonds as market conditions evolve.

Thank you for your continued confidence and support.

Sincerely,


Stephen E. Canter

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

The Dreyfus Corporation

October 15, 2003




DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

Joseph Darcy, Portfolio Manager

How did Dreyfus Municipal Income, Inc. perform during the period?

For  the  12-month  period  ended  September 30, 2003, the fund achieved a total
return  of 4.50%.(1) Over the same period, the fund provided income dividends of
$0.6800 per share, which is equal to a distribution rate of 7.02%.(2)

The  fund's performance was primarily influenced by falling interest rates early
in  the reporting period and heightened volatility in the municipal bond market,
particularly  in  July,  as  the outlook for the U.S. economy improved. The fund
successfully  avoided  the  full brunt of the market's volatility by emphasizing
high-quality, income-oriented securities.

What is the fund's investment approach?

The  fund seeks to maximize current income exempt from federal income tax to the
extent  consistent with the preservation of capital from a portfolio that, under
normal market conditions, invests at least 80% of the value of its net assets in
municipal  obligations.  Under  normal  market  conditions,  the fund invests in
municipal obligations which, at the time of purchase, are rated investment-grade
or  the  unrated  equivalent  as determined by Dreyfus in the case of bonds, and
rated  in  the  two  highest  rating  categories  or  the  unrated equivalent as
determined by Dreyfus in the case of short-term obligations having, or deemed to
have,    maturities    of    less    than    one    year.

We  generally  employ  two primary strategies. First, we attempt to add value by
evaluating  interest-rate  trends  and  supply-and-demand factors. Based on that
assessment,  we  look  for  bonds  that  we believe can potentially provide high
current  levels  of income. We look at such criteria as the bond's yield, price,
age, the creditworthiness of its issuer and any provisions for early redemption

                                                             The Fund


DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED)

Second,  we  actively  manage  the  fund' s  average  duration  --  a measure of
sensitivity  to  changes  in  interest  rates  --  in  anticipation of temporary
supply-and-demand  changes. For example, if we expect the supply of newly issued
bonds to increase temporarily, we may reduce the fund's average duration to make
cash  available  for  the  purchase  of  what  we  believe  can  potentially  be
higher-yielding  securities. Conversely, if we expect demand for municipal bonds
to  surge  at  a  time  when  we anticipate little issuance, we may increase the
fund' s  average duration to maintain then-current yields for as long as we deem
appropriate.

Over  time,  many  of  the fund's relatively higher-yielding bonds mature or are
redeemed  by  their  issuers,  and  we  generally  attempt  to replace them with
securities  at  then-prevailing yields, which may be lower than the rates of the
securities  which  mature  or  are  redeemed.  We  also  may look to upgrade the
portfolio  investments,  when we deem appropriate, with newly issued bonds that,
in  our  opinion, have better structural or income characteristics than existing
holdings.

What other factors influenced the fund's performance?

Economic  weakness  during  much of the reporting period proved to be beneficial
for  municipal bonds as the Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") reduced short-term
interest  rates in November 2002 and June 2003 to 1%, a 45-year low. Longer-term
bond yields declined in this environment, producing attractive levels of capital
appreciation.  However,  signs  of  greater  economic  strength in July 2003 led
investors  to believe that the Fed's most recent rate cut may have been the last
of the current cycle, and many sold bonds. As a result, bond prices fell sharply
in July and early August, erasing most of the reporting period's previous gains,
before   rising   again   more   moderately   in  late  August  and  September.

The weak economy also adversely affected the fiscal condition of many states and
municipalities.  Because  tax revenues failed to meet budgeted projections, many
states  faced  widening  deficits  and  credit-rating  downgrades. To fund their
budget  shortfalls,  many  municipalities  issued  a  higher volume of municipal
bonds.    Although    a    larger    supply

of  municipal bonds historically has tended to drive yields higher, the increase
in  supply  during  the  reporting  period  generally was met by robust investor
demand, and bond yields generally remained low.

Finally,  the  reporting  period' s  low  interest  rates  benefited  the fund's
leveraged  investment  strategy. Because the fund was able to lock in prevailing
low  interest  rates  for  a longer period to buy additional securities, we were
able to raise its dividend distribution rate in January 2003.

What is the fund's current strategy?

When   making   new  purchases,  we  generally  have  emphasized  higher-quality
securities,  including  insured  securities  and bonds from highly rated issuers
that  we believe have strong liquidity characteristics.(3) This focus helped the
fund  avoid  weakness  among  lower-rated bonds as fiscal pressures intensified

At  the same time, the fund's long average duration and its core holdings helped
it  avoid the full brunt of the market's volatility in July. More recently, as a
result  of  sales of some lower-quality securities, we have increased the fund's
cash  holdings.  We  will  look  to  deploy  those  assets  to securities as new
opportunities    arise.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1--Significant Accounting Policies:

Dreyfus  Municipal  Income, Inc. (the "fund") is registered under the Investment
Company  Act  of  1940,  as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified closed-end
management  investment  company.  The fund's investment objective is to maximize
current  income exempt from federal income tax to the extent consistent with the
preservation  of  capital. The Dreyfus Corporation (the "Manager") serves as the
fund' s  investment  adviser. The Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon
Bank,  N.A.  (" Mellon"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial
Corporation. The fund's Common Stock trades on the American Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol DMF.

The  fund  has outstanding 2,000 shares of Series A and 2,000 shares of Series B
Auction  Preferred  Stock  ("APS"), with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
share   (plus   an  amount  equal  to  accumulated  but  unpaid  dividends  upon
liquidation) . APS  dividend rates are determined pursuant to periodic auctions.
Deutsche  Bank  Trust Company America, as Auction Agent, receives a fee from the
fund  for  its  services  in  connection  with  such  auctions.  The  fund  also
compensates  broker-dealers  generally at an annual rate of .25% of the purchase
price  of  the  shares  of  APS  placed  by  the  broker-dealer  in  an auction

The  fund  is  subject  to  certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply  with  these  restrictions  could  preclude  the  fund from declaring any
distributions  to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The  holders  of the APS, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect at
least  two  directors.  The  holders of the APS will vote as a separate class on
certain  other  matters,  as required by law. The fund has designated Whitney I.
Gerard  and  George  L. Perry to represent holders of APS on the fund's Board of
Directors.

The  fund' s  financial  statements  are  prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which may require the use of
management  estimates  and  assumptions.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

                                                             The Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(A)  PORTFOLIO  VALUATION:  Investments  in municipal debt securities (excluding
options  and  financial  futures  on municipal and U.S. Treasury securities) are
valued  daily  by an independent pricing service (the "Service") approved by the
Board  of  Directors.  Investments  for  which  quoted  bid  prices  are readily
available  and  are representative of the bid side of the market in the judgment
of the Service are valued at the mean between the quoted bid prices (as obtained
by  the Service from dealers in such securities) and asked prices (as calculated
by  the  Service  based  upon its evaluation of the market for such securities).
Other  investments (which constitute a majority of the portfolio securities) are
carried  at  fair  value  as  determined  by the Service, based on methods which
include consideration of: yields or prices of municipal securities of comparable
quality,  coupon,  maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; and
general  market  conditions. Options and financial futures on municipal and U.S.
Treasury  securities  are  valued  at  the  last  sales  price on the securities
exchange  on  which  such  securities  are primarily traded or at the last sales
price   on   the   national   securities   market   on   each   business   day.

(B)  SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
recorded  on  a  trade  date  basis.  Realized  gain  and  loss  from securities
transactions  are  recorded  on  the  identified  cost  basis.  Interest income,
adjusted  for  amortization  of premiums and discounts on investments, is earned
from  settlement  date and recognized on the accrual basis. Securities purchased
or  sold  on  a  when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be settled a month or
more after the trade date.

(C)  DIVIDENDS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS  OF  COMMON  STOCK  (" COMMON SHAREHOLDER(S)"):
Dividends  are  recorded  on  the  ex-dividend  date.  Dividends from investment
income-net  are  declared  and paid monthly. Dividends from net realized capital
gain,  if  any,  are  normally declared and paid annually, but the fund may make
distributions  on  a  more  frequent  basis  to  comply  with  the  distribution
requirements  of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). To
the  extent  that  net  realized  capital  gain  can  be  offset by capital loss
carryovers,  it  is  the  policy of the fund not to distribute such gain. Income

and  capital  gain  distributions  are  determined in accordance with income tax
regulations,  which  may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

For  Common  Shareholders who elect to receive their distributions in additional
shares  of  the  fund, in lieu of cash, such distributions will be reinvested at
the  lower  of  the market price or net asset value per share (but not less than
95% of the market price) as defined in the dividend reinvestment plan.

On  September 30, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend  of $.06
per  share  from  investment  income-net,  payable on October 29, 2003 to Common
Shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 15, 2003.

(D)  DIVIDENDS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS  OF APS: For APS, dividends are currently reset
every  7  days  for  Series  A. The dividend rate for Series B will be in effect
until February 17, 2005. The dividend rates in effect at September 30, 2003 were
as follows: Series A .90% and Series B 1.58%.

(E) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the policy of the fund to continue to qualify as
a  regulated  investment  company, which can distribute tax exempt dividends, by
complying  with the applicable provisions of the Code, and to make distributions
of  income  and  net  realized  capital  gain  sufficient  to  relieve  it  from
substantially all federal income and excise taxes.

At  September  30,  2003,  the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis
were as follows: undistributed tax exempt income $2,912,062, accumulated capital
losses $8,542,403 and unrealized appreciation $14,351,669. In addition, the fund
had  $3,394,320  of  capital  losses  realized after October 31, 2002, which are
deferred for tax purposes to the first day of the following fiscal year.

The  accumulated  capital  loss  is  available  to be applied against future net
securities  profits,  if  any, realized subsequent to September 30, 2003. If not
applied,  $4,999,899  of  the  carryover  expires  in  fiscal  2004,
                                                                    The Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

$1,148,413  expires  in fiscal 2008, $619,742 expires in fiscal 2009, $1,413,550
expires    in   fiscal   2010   and   $360,799   expires   in   fiscal   2011.

The  tax  character  of  distributions  paid  to  shareholders during the fiscal
periods  ended  September  30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, were as follows: tax
exempt income $15,262,192 and $13,139,028, respectively.

During the period ended September 30, 2003, as a result of permanent book to tax
differences,  the fund decreased accumulated undistributed investment income-net
by  $9,713 and increased paid-in capital by the same amount. Net assets were not
affected by this reclassification

NOTE 2--Bank Line of Credit:

The  fund  participates  with  other  Dreyfus-managed  funds  in  a $100 million
unsecured  line  of  credit  primarily to be utilized for temporary or emergency
purposes.  Interest  is  charged to the fund based on prevailing market rates in
effect  at  the  time of borrowings. During the period ended September 30, 2003,
the    fund    did    not    borrow    under    the    line    of    credit.

NOTE 3--Management Fee and Other Transactions With Affiliates:

(A)  Pursuant  to  a  management  agreement  ("Agreement") with the Manager, the
management  fee  is computed at the annual rate of .70 of 1% of the value of the
fund' s  average daily net assets, inclusive of the oustanding auction preferred
stock, and is payable monthly. The Agreement provides that if in any full fiscal
year  the  aggregate  expenses  of  the  fund,  exclusive  of taxes, interest on
borrowings,  brokerage  fees  and  extraordinary  expenses,  exceed  the expense
limitation  of  any state having jurisdiction over the fund, the fund may deduct
from payments to be made to the Manager, or the Manager will bear, the amount of
such  excess  to  the  extent  required  by  state  law. During the period ended
September  30,  2003,  there  was  no  expense  reimbursement  pursuant  to  the
Agreement.

(B)  The fund compensates Mellon under a transfer agency agreement for providing
personnel    and    facilities    to    perform    transfer    agency

services  for the fund. During the period ended September 30, 2003, the fund was
charged $50,914 pursuant to the transfer agency agreement.

The  fund  compensates  Mellon under a custody agreement for providing custodial
services  for the fund. During the period ended September 30, 2003, the fund was
charged $22,620 pursuant to the custody agreement.

(C)  Each  Board  member also serves as a Board member of other funds within the
Dreyfus  complex  (collectively,  the  "Fund Group"). Through December 31, 2002,
each  Board  member  who  is  not  an  "affiliated person" as defined in the Act
received  an  annual  fee  of  $45,000,  an  attendance  fee  of $5,000 for each
in-person  meeting  and  $500 for telephone meetings. Effective January 1, 2003,
the  number  of  funds  in the Fund Group, comprising the fund increased and the
annual  fee  was  increased to $60,000 while the attendance fee was increased to
$7,500  for  each  in-person  meeting.  As  a  result  of  this  change  in  the
compensation arrangement aggregate fees paid to each Board member for the period
ended  September  30,  2003 were $1,250 as compared to $1,910 (normally the fees
would  have  been  $1,410  except for a fund specific telephone meeting) for the
period  ended  September  30,  2002.  The  Chairman  of  the  Board  receives an
additional  25%  of  such  compensation.  Subject to the fund's Emeritus Program
Guidelines,  Emeritus  Board members, if any, receive 50% of the annual retainer
fee  and  per  meeting  fee  paid at the time the Board member achieves emeritus
status. These fees are allocated among the funds in the Fund Group in proportion
to each fund's relative net assets.

NOTE 4--Securities Transactions:

The  aggregate amount of purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term  securities,  during the period ended September 30, 2003, amounted to
$28,397,870 and $27,988,003, respectively.

At  September  30, 2003, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes
was  $275,023,559;  accordingly,  accumulated  net  unrealized  appreciation  on
investments   was   $14,351,669,  consisting  of  $17,790,570  gross  unrealized
appreciation and $3,438,901 gross unrealized depreciation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors Dreyfus Municipal Income, Inc.

We  have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Dreyfus
Municipal  Income, Inc., including the statement of investments, as of September
30,  2003,  and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the
statement  of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended,  and  financial highlights for each of the years indicated therein. These
financial  statements  and  financial  highlights  are the responsibility of the
Fund' s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial statements and
financial  highlights  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes
examining,  on  a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements  and  financial  highlights.  Our procedures included
verification  by examination of securities held by the custodian as of September
30,   2003  and  confirmation  of  securities  not  held  by  the  custodian  by
correspondence  with  others.  An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the financial position of
Dreyfus  Municipal  Income,  Inc.  at  September  30,  2003,  the results of its

the indicated years, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Under  the  fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), a Common Shareholder
who  has  fund  shares  registered  in  his  name  will  have  all dividends and
distributions  reinvested  automatically by Mellon, as Plan agent (the "Agent"),
in  additional shares of the fund at the lower of prevailing market price or net
asset  value  (but  not  less than 95% of market value at the time of valuation)
unless  such  Common  Shareholder  elects  to receive cash as provided below. If
market  price  is  equal to or exceeds net asset value, shares will be issued at
net  asset  value. If net asset value exceeds market price or if a cash dividend
only  is  declared, the Agent, as agent for the Plan participants, will buy fund
shares  in the open market. A Plan participant is not relieved of any income tax
that may be payable on such dividends or distributions.

A Common Shareholder who owns fund shares registered in nominee name through his
broker/dealer  (i.e., in "street name") may not participate in the Plan, but may
elect  to  have cash dividends and distributions reinvested by his broker/dealer
in   additional  shares  of  the  fund  if  such  service  is  provided  by  the
broker/dealer;  otherwise  such dividends and distributions will be treated like
any other cash dividend or distribution.

A  Common  Shareholder  who  has fund shares registered in his name may elect to
withdraw  from the Plan at any time for a $5.00 fee and thereby elect to receive
cash  in  lieu  of  shares of the fund. Changes in elections must be in writing,
sent   to   Mellon  Bank,  c/o  ChaseMellon  Shareholder  Services,  Shareholder
Investment  Plan,  P.O.  Box  3338,  South  Hackensack, New Jersey 07606, should
include the shareholder's name and address as they appear on the Agent's records
and  will be effective only if received more than ten business days prior to the
record date for any distribution.

The  Agent  maintains  all Common Shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written  confirmations of all transactions in the account. Shares in the account
of  each  Plan participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificated form in
the  name  of  the  participant,  and each such participant's proxy will include
those shares purchased pursuant to the Plan.

                                                             The Fund

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (CONTINUED)

The  fund  pays the Agent's fee for reinvestment of dividends and distributions.
Plan  participants  pay  a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment
of    dividends    or    distributions.

The  fund  reserves  the  right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend  or  distribution  paid subsequent to notice of the change sent to Plan
participants  at  least  90  days  before  the  record date for such dividend or
distribution.  The  Plan  also  may  be amended or terminated by the Agent on at
least 90 days' written notice to Plan participants.

MANAGED DIVIDEND POLICY

The  fund' s  dividend  policy  is  to  distribute  substantially all of its net
investment  income  to  its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more consistent yield to the current trading price of shares
of  Common Stock of the fund, the fund may at times pay out less than the entire
amount  of net investment income earned in any particular month and may at times
in  any  month  pay out such accumulated but undistributed income in addition to
net  investment  income earned in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by
the  fund  for  any  particular month may be more or less than the amount of net
investment  income  earned  by  the  fund  during such month. The fund's current
accumulated but undistributed net investment income, if any, is disclosed in the
Statement  of  Assets  and  Liabilities,  which  comprises part of the Financial
Information included in this report.

BENEFITS AND RISKS OF LEVERAGING

The  fund  utilizes leverage to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value of
its  Common  Stock.  These  objects  cannot  be  achieved  in  all interest rate
environments. To leverage, the fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends
at  prevailing  short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal  bonds.  The  interest  earned  on these investments is paid to Common
Shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings
is    reflected    in    the    per

share  net  asset  value  of the fund's Common Stock. In order to benefit Common
Shareholders,  the  yield  curve  must be positively sloped: that is, short-term
interest  rates must be lower than long-term interest rates. At the same time, a
period  of  generally declining interest rates will benefit Common Shareholders.
If  either of these conditions change, then the risk of leveraging will begin to
outweigh the benefits.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

During the period ended September 30, 2003, shareholders approved changes in the
fund' s  fundamental  investment  policies  to permit the fund to engage in swap
transactions  and to invest in other investment companies. Otherwise, during the
period  ended  September  30,  2003,  there were: (i) no material changes in the
fund' s  investment objective or policies, (ii) no changes in the fund's charter
or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change of control of the fund, (iii) no
material changes in the principal risk factors associated with investment in the
fund,  and (iv) no change in the person primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the fund's portfolio.

                                                             The Fund

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION (Unaudited)

In accordance with federal tax law, the fund hereby designates all the dividends
paid  from investment income-net during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003
as  "exempt-interest dividends" (not generally subject to regular federal income
tax)   .

As  required by federal tax law rules, shareholders will receive notification of
their portion of the fund's taxable ordinary dividends (if any) and capital gain
distributions  (if  any)  paid for the 2003 calendar year on Form 1099-DIV which
will be mailed by January 31, 2004.

                         THE DREYFUS FAMILY OF FUNDS
                    CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                        AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



1.    Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

      This code of ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
the complex (each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or
Controller, or other persons performing similar functions, each of whom is
listed on Exhibit A (the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
      apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
      relationships;

o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
      documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities and
      Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications made by
      the Fund;

o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
      person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

2.    Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts
of Interest


      OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
Fund.  For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his position with the Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act").  For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund.  The compliance programs and procedures of
the Fund and the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser") are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions.  The Code
does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and
procedures, and the circumstances they cover fall outside of the parameters
of the Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers
are also officers or employees.  As a result, the Code recognizes that the
Covered Officers, in the ordinary course of their duties (whether formally
for the Fund or for the Adviser, or for both), will be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Adviser and the Fund.  The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund and, if
addressed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and
the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.
In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board that the Covered Officers
also may be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies
covered by this or other codes of ethics.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act.  Covered Officers should keep in mind
that the Code cannot enumerate every possible scenario.  The overarching
principle of the Code is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer
should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Fund.

      Each Covered Officer must:

o     not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund whereby
      the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

o     not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
      of the Fund; and

o     not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
      potential violations that are made in good faith.

3.    Disclosure and Compliance

o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
      requirements generally applicable to the Fund within his area of
      responsibility;

o     each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
      misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or outside
      the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members and auditors, and to
      governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations; and

o     each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
      responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and
      the Adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
      understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
      with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
      the Fund; and

o     it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
      with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
      regulations.

4.    Reporting and Accountability

      Each Covered Officer must:

o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
      read, and understands the Code;

o     annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
      requirements of the Code; and

o     notify the Adviser's General Counsel (the "General Counsel") promptly if
      he knows of any violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a
      violation of the Code.

      The General Counsel is responsible for applying the Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any particular situation.  However, waivers sought by
any Covered Officer will be considered by the Fund's Board.

      The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
the Code:

o     the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
      potential violations reported to him;

o     if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
      violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any
      further action;

o     any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
      reported to the Board;

o     if the Board concurs that a violation has occurred, it will consider
      appropriate action, which may include: review of, and appropriate
      modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
      appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board; or dismissal of the
      Covered Officer;

o     the Board will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

o     any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required, will be
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

5.    Other Policies and Procedures

      The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.  The Fund's,
its principal underwriter's and the Adviser's codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and the Adviser's additional policies
and procedures, including its Code of Conduct, are separate requirements
applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

6.    Amendments

      The Code may not be amended except in written form which is
specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Fund's Board,
including a majority of independent Board members.

7.    Confidentiality

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly.  Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds and their
counsel, the appropriate Boards (or Committees) and their counsel and the
Adviser.

8.    Internal Use

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
