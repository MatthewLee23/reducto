                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Dividend  &  Income  Trust  (the  "Fund")  is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on November 18, 2003 and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940,  as amended (the "1940 Act").  Investment  operations  commenced on
November 28, 2003.

      The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return
on its assets with an emphasis on dividends and income. The Fund will attempt to
achieve its investment  objective by investing,  under normal market conditions,
at least 80% of its assets in  dividend  paying  securities  (such as common and
preferred stock) or other income producing securities (such as fixed income debt
securities and securities that are convertible into equity securities).

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good  faith to reflect  its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
amount  does not  reflect  the  securities'  fair  value,  in which  case  these
securities  will be fair valued as  determined  by the Board.  Debt  instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  fair  valued  as  determined  by  the  Board.   Fair   valuation
methodologies  and procedures may include,  but are not limited to: analysis and
review of available  financial and non-financial  information about the company;
comparisons  to the  valuation  and changes in valuation of similar  securities,
including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value
ADR  securities at the close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other
information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At June 30,
2006, the Fund had investments of $330,000,000 in repurchase agreements.

      OPTIONS.  The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Fund  receives  a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial  instrument  underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the  underlying  financial  instrument  decreases  between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain,  to the  extent of the  premium,  if the price of the  financial
instrument increases between those dates.

      As a purchaser  of put  options,  the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If the price of the  underlying
security declines,  the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise.  If the
price of the  underlying  security  increases or stays the same,  the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at  expiration  date,  but only to the extent of the
premium paid.

      In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred to as
"in-the-money,"  "at-the-money," and "out-of-the-money,"  respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) covered  at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects
that the  price  of the  underlying  security  will  remain  stable  or  advance
moderately during the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money  call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the  appreciation in the price of the underlying  security above
the exercise price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to
profit from any increase in the market value of the  underlying  security  above
the  exercise  price  of  the  option.   Out-of-the-money,   at-the-money,   and
in-the-money  put options  (the  reverse of call  options as to the  relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market  environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions.

      SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund  may  enter  into  interest  rate  swap or cap
transactions.  The use of swaps and caps is a highly  specialized  activity that
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  transactions.  Swap  agreements  may  involve,  to  varying
degrees,  elements  of market and  counterparty  risk,  and  exposure to loss in
excess  of  the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statement  of  Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest rate swap, the Fund would agree to pay to the other
party  to  the  interest  rate  swap  (which  is  known  as  the   counterparty)
periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund  periodically  a  variable  rate  payment  that is  intended  to
approximate  the Fund's  variable rate payment  obligation on Series B Preferred
Stock. In an


                                       13
<PAGE>

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty  and, to the
extent that a specified variable rate index exceeds a predetermined  fixed rate,
would receive from that  counterparty  payments of the  difference  based on the
notional amount of such cap.  Interest rate swap and cap transactions  introduce
additional  risk because the Fund would remain  obligated to pay preferred stock
dividends  when due in accordance  with the Articles  Supplementary  even if the
counterparty  defaulted.  If there is a default  by the  counterparty  to a swap
contract,  the Fund will be  limited to  contractual  remedies  pursuant  to the
agreements  related  to the  transaction.  There is no  assurance  that the swap
contract  counterparties  will be able to meet their  obligations  pursuant to a
swap  contract  or that,  in the  event of  default,  the Fund will  succeed  in
pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund thus  assumes the risk that it may be
delayed in or prevented  from  obtaining  payments owed to it pursuant to a swap
contract.  The  creditworthiness of the swap contract  counterparties is closely
monitored  in order to minimize  this risk.  Depending  on the general  state of
short-term interest rates and the returns on the Fund's portfolio  securities at
that point in time, such a default could negatively affect the Fund's ability to
make dividend payments for Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, at the time an
interest rate swap or cap transaction  reaches its scheduled  termination  date,
there  is a risk  that  the  Fund  will  not be able  to  obtain  a  replacement
transaction or that the terms of the replacement  will not be as favorable as on
the expiring transaction. If this occurs, it could have a negative impact on the
Fund's ability to make dividend payments on Series B Preferred Stock.

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

      The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with Citibank
N.A.  Under the agreement the Fund receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2006 are as follows:

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Fund may  engage  in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase.  Upon entering into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/depreciation   on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The  Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid  secondary  market.  At June 30, 2006, there were no open
futures contracts.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      SECURITIES  SOLD SHORT.  The Fund may enter into short sale  transactions.
Short selling involves  selling  securities that may or may not be owned and, at
times,  borrowing the same  securities  for delivery to the  purchaser,  with an
obligation  to replace such borrowed  securities  at a later date.  The proceeds
received  from short sales are recorded as  liabilities  and the Fund records an
unrealized  gain or loss to the extent of the  difference  between the  proceeds
received  and the value of an open short  position on the day of  determination.
The Fund records a realized gain or loss when the short  position is closed out.
By entering into a short sale,  the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable
change in the price of the  security  sold short.  Dividends  on short sales are
recorded as an expense by the Fund on the ex-dividend  date and interest expense
is  recorded on the accrual  basis.  Securities  sold short at June 30, 2006 are
reported within the Schedule of Investments.

      FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At June 30, 2006, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts.

      FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated  at the exchange  rate  prevailing  on the  respective  dates of such
transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from  changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been included
in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign  currency
translations.  Net realized  foreign  currency  gains and losses  resulting from
changes in exchange  rates include  foreign  currency  gains and losses  between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

      FOREIGN TAXES.  The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income,  gains
on investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      RESTRICTED  AND  ILLIQUID  SECURITIES.  The  Fund  is  not  subject  to an
independent  limitation on the amount it may invest in securities  for which the
markets are illiquid.  Illiquid securities include securities the disposition of
which is subject to substantial legal or contractual  restrictions.  The sale of
illiquid  securities  often  requires more time and results in higher  brokerage
charges or dealer  discounts  and other  selling  expenses than does the sale of
securities  eligible  for trading on  national  securities  exchanges  or in the
over-the-counter  markets.  Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than
similar  securities that are not subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities
freely  saleable among  qualified  institutional  investors  under special rules
adopted by the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") may be treated as
liquid  if they  satisfy  liquidity  standards  established  by the  Board.  The
continued  liquidity  of  such  securities  is not as  well  assured  as that of
publicly  traded  securities,  and  accordingly  the Board  will  monitor  their
liquidity.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

      CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS.  When cash  balances are  maintained in the custody
account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to offset custodian fees. The
gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are included in custodian fees
in the Statement of Operations with the  corresponding  expense offset,  if any,
shown as "custodian fee credits".

      DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with Federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing  characterizations  of distributions  made by the Fund.  Distributions
from net  investment  income  include  net  realized  gains on foreign  currency
transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either  temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these  differences are permanent,  adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value ("NAV") of the Fund. For
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, reclassifications were made to decrease
accumulated  net  investment  income by $1,001,343  and to decrease  accumulated
distributions  in excess of net realized gain on  investments,  swap  contracts,
options, and foreign currency transactions by $1,001,343.

      Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  5.875% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  Series B Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series C
Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock, 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred
Stock,  and  Series E  Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Cumulative
Preferred  Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described
in Note 5.

      PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's  average
weekly  net  assets  including  liquidation  value of the  preferred  stock.  In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment  program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the  management fee on the  incremental  assets  attributable  to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

      The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months ended
June 30, 2006, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares  exceeded
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of all outstanding Preferred
Stock. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

discount of 7.5% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may  determine
from time to time) from the NAV of the shares.  During the six months ended June
30, 2006, the Fund repurchased 185,400 shares of beneficial interest in the open
market at a cost of $3,396,622 and an average discount of  approximately  14.06%

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      The Fund's Declaration of Trust, as amended, authorizes the issuance of an
unlimited number of shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the common  shares and  results in the
financial leveraging of the common shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative.  The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the  Statements of  Preferences to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect  to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Fund  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not  correct  such  failure,  the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the 5.875% Series A, Series B Auction Market, Series
C Auction Market, 6.00% Series D, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock  at  redemption  prices  of  $25,  $25,000,  $25,000,  $25,  and  $25,000,
respectively,  per share  plus an amount  equal to the  accumulated  and  unpaid
dividends  whether  or not  declared  on such  shares  in  order  to meet  these
requirements.  Additionally,  failure  to  meet  the  foregoing  asset  coverage
requirements  could  restrict  the  Fund's  ability to pay  dividends  to common
shareholders  and could lead to sales of  portfolio  securities  at  inopportune
times.  The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner  unrelated
to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which  could  have  either a  beneficial  or
detrimental  impact  on net  investment  income  and gains  available  to common
shareholders.

      On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $77,280,971  (after
underwriting discounts of $2,520,000 and offering expenses of $199,029) from the
public  offering of 3,200,000  shares of 5.875%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. Commencing October 12, 2009 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30,  2006,  the
Fund did not  repurchase  any  shares of 5.875%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  At June 30,  2006,  3,200,000  shares  of  5.875%  Series  A  Cumulative
Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $91,389.

      On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $217,488,958 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,200,000 and offering expenses of $311,042) from the
public offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares of Series C Auction
Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  respectively.  The dividend rate, as set by
the auction  process,  which is generally held every 7 days, is expected to vary
with short-term  interest  rates.  The dividend rates of Series B Auction Market
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock ranged from 4.14% to 5.26% for the six months ended
June 30,  2006.  The  dividend  rates  of  Series C  Auction  Market  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock  ranged  from 4.10% to 5.36% for the six months  ended June 30,
2006.  Existing  shareholders  may  submit an order to hold,  bid,  or sell such
shares on each auction date. Series B and C Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred
Stock  shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary market.  The Fund, at
its option,  may redeem the Series B and C Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock in whole or in part at the  redemption  price at any time.  During the six
months ended June 30, 2006, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series B and C
Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. At June 30, 2006,  4,000 and 4,800
shares of the  Series B and C Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were
outstanding  with an  annualized  dividend rate of 5.26% and 5.36% per share and
accrued dividends amounted to $73,056 and $53,600, respectively.

      On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $62,727,500  (after
underwriting   discounts  of  $2,047,500  and  estimated  offering  expenses  of
$225,000)  from the  public  offering  of  2,600,000  shares  of 6.00%  Series D
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  Commencing  November 3, 2010 and thereafter,  the
Fund, at its option, may redeem the 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock in
whole or in part at the  redemption  price at any time.  During  the six  months
ended June 30, 2006,  the Fund did not  repurchase  any shares of 6.00% Series D
Cumulative Preferred Stock. At June 30, 2006, 2,600,000 shares of 6.00% Series D
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$75,833.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $133,400,000 (after
underwriting   discounts  of  $1,350,000  and  estimated  offering  expenses  of
$250,000)  from the public  offering  of 5,400  shares of Series E Auction  Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  The dividend rate, as set by the auction process,
which is  generally  held  every 7 days,  is  expected  to vary with  short-term
interest rates. The dividend rates of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock  ranged  from  4.22% to 5.20%  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2006.
Existing  shareholders  may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on
each auction date.  Series E Auction Rate Preferred Stock  shareholders may also
trade shares in the secondary  market.  The Fund, at its option,  may redeem the
Series E  Auction  Rate  Preferred  Stock in whole or in part at the  redemption
price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30, 2006,  the Fund did not
redeem any shares of Series E Auction Rate  Preferred  Stock.  At June 30, 2006,
5,400 shares of Series E Auction Rate Preferred Stock were  outstanding  with an
annualized  dividend rate of 5.02% per share and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$75,300.

      The holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single class. The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right  currently to elect two Trustees and under certain  circumstances
are  entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Trustees.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Fund's  outstanding  voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the  1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required  to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund trading  practices  involving  certain funds managed by the Adviser.
GAMCO Investors,  Inc. ("GAMCO"), the Adviser's parent company, is responding to
these  requests  for  documents  and  testimony.   In  June  2006,  GAMCO  began
discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry. Since
these discussions are ongoing, it cannot be determined at this time whether they
will ultimately  result in a settlement of this matter. On a separate matter, in
September  2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the SEC that the staff
may recommend to the  Commission  that an  administrative  remedy and a monetary
penalty be sought  from the  Adviser in  connection  with the  actions of two of
seven closed-end funds managed by the Adviser relating to Section 19(a) and Rule
19a-1 of the 1940 Act. These provisions require registered  investment companies
to provide  written  statements to  shareholders  when a dividend is made from a
source other than net investment  income.  While the two  closed-end  funds sent
annual statements and provided other materials containing this information,  the
funds did not send written  statements to shareholders with each distribution in
2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that all of the funds are now in compliance.
The Adviser  believes that these matters would have no effect on the Fund or any
material  adverse  effect on the Adviser or its ability to manage the Fund.  The
staff's notice to the Adviser did not relate to the Fund.
