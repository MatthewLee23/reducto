LETTER FROM THE CEO
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Our firm was built on the strength of MFS Original Research(R), our in-depth
analysis of every security we consider for our portfolios. We've been honing
this process since 1932, when we created one of the mutual fund industry's
first research departments. And we continue to fine-tune this process so that
we can provide strong and consistent long-term investment performance to help
you achieve your financial goals.

While we have achieved strong investment performance in many of our
portfolios, our goal is to achieve the same strong results across all asset
classes. To ensure that our portfolio teams are doing the best possible job
for our firm's clients and shareholders, I am focusing the vast majority of my
time on the three key elements that I believe truly differentiate MFS from its
competitors: people, process, and culture.

PEOPLE

Our people have always been our most valuable resource. Our philosophy is to
deliver consistent, repeatable investment results by hiring the most talented
investors in our industry. We recruit from the nation's top business schools
and hire experienced analysts, both domestically and around the globe.

Our analysts are the engine that powers our entire investment team because
their recommendations have a direct impact on the investment performance of
our portfolios. To demonstrate our ongoing commitment in this area, we
increased the number of equity analysts at MFS from less than 40 at the end of
2000 to over 50 in April 2004. During that same period, we doubled the average
investment experience of our new domestic equity analysts, from
2.6 years to 5.3 years, by recruiting more seasoned analysts to the firm.
Moreover, our international network of investment personnel now spans key
regions of the world with offices in London, Mexico City, Singapore, and
Tokyo, as well as Boston.

One of the major advantages that MFS has over many of its competitors is that
the position of research analyst is a long-term career for many members of our
team, not simply a steppingstone toward becoming a portfolio manager. We have
worked to elevate the stature of the analyst position to be on par with that
of a portfolio manager. In fact, an exceptional research analyst has the
opportunity to earn more at MFS than some portfolio managers.

At the same time, we look within the firm to promote talented analysts who
choose a path toward becoming a portfolio manager. We rarely hire portfolio
managers from our competitors because we believe the best investors are those
steeped in the MFS process and culture. In the past few months, we have
identified four senior research analysts who will assume roles on the
management teams of several of our larger portfolios. MFS is fortunate to have
a deep bench of talented investment personnel, and we welcome the opportunity
to put their skills to work for our clients.

PROCESS

MFS was built on the strength of its bottom-up approach to researching
securities. We have enhanced the mentoring process for our research analysts
by calling on several of our most seasoned portfolio managers to supplement
the work of Director of Global Equity Research David A. Antonelli. These
portfolio managers will be taking a special interest in developing the careers
of our research analysts and strengthening our investment process. Kenneth J.
Enright of our value equity group will work with a team of domestic analysts;
David E. Sette-Ducati of our small- and mid-cap equity team will work with
analysts concentrating on small- and mid-cap companies; and Barnaby Wiener of
our international equity team in London heads the European equity research
team.

We have combined the bottom-up approach of our research process with a top-
down approach to risk controls on portfolio composition. We have a very strong
quantitative team under the leadership of industry veteran Deborah H. Miller,
who represents the equity management department on the Management Committee of
the firm. Quantitative analysis helps us generate investment ideas and, more
importantly, assess the appropriate level of risk for each portfolio. The risk
assessment is designed to assure that each portfolio operates within its
investment objectives.

Additionally, we have increased the peripheral vision of our investment
personnel across asset classes through the collaboration of our Equity, Fixed
Income, Quantitative Analysis, and Risk Management teams. We recently codified
this key aspect of our culture by forming an Investment Management Committee,
composed of key members of these teams. This Committee will work to ensure
that all teams are sharing information, actively debating investment ideas,
and creating a unified investment team.

CULTURE

Teamwork is at the heart of our ability to deliver consistent and competitive
investment performance over time. At MFS, each member of our team is involved
in our success; we have no superstars. The collaborative nature of our process
works to assure a consistent investment approach across all of our products
and provides a high level of continuity in portfolio management because our
investment performance never depends on the contributions of just a single
individual. Our culture is based on an environment of teamwork that allows our
investment personnel to be successful. In turn, we demand superior investment
results from every member of our team.

We have created a meritocracy at our firm based on investment results. We hold
all of our portfolio managers accountable for the performance of their
portfolios and their contributions to the team. We also track the equity and
fixed-income ratings of our analysts so we can evaluate them based on the
performance of their recommendations. We align bonus compensation to
investment performance by weighting rewards to those who have created the
greatest long-term benefit for our shareholders and who contribute most
successfully to the Original Research(SM) process.

The strength of our culture has resulted in a tremendous amount of stability,
both in terms of people and assets under management. Although we have dismissed
members of our team whose performance did not meet MFS' high standards, only
one member of our investment team has voluntarily left the firm over the past
six months, based on a decision to retire from the industry. Similarly, our
firm's assets under management have remained quite steady in the midst of a
challenging enveronment.

In short, we can help you achieve your financial goals by hiring talented
people, following a disciplined process, and maintaining our firm's unique
culture. The recent enhancements described in this letter reflect the
collaborative spirit and the depth of resources in our investment teams.

As always, we appreciate your confidence in MFS and welcome any questions or
comments you may have.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Over the six-month period ended April 30, 2004, long-term U.S. Treasury bond
yields rose modestly, with 10-year treasury yields increasing from 4.29% to
4.50%. The path upward, however, was marked by significant volatility in the
overall bond market.

Previous to the period, in the summer of 2003 and into early September, bond
prices had declined as fixed-income investors, in our view, became concerned
that the economic recovery was accelerating faster than expected.

In the fall and winter of 2003, however, bond prices revived as several
factors combined to drive rates down. Economic reports indicated that
inflation was well contained while job growth remained weak. Although most
other measures indicated the U.S. economy was improving, we believe investors
were concerned that consumer spending might falter because laid-off workers
were not finding new jobs. The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) appeared to sum
up the situation in its statements that interest rates could remain low for
the foreseeable future.

As the period came to a close in March and April of 2004, bonds reversed
direction again. Long-term rates climbed sharply as the United States finally
began to experience strong job growth, and the market began to anticipate that
a Fed rate increase was imminent. Just after the period ended, the Fed's press
release after its May 4 meeting contained the first indication in several
years that rates were indeed going up: "At this juncture, ... the [Federal
Open Market] Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a
pace that is likely to be measured."

The accelerating U.S. recovery over the period was generally positive for
lower quality bonds. Growth in GDP (gross domestic product), business profits,
and other measures pointed toward improving corporate fundamentals - business
factors such as earnings and cash flow growth.

In response, we believe investors moved away from the risk aversion or "flight
to quality" that had characterized the bond market in late 2002 and early
2003. Riskier, lower-rated classes of bonds showed the best performance over
the period, as investors sought out higher-yielding debt. This caused spreads
- - the differences between yields on "AAA"-rated municipals and riskier "BBB"-
rated issues - to tighten (decrease) over the period. Within categories,
lower-rated bonds generally outperformed higher-rated issues. While bonds
across most asset classes were hurt by rising rates in the final months of the
period, lower-rated debt was less affected than higher-rated issues.

For the period as a whole, the performance of municipal bonds relative to
Treasuries of comparable maturities was mixed. On the shorter end of the yield
curve - maturities of 10 years and less - municipal bonds underperformed
Treasuries. On the longer end of the curve, however, municipal bonds
outperformed Treasuries.

In the closing months of the period, municipal bond prices were under pressure
from several factors in addition to the rising rates mentioned earlier. A
large amount of new issuance, particularly in March of 2004, increased the
supply of municipal bonds and put downward pressure on prices. We saw
additional pressure on bond prices in April as investors anticipated
California's largest-ever municipal bond issue in U.S. history, set to take
place in May. A third negative factor for municipal prices toward the end of
the period was seasonal fluctuation, because bond selling has historically
been higher in March and April as investors liquidate positions to pay tax
bills.

QUALITY RATINGS

            "AAA"                           17.9%
            "AA"                             4.3%
            "A"                              8.8%
            "BBB"                           35.0%
            "BB"                            18.4%
            "B"                             13.1%

Percentages based on assets on 4/30/04.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

In the area of credit quality, relative performance was helped by the trust's
overweighting in lower-quality debt relative to its Lehman benchmark. During a
period when spreads were tightening, lower-rated bonds outperformed higher-
rated bonds, and the trust's overweighting in debt rated "BBB" and below
helped relative returns. (The Lehman Index is composed primarily of high-grade
securities rated "A" or better and does not include securities rated below
"BBB.")

The portfolio's positioning on the yield curve also helped relative results.
(A yield curve for bonds is a graph showing yield against time remaining to
maturity.) In managing the trust, we try to pick what we believe is the
optimal spot on the yield curve - a time to maturity that optimizes the
combination  of  yield and risk. Our research has for some time indicated that
the 15- to 20-year part of the yield curve is that optimal spot, and the trust
has historically tended to be overweighted in that area. This overweighting
helped relative performance during the period, as short-term rates rose more
than long-term rates and the yield curve flattened. The trust's relative
overweighting in the longer part of the yield curve, which saw smaller price
declines, and underweighting in the shorter end of the curve, where bond
prices declined more, helped relative performance.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

Duration - a measure of the trust's holdings' sensitivity to interest rate
changes - was the key detractor from the trust's relative performance during
the period. We strive to position the trust with a duration comparable to that
of its Lipper peer group of closed-end high-yield municipal portfolios. During
the period, that strategy resulted in the trust having a longer average
duration than that of its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index
(the Lehman Index). During a period of rising interest rates, that longer
duration meant the trust's holdings, on average, suffered larger price
declines than the holdings in our benchmark.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Geoffrey L. Schechter

INDEX DEFINITIONS
Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index A broad measure of the municipal bond
market.

LIPPER CLOSED END HIGH YIELD MUNICIPAL INDEX - An index composed of 10
closed-end funds (including MFS Municipal Income Trust) that invest at least
50% of their assets in lower-rated municipal debt securities.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities may provide greater returns
but are subject to greater-than-average risk.

The portfolio focuses on companies in a limited number of sectors making it more
susceptible to adverse economic, political, or reulatory developments affecting
those sectors than a portfolio that invests more broadly.

Because the portfolio invests in a limited number of companies a change in one
security's value may have a more significant effect on the portfolio's value.

Government guarantees apply to the underlying securities only and not to the
prices and yields of the portfolio.

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities which may include futures,
swaps, and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

These risks may increase share price volatility. Please see the prospectus for
further information regarding these and other risk considerations.


In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of the
trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on such
terms as the Trustees shall determine.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

 (S) As required, effective November 1, 2001, the trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
     Investment Companies and began accreting market discount on debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended
     October 31, 2002 was to increase net investment income per share by $0.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
     losses per share by $0.01, and to increase the ratio of net investment income to average net assets by 0.07%. Per share,
     ratios, and supplemental data for periods prior to November 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
     presentation.
   + Ratio excludes dividend payment on auction preferred shares.
  ++ Calculated by substracting the trust's total liabilities (not including preferred shares) from the trust's total assets
     and dividing this by the number of preferred shares outstanding.
 +++ Per share amount was less than $0.01.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the trust) is organized as a Massachusetts
business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The trust can invest up to 100% of its portfolio
in high-yield securities rated below investment grade. Investments in high-
yield securities involve greater degrees of credit and market risk than
investments in higher-rated securities and tend to be more sensitive to
economic conditions. Municipal securities backed by current or anticipated
revenues from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively affected
by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the projects or assets or the
inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. If the
Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal security has not
complied with applicable tax requirements, interest from the security could
become taxable and the security could decline in value.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - The trust uses independent pricing services approved
by the Board of Trustees wherever possible to value its portfolio securities.
Portfolio securities are valued at current market quotations where current
market quotations are readily available, or the trust may fair value portfolio
securities under the direction of the Board of Trustees when a determination
is made that current market quotations are not readily available. Bonds and
other fixed income securities (other than short-term obligations) in the
trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated bid price as reported by an
independent pricing service, or to the extent a valuation is not reported by a
pricing service, such securities are valued on the basis of quotes from
brokers and dealers. Prices obtained from pricing services utilize both
dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques which
take into account appropriate factors such as institutional-size trading in
similar groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of
issue, trading characteristics, and other market data without exclusive
reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-counter prices, since such
valuations are believed to reflect more accurately the fair value of such
securities. Bonds and other fixed income securities for which it is determined
that current market quotations are not readily available will be fair valued
under the direction of the Board of Trustees. Short-term obligations with a
remaining maturity in excess of 60 days will be valued upon dealer-supplied
valuations. All other short-term obligations in the trust's portfolio are
valued at amortized cost, which constitutes market value as determined by the
Board of Trustees.

SWAP AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the trust and another party, which is based
on a specific financial index. Cash payments are exchanged at specified
intervals and the expected income or expense is recorded on the accrual basis.
The value of the swap is adjusted daily and the change in value is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Risks may arise upon entering into
these agreements from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contract and from unanticipated changes in the value of the
financial index on which the swap agreement is based. The trust uses swaps for
both hedging and non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may use
swaps to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For non-hedging
purposes, the trust may use swaps to take a position on anticipated changes in
the underlying financial index.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS - Interest rate swap agreements are agreements
to exchange cash flows periodically based on a notional principal amount, for
example the exchange of fixed rate interest payments for floating rate
interest payments which are based on a specific financial index or the
exchange of two distinct floating rate payments. The net receivable or payable
associated with these payments is accrued daily and is recorded as net
interest income or expense. For financial statement purposes, the net interest
income or expense periodically recognized for an interest rate is recorded in
the same line item as any unrealized and realized gains or losses recognized
for that instrument. The primary risk associated with interest rate swap
agreements is that unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of interest rates
could adversely impact the trust.

RATE LOCK SWAP AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into rate lock swap
agreements, which are used to reduce the interest rate risk of the portfolio.
A rate lock swap agreement is a payment or receipt of cash on a specified
future date, calculated as the difference between the strike rate and a
specific index yield on that date. The payment received or made at the end of
the measurement period is recorded as a realized gain or loss in the Statement
of Operations. The value of the swap is adjusted daily and the change in value
is recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. All premium and original issue discount is amortized or accreted
for tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax regulations. Some
securities may be purchased on a "when-issued" or "forward delivery" basis,
which means that the securities will be delivered to the trust at a future
date, usually beyond customary settlement time.

Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the
value of a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal
fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer,
which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of
high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the
security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of
capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization
are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance
an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by
the trust. This amount, for the six months ended April 30, 2004, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net tax-
exempt and taxable net income, including any net realized gain on investments.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.
Distributions paid by the trust from net interest received on tax-exempt
municipal bonds are not includable by shareholders as gross income for federal
income tax purposes because the trust intends to meet certain requirements of
the Code applicable to regulated investment companies, which will enable the
trust to pay exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such interest, if any,
earned on private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986 may be considered
a tax-preference item to shareholders.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for defaulted bonds, capital losses, derivatives, and amortization
and accretion on debt securities.

The  tax  character  of distributions declared for the years ended October 31,
2003 and October 31, 2002 was as follows:

                                                    10/31/03          10/31/02

      ------------------------------------------------------------------

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES - The trust issued 2,800 shares of Auction Preferred
Shares (APS), series T and 2,800 of Auction Preferred Shares (APS), series TH.
Dividends are cumulative at a rate that is reset every seven days for both
series through an auction process. During the six months ended April 30, 2004,
the dividend rates ranged from 1.31% to 1.83%. The trust pays an annual fee
equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred share liquidation value for remarketing
efforts associated with the preferred auction. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the trust in whole or in part at the redemption price equal to $25,000
per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The APS are also subject to
mandatory redemption if certain requirements relating to its asset maintenance
coverage are not satisfied. The trust is required to maintain certain asset
coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the trust's By-Laws and the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

In accordance with the provisions of FASB 150, "Accounting for certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity",
effective for the current period, the trust has reclassified its Auction
Preferred Shares ("APS") outside of permanent equity in the Net Assets section
of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, distributions to APS
shareholders are now classified as a component of the "Increase in net assets
from operations" on the Statement of Operations and Statement of Changes in
Net Assets and as a component of the "Total from investment operations" in the
Financial Highlights. Prior year amounts presented have been reclassified to
conform to this period's presentation. This change has no impact of the net
assets applicable to common shares of the trust.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the trust's average daily net assets and 6.32% of investment income. Management
fees incurred for the six months ended April 30, 2004 were 0.79% of average
daily net assets, including preferred shares, on an annualized basis.

The trust pays compensation to the Independent Trustees ("Trustees") in the
form of both a retainer and attendance fees, and pays no compensation directly
to its Trustees who are officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of
the trust, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to the trust
from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors
of MFS and MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded, defined
benefit plan for retired Trustees. Included in Trustees' compensation is a
pension expense of $5,398 for retired trustees for the six months ended April
30, 2004.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement between the funds and MFS, MFS is entitled to partial reimbursement of
the costs MFS incurs to provide these services, subject to review and approval
by the Board of Trustees. The trust is allocated a portion of these
administrative costs based on its size and relative average net assets. Prior to
April 1, 2004, the maximum amount was based on the following annual percentages
of the trust's average daily net assets:

              First $2 billion                                0.0175%
              -------------------------------------------------------

              -------------------------------------------------------
              In excess of $7 billion                         0.0000%
              -------------------------------------------------------

Effective April 1, 2004 the maximum amount is based on the following annual
percentages of the trust's average daily net assets:

              First $2 billion                                0.01120%
              --------------------------------------------------------
              Next $2.5 billion                               0.00832%
              --------------------------------------------------------
              Next $2.5 billion                               0.00032%
              --------------------------------------------------------
              In excess of $7 billion                          0.0000%
              --------------------------------------------------------

For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the trust paid MFS $24,697 equivalent
to 0.0110% of average daily net assets including preferred shares, to
partially reimburse MFS for the costs of providing administrative services.

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$32,576 for the six months ended April 30, 2004. Also included in transfer agent
and dividend disbursing costs are out-of-pocket expenses, paid to MFSC, which
amounted to $8,715 for the six months ended April 30, 2004, as well as other
expenses paid to unaffiliated vendors.

(4) PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. government securities and
short-term obligations, aggregated $21,043,063 and $23,523,580, respectively.

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The trust's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized 39,777,078 full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The
Trustees have authorized share repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually
of its own shares of beneficial interest. During the six months ended
April 30, 2004, the trust did not repurchase any shares. Transactions in trust
shares were as follows:

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit
agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is
charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the bank's
base rate plus 0.50%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average
daily, unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee
allocated to the trust for the six months ended April 30, 2004, was $373. The
trust had no significant borrowings during the period.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal
course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to market risks
such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These financial
instruments include swap agreements. The notional or contractual amounts of
these instruments represent the investment the trust has in particular classes
of financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts
potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these
instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are
considered.

(9) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

For the six months ended April 30, 2004, 12.1% of securities in the portfolio
of investments are backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of various
financial institutions and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The
percentage of investments insured by or supported (backed) by a letter of
credit from any one institution or agency did not exceed 6.0% of
total investments.

(10) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 31, 2004, MFS settled an administrative proceeding with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding disclosure of brokerage
allocation practices in connection with fund sales. Under the terms of the
settlement, in which MFS neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, MFS
agreed to pay (one dollar) $1.00 in disgorgement and $50 million in penalty to
certain MFS funds, pursuant to a plan administered by an independent
distribution consultant. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an order
of the SEC. The settlement order states that MFS failed to adequately disclose
to the Boards and Trustees and to shareholders of the MFS funds the specifics
of its preferred arrangements with certain brokerage firms selling MFS fund
shares. The settlement order states that MFS had in place policies designed to
obtain best execution of all fund trades. As part of the settlement, MFS has
retained an independent compliance consultant to review the completeness of
its disclosure to fund trustees and to fund shareholders of strategic
alliances between MFS or its affiliates and broker-dealers and other financial
advisers who support the sale of fund shares. The brokerage allocation
practices which were the subject of this proceeding were discontinued by MFS
in November 2003.

In addition, in February, 2004, MFS reached agreement with the SEC, the New York
Attorney General ("NYAG") and the Bureau of Securities Regulation of the State
of New Hampshire ("NH") to settle administrative proceedings alleging false and
misleading information in certain MFS fund prospectuses regarding market timing
and related matters (the "February Settlements"). These regulators alleged that
prospectus language for certain MFS funds was false and misleading because,
although the prospectuses for those funds in the regulators' view indicated that
the funds prohibited market timing, MFS did not limit trading activity in 11
domestic large cap stock, high grade bond and money market funds. MFS' former
Chief Executive Officer, John W. Ballen, and former President, Kevin R. Parke,
also reached agreement with the SEC in which they agreed to, among other terms,
monetary fines and temporary suspensions from association with any investment
adviser or registered investment company. Messrs. Ballen and Parke have resigned
their positions with, and will not be returning to, MFS and the MFS funds. Under
the terms of the February Settlements, MFS and the executives neither admit nor
deny wrongdoing.

Under the terms of the February Settlements, a $225 million pool has been
established for distribution to shareholders in certain of the MFS funds
offered to retail investors ("Retail Funds"), which has been funded by MFS and
of which $50 million is characterized as a penalty. This pool will be
distributed in accordance with a methodology developed by an independent
distribution consultant in consultation with MFS and the Board of Trustees of
the Retail Funds, and acceptable to the SEC. MFS has further agreed with NYAG
to reduce its management fees in the aggregate amount of approximately $25
million annually over the next five years, and not to increase certain
management fees during this period. MFS has also paid an administrative fine
to NH in the amount of $1 million, which will be used for investor education
purposes (NH retained $250,000 and $750,000 was contributed to the North
American Securities Administrators Association's Investor Protection Trust).
In addition, under the terms of the February Settlements, MFS is in the
process of adopting certain governance changes and reviewing its policies
and procedures.

Since December 2003, MFS, Sun Life Financial Inc., various MFS funds, the
Trustees of these MFS funds, and certain officers of MFS have been named as
defendants in multiple lawsuits filed in federal and state courts. The
lawsuits variously have been commenced as class actions or individual actions
on behalf of investors who purchased, held or redeemed shares of the funds
during specified periods, as class actions on behalf of participants in
certain retirement plan accounts, or as derivative actions on behalf of the
MFS funds. The lawsuits generally allege that some or all of the defendants
(i) permitted or acquiesced in market timing and/or late trading in some of
the MFS funds, inadequately disclosed MFS' internal policies concerning market
timing and such matters, and received excessive compensation as fiduciaries to
the MFS funds, or (ii) permitted or acquiesced in the improper use of fund
assets by MFS to support the distribution of fund shares and inadequately
disclosed MFS' use of fund assets in this manner. The actions assert that some
or all of the defendants violated the federal securities laws, including the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as well as fiduciary duties and other
violations of common law. The lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages.
Insofar as any of the actions is appropriately brought derivatively on behalf
of any of the MFS funds, any recovery will inure to the benefit of the funds.
The defendants are reviewing the allegations of the multiple complaints and
will respond appropriately. Additional lawsuits based on similar allegations
may be filed in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
judgments or settlements for damages against MFS, the MFS funds, or any other
named defendant. As noted above, as part of the regulatory settlements, MFS
has established a restitution pool in the amount of $225 million to compensate
certain shareholders of the Retail Funds for damages that they allegedly
sustained as a result of market timing or late trading in certain of the
funds, and will pay $50 million to compensate certain MFS funds based upon the
amount of brokerage commissions allocated in recognition of fund sales. It is
not clear whether these amounts will be sufficient to compensate shareholders
for all of the damage they allegedly sustained, whether certain shareholders
or putative class members may have additional claims to compensation, or
whether the damages that may be awarded in any of the actions will exceed
these amounts. In the event the MFS funds incur any losses, costs or expenses
in connection with such lawsuits, the Boards of Trustees of the affected funds
may pursue claims on behalf of such funds against any party that may have
liability to the funds in respect thereof.

While these developments primarily relate to MFS' open-end funds, there can be
no assurance that these developments, or the adverse publicity associated with
these developments, will not result in an increase to the market discount of
the Trust's shares or other adverse consequences.

I, Richard M. Hisey, certify that:

1. I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of MFS Municipal Income Trust;

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
   a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
   statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
   were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
   information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
   the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and
   cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement
   of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
   this report;

4. The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
   establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
   in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
   registrant and have:

     a. designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
        disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
        supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
        registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
        us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
        which this report is being prepared;

     b. evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
        procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

        evaluation; and

     c. disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
        most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
        in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
        reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting; and

5. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
   registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
   directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
        record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting.
