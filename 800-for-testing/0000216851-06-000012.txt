Investment income dividends and capital gains distributions are taken in
additional shares. This chart covers the years 1991-2005. Fees for the
reinvestment of interim dividends are assumed as 2% of the amount reinvested
(maximum of $2.50) and commissions of $0.05 per share. There is no charge for
reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions or the sale of any shares. These results should not be considered
representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which may be
realized in the future.

                            LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Over the last several years, the energy sector has posted strong earnings and
share price performance. 2005 marked the fourth consecutive year of energy
stocks outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index. In
this annual report we detail our performance for 2005 and share our current
outlook for the energy markets.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW

The early decline in oil and natural gas prices attributed to warm weather and
high inventories was short lived. Daily news headlines quickly focused on
underinvestment by the industry, supply scarcity and limited new resource
potential. While demand growth, especially in China and the United States,
drove energy prices in 2004, supply concerns and worldwide capacity drove
prices in 2005. In fact, U.S. crude oil and natural gas prices increased an
average of 36% and 45%, respectively, while U.S. energy demand was flat. The
driver of the higher prices was concern about limited spare capacity,
especially within OPEC. The late summer hurricane season greatly compounded the
concerns about resource availability. Besides having a devastating impact on
many lives, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita inflicted substantial damage to both
upstream and downstream U.S. infrastructure, further propelling energy prices
higher. Crude prices spiked to over $69 per barrel and natural gas exceeded $15
per thousand cubic feet (mcf). Gasoline prices increased with strong demand and
topped $3.00 per gallon temporarily as a result of the hurricanes. As Gulf of
Mexico supplies gradually returned to the market, commodity prices retreated to
pre-hurricane levels. At year end, crude oil closed at $61.04 per barrel,
compared to $42.12 at the start of the year, and natural gas closed at $11.23
per mcf versus $5.79 at the start of 2005.

Strong energy prices led to a continued increase in onshore and offshore
drilling activity during 2005. U.S. land rig utilization increased during the
year as the rig count rose 23% to 1,372. The increased activity pushed leading
edge day rates (the daily cost to the operator of renting the drilling rig)
about 50% higher for U.S. land rigs and led to a near doubling of average day
rates for offshore rigs. While oil companies experienced higher costs, drilling
service companies benefited from both higher activity and a significant
increase in pricing throughout their product lines. In addition, drilling
contractors in the Gulf of Mexico benefited from a sharp rise in day rates
following the loss of or significant damage to 10 jackup rigs and 5 drilling
platforms during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

The coal market directly benefited from the significant increase in natural gas
prices. Rising natural gas prices led to a continued increase in utilization
rates at U.S. coal-fired power plants. A majority of the higher demand for coal
was satisfied by production out of the western U.S. As a result of the strong
demand and a related increase in environmental compliance costs, the relatively
clean-burning coal from the western U.S. more than doubled in price, while
eastern coal prices were flat. Material and labor costs partially offset the
price improvements.

PERFORMANCE

High earnings and cash flows resulted from robust industry fundamentals and
strong capital discipline. Most companies reduced debt, maintained a strong
financial position, initiated or expanded share repurchase programs and raised
dividends. Petroleum & Resources, as well as the energy indices, significantly
outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The total
return on the Fund's net assets, including income and capital gain
distributions for the calendar year, was 32.0%. Comparable figures for the S&P

(DJOGI) provides an industry-specific measure. Petroleum & Resources' gain on
both a net asset value and market basis of 32% matched that of the DJOGI. This
performance is exceptional when overlaid on our investment objectives of
preservation of capital, generation of reasonable income, and providing the
opportunity for capital gain. These objectives are met by stock selection
across the energy spectrum. Large integrated oil companies, gas distributors,
and utilities provided stability and income while exploration and production as
well as oil service companies contributed greater capital appreciation.
Petroleum & Resources matched the DJOGI while providing diversification and
income. We are diversified in several industries not in the DJOGI, including
coal, chemicals, paper, gas distributors, and water utilities. Additionally, we
invest in foreign energy securities for diversification and income whereas the
DJOGI does not include these equities.

INVESTMENT RESULTS

Net assets of the Corporation on December 31, 2005 were $761,913,652 or $35.24
per share on 21,621,072 shares outstanding. This compares with $618,887,401 or
$28.16 per share on 21,979,676 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2005 was $11,391,783 compared to $8,924,453 for 2004.
These earnings are equivalent to $0.53 and $0.41 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. As a result of
the reorganization of Precision Drilling Corp. into a trust in 2005, the
Corporation received dividend income of $3,032,857 or $0.14 per share. This
accounts in large measure for the increase in investment income over 2004 and
is not expected to recur in 2006. In 2005, our 0.59% expense ratio (expenses to
average net assets) was once again at a low level compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $26,239,852 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $275,422,891 at December
31, 2004 to $428,811,345 at year end, a 56% increase.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Total dividends and distributions paid in 2005 were $1.78 per share compared to
$1.32 in 2004. As announced on November 10, 2005, a year-end distribution
consisting of investment income of $0.25 and capital gains of $1.14 was made on
December 27, 2005, both realized and taxable in 2005. On January 12, 2006, an
additional distribution of $0.13 per share was declared payable March 1, 2006,
representing undistributed net investment income and capital gains earned in
2005, taxable to shareholders in 2006.

OUTLOOK FOR 2006

The first few days of 2006 served as a reminder that oil and gas are
commodities and their prices are subject to inventory levels and weather.
Natural gas prices peaked at more than $11.00 per mcf then declined 16% due to
warm weather and plentiful supplies. However, even after the correction,
natural gas prices are at record high levels due to declining North American
production compounded by the severe hurricane season. Four months after the
hurricanes, about 26% of Gulf of Mexico oil production and 19% of Gulf of
Mexico gas remain shut in, and the impact will linger into 2006. Therefore, we
expect natural gas prices to remain at historically high levels but to
experience volatility due to weather sensitivity. Gas prices for the year 2006
are expected to average slightly less than the $8.33 per mcf average for 2005,
barring another strong hurricane season.

Likewise, as we move through 2006, the same influences that drove world oil
prices in 2005, such as rapid world oil demand growth, low OPEC and non-OPEC
spare capacity, and refinery constraints, will continue to affect oil markets.
Worldwide energy demand growth is expected to continue, with the strongest
gains being experienced in the Asia-Pacific region and the U.S. While
production capacity growth will remain limited, new supplies both in OPEC and
non-OPEC countries should match demand increases. If demand falls, OPEC appears
willing to adjust quotas to maintain the oil price above $50.00 per barrel.
However, geopolitical issues and weather are unknowns and will disrupt the
apparent balance when they occur. We see tight oil supply-demand fundamentals
persisting throughout the year but do not expect them to worsen. Accordingly,
we are anticipating an oil price average of $50-$60 per barrel.

Earnings for companies in the energy sector will be strong as commodity prices
remain at historically high levels. The rate of gain in earnings will slow as
costs increase and revenues reflect lower prices. Large integrated energy
companies and oil service firms should do well in this environment. Companies
will continue to spend cash flow to generate future production gains, directly
benefiting the oil service stocks. As noted earlier, returns for energy stocks
have exceeded the overall market returns for several years. Since fundamentals
still appear strong, we expect our portfolio to continue to perform well in
2006.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

On December 8, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation
over the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the restriction
that shares can only be repurchased when the discount of the market price of
the shares from the net asset value is 6.5% or greater.

From the beginning of 2006 through January 25, 2006, 35,150 shares have been
repurchased at a total cost of $1,216,967 and a weighted average discount from
net asset value of 8.1%.

                                  ----------

DIRECTOR CHANGES

There have been a number of changes in the composition of the Board of
Directors in the past year, some of which were noted in our quarterly reports.
Mr. W. David MacCallan, Chairman of the Corporation for twenty years before
retiring in 1991, passed away in August. Mr. Landon Peters passed away earlier
in the year and Mr. W. Perry Neff retired. Both had been directors for many
years and their advice and guidance are missed. In October, Dr. Susan Schwab
was nominated to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative and confirmed in November,
necessitating her resignation from the Board. Though a director for only five
years, Dr. Schwab brought a fresh perspective and broad international
experience to the Board that will be difficult to replace. To address these
departures, the Board of Directors elected two new directors, Dr. Roger W. Gale
and Dr. Craig R. Smith, who joined the Board effective December 1, 2005. Each
has broad experience in corporate governance. In addition, Dr. Gale brings to
the Board specific knowledge of the energy and utility industries. We welcome
them and look forward to their participation in the Board's activities.

                                  ----------

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Orlando, Florida on March 28, 2006, is expected to be mailed on or about
February 17, 2006.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation's investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its
investment transactions are set forth in the Corporation's registration
statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on national securities
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions And Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Corporation anticipates
making contributions of approximately $430,000 to the plans in 2006.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. The Corporation expensed contributions of $85,570
and $56,822 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
respectively. The Corporation does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. Stock-Based Compensation

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") permits the issuance of
stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up to 895,522
shares of the Corporation's Common Stock at the fair market value on the date
of grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation
rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by the
Corporation during subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not less
than one year after the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant. The
stock appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to
exercise their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the
difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the
Common Stock at the date of surrender. All options terminate 10 years from the
date of grant if not exercised. With the adoption of the 2005 Equity Incentive
Compensation Plan at the 2005 Annual Meeting, no further grants will be made
under the 1985 Plan, although unexercised awards granted in 2004 and prior
years remain outstanding.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2005, and
changes during the period then ended is presented below:

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the year ended December 31, 2005 was $830,097.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan") permits the grant of
stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock incentives to key
employees and all non-employee directors. The 2005 Plan provides for the
issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the Corporation's Common Stock. Restricted
stock was granted to key employees on April 27, 2005 at fair market value on
that date, vesting over a three year period. Restricted stock units were
granted to non-employee directors on April 27, 2005 and to new directors on
December 1, 2005 at fair market value on grant date and vest over a one year
period. The total fair value of units that vested in 2005 was $12,500 due to

</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from restricted stock and restricted stock units
granted under the 2005 Plan are recognized over the requisite service period
based on the fair value of the awards on grant date. Any unearned compensation
is subsequently expensed as services are rendered. The fair value of restricted
shares is based on the average of the high and low market price on the date an
award is granted. The total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to
employees for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $28,884. The total
compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors
under the 2005 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $75,412. As of
December 31, 2005, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $152,834
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the
2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.7 years.

7. EXPENSES

The aggregate remuneration paid or accrued during the year ended December 31,
2005 to officers and directors amounted to $1,504,166, of which $309,662 was
paid as fees to directors who were not officers.

8. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues to receive interest
or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation had securities on loan
of $5,687,500, and held collateral of $5,809,478, consisting of an investment
trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at December 31, 2005, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2005 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

the market price of the shares, and shows the amount of the discount or premium.

Petroleum's daily trading is shown in the stock tables of most daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "PetRs." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Corporation at
(800) 638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Petroleum stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept in
a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 22.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Petroleum
& Resources?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc., as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Petroleum is simple and is handled through our transfer agent.
The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of transfer. They
will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the transfer agent
stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer agent will send
you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your transfer.

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Corporation presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a)
three interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1 and

estimated balance of the net investment income for the year and the net
realized capital gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to
receive the year-end distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this
distribution, all stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement
notice and an election card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
elections by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item 2. Code of Ethics.

On  June 12, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a code  of
ethics  that  applies  to  registrant's principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer. The code of  ethics
is  available  on registrant's website at:  www.peteres.com.
Since  the  code of ethics was adopted there  have  been  no
amendments  to  it  nor  have  any  waivers  from  any   its
provisions been granted.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The  board of directors has determined that at least one  of
the  members  of  registrant's  audit  committee  meets  the
definition of audit committee financial expert as that  term
is  defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The
director on the registrant's audit committee whom the  board
of   directors  has  determined  meets  such  definition  is
Kathleen  T.  McGahran,  who  is  independent  pursuant   to
paragraph (a)(2) of this Item.

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

    (a)    Audit   Fees.  The  aggregate  fees  billed   for
professional services rendered by its independent  auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP,   for   the   audits   of  the
Corporation's  annual  and  semi-annual financial statements
for 2005 and 2004 were $59,201 and $47,142, respectively.

   (b)  Audit Related Fees. There were no audit-related fees
in 2005 and 2004.

   (c)   Tax  Fees.  The aggregate fees billed to registrant
for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP  for  the review of registrant's excise tax calculations
and  preparations of federal, state and excise  tax  returns
for 2005 and 2004 were $7,964 and $8,524, respectively.

   (d)   All  Other  Fees.  The aggregate  fees  billed  for
services  to the Corporation by PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,
other  than for the services referenced above for  2005  and
for  2004  were $800 and $0, respectively.  The $800  billed
for services in 2005 were in connection with the preparation
and  review  of  the registration statement filed  with  the
Securities  and  Exchange Commission relating  to  the  2005
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan

  (e)   (1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy. As of 2005,
all   services   to   be   performed   for   registrant   by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP must be pre-approved by the audit
committee.  All services performed in 2005 were pre-approved
by the committee.

        (2) Not applicable.

  (f) Not applicable.

  (g)   The aggregate fees billed by  PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP   for   non-audit  professional  services  rendered   to
registrant  for  2005  and  2004  were  $7,964  and  $8,524,
respectively.

  (h)  The registrant's audit committee has  considered  the
provision  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of  the  non-audit
services  described above and found that they are compatible
with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs independence.

Item  6. Schedule of Investments - This schedule is included

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES & PROCEDURES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (Petroleum) follows  long-
standing  general  guidelines for the  voting  of  portfolio
company  proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility
to  vote all such proxies. The portfolio company proxies are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Petroleum uses
its  own  staff of research analysts and portfolio managers.
In  making  the  decision to invest in  a  company  for  the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyzes  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of  the company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio  company's management. In general, on the election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe  that the management's recommendation is not in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio   company  management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options
Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/ Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a staggered board of directors. Staggered boards are used to
help  create a roadblock to a possible takeover of a company
or   to   entrench  incumbent  management  and   board.   In
conformance  with  that policy, we will  generally  vote  in
favor  of  shareholder proposals to eliminate the  staggered
election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter   that   can   be  characterized  as   anti-takeover
provisions.  For  example, we generally  vote  in  favor  of
stockholder  proposals to rescind or require  a  stockholder
vote  on  anti-takeover provisions such as poison pills  and
the like.

With  respect  to  so-called  golden  parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within  the authority of the company's management, under the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually  are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance   with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

(a)  (1) Douglas G. Ober, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer,
     and  President,  and  Joseph M. Truta,  Executive  Vice
     President, comprise  the 2 person  portfolio management
     team for the registrant. Mr.  Ober  and Mr.  Truta have
     served as  portfolio managers for the registrant  since
     1991.  This information is as of February 13, 2006. Mr.
     Ober  is  the lead member of  the  portfolio management
     team.  Mr.  Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  receive   investment
     recommendations  from  a  team of research analysts and
     make decisions jointly about any equity transactions in
     the portfolio. Concurrence of both portfolio   managers
     is  required  for  an  investment  recommendation to be
     approved.

     (2)   Mr.   Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  also  comprise   the
     portfolio   management  team  for   registrant's   non-
     controlled   affiliate,  The  Adams   Express   Company
     (Adams),  a  registered investment company  with  total
     net  assets of $1,266,728,652 as of December 31,  2005.
     Mr.  Ober  is Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  of
     Adams  and Mr. Truta is President. This information  is
     as  of February 13, 2006. The Petroleum fund is a  non-
     diversified  fund  focusing on the energy  and  natural
     resources sectors and Adams is a diversified fund  with
     a   different   focus,  and  there  are  few   material
     conflicts  of  interest that may  arise  in  connection
     with  the portfolio managers' management of both funds.
     The  funds  do  not  buy or sell  securities  or  other
     portfolio   holdings  to  or  from   the   other,   and
     procedures  and  policies are  in  place  covering  the
     sharing  of  expenses and the allocation of  investment
     opportunities,    including    bunched    orders    and
     investments  in initial public offerings,  between  the
     funds.

   (3)   The  portfolio managers are compensated  through  a
   three-component plan, consisting of salary,  annual  cash
   incentive     compensation,    and    equity    incentive
   compensation. The value of each component in any year  is
   determined  by  the  Compensation  Committee,   comprised
   solely  of independent director members of the  Board  of
   Directors.  Salaries are determined by using  appropriate
   industry  surveys and information about the local  market
   as  well  as general inflation statistics. Cash incentive
   compensation  is based on a combination of  absolute  and
   relative  fund  performance  over  one  and  three   year
   periods  as  well as individual success at meeting  goals
   and  objectives  set  by the Board of  Directors  at  the
   beginning  of each year. Target incentives are set  based
   on  80% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 60%
   of  salary  for the Executive Vice President.  Two-thirds
   of  each  individual's annual cash incentive is based  on
   fund  performance  and one third on  individual  success.
   The  portion based on performance is determined  using  a
   scale in which the target can be earned by absolute  fund
   pre-tax  performance of 10%. The scale ranges  from  zero
   to  125%  of  target. The result is then modified  by  an
   average  of  the  one and three year performance  of  the
   fund  relative to that of the Dow Jones Oil and Gas Index
   (DJOGI)  and the S&P 500 Index, with 70% based  upon  the
   relative  performance of the fund compared to  the  DJOGI
   and  30%  based on the relative performance  compared  to
   the   S&P   500.  Each  one  percent  outperformance   or
   underperformance by the fund adds or deducts 5% from  the
   percentage  of  target earned based  on  the  scale.  The
   maximum percentage of target which may be earned is  200%
   and  the  minimum is zero. Equity incentive compensation,
   based  on  a plan approved by shareholders in  2005,  can
   take  several  forms.  Following approval  of  the  plan,
   grants  of  restricted stock were made to  the  portfolio
   managers   in   April  2005,  with   vesting   in   equal
   proportions  over a three year period. The  size  of  the
   grants was determined by the Compensation Committee  with
   the  assistance  of  an outside compensation  consultant.
   The   basis   for   the   cash   incentive   compensation
   determinations  for Adams is the same as  for  Petroleum,
   except that the portion of the incentive based upon  fund
   performance uses the S&P 500 Index as the benchmark, over
   a one and three year period. All of the above information
   is as of December 31, 2005.

  (4)  Using a valuation date of December 31, 2005, Mr. Ober
  beneficially owns equity securities in registrant of  over
  $1,000,000. Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity  securities
  in registrant of over $1,000,000.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 13, 2006, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  13, 2006, the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant

required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.

of  1934  and  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed  on  its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
