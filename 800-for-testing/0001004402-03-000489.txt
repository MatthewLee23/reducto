2 Less than $.01 per share.
3 Includes net realized currency gain (loss).
4 Total investment return based on market value differs from total investment return based on net asset value due to
  changes in the relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset value per share. Returns from 1998 have
  been restated to reflect subsequent changes to dividend reinvestment calculations.
5 The increase in the Fund's expense ratio was attributable to extraordinary expenses in connection with a stockholder's
  proxy contest for the election of directors and termination of the management contract and defense against a lawsuit
  against the Fund and its directors plus the impact of a decline in the Fund's net assets.
