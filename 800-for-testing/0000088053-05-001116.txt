ITEM 1.  REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS





SUMMARY OF GENERAL INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE ARE THREE CLOSED-END FUNDS INVESTING IN EUROPEAN EQUITIES MANAGED BY
WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK GROUP:

o     The Germany  Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in equities of major German
      corporations.  It may also invest up to 20% in  equities of other  Western
      European companies (with no more than 15% in any single country).

o     The New  Germany  Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily  in the middle  market
      German  companies and up to 20% elsewhere in Western  Europe (with no more
      than 10% in any single country).

o     The Central Europe and Russia Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in Central
      European and Russian companies.

Please consult your broker for advice on any of the above or call  1-800-GERMANY
(in the U.S.) or 617-443-6918 (outside of the U.S.) for shareholder reports.

These  funds  are  not  diversified  and  focus  their  investments  in  certain
geographical regions,  thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments,  such as currency  fluctuation,  political
and economic  changes,  and market risks. This may result in greater share price
volatility.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   July 22, 2005

Dear Shareholders,

      In the  first  half of the year  (2005),  global  markets  struggled  with
concerns  over  the  rising  price  of oil and its  impact  on  demand.  Markets
succumbed to the pressure in April caused by concerns of slowing economic growth
in the United  States.  Global  markets dipped lower again in June when oil rose
above $60 per barrel,  but recovered when prices moderated to $57 per barrel. In
Europe,  markets  were  impacted by political  uncertainty,  with the French and
Dutch rejecting the European Union constitution at the end of May.  Nonetheless,
European  markets  performed  relatively  well. The  announcement  of Chancellor
Schroder  calling  for early  polls in Germany  was the main  driver  behind the
German  market's strong  performance in the second quarter.  After a weak April,
the DAX index  rallied  during the rest of the period to its highest level since
July 2002,  decoupling  from the negative  impact of rising oil prices.(1)  Even
though stocks have rallied since the start of the year,  the German stock market
continues to trade at a discount to its European peers.

      For the six months  ended June 30,  2005,  the total  return  based on net
asset value of The Germany Fund  declined  5.35%,  and its total return based on
market price decreased by 3.58%.  The fund's  benchmark,  the DAX,  decreased by
4.39% in US  dollar  terms  during  the same  period.  (Past  performance  is no
guarantee of future  results.  Please see page 2, for more complete  performance
information.)

      The fund's  underperformance  relative to its  benchmark was partly due to
the fund's underweight  position in the utilities sector. This sector is seen as
a main beneficiary of a potential change in government,  as it is widely assumed
that a new  coalition  would  reverse the current  antinuclear  stance.  Another
sector that was in the spotlight during the last quarter was the banking sector.
European   cross-border   consolidation   is  finally  gaining  speed.   Italy's
second-largest bank offered to take over  HypoVereinsbank,  which is expected to
create Europe's ninth-biggest bank in terms of market  capitalization.  The fund
did not hold  HypoVereinsbank  due to its  significant  domestic  problems.  The
fund's performance was also affected by its holding in Siemens that announced an
exit solution for its mobile  business.  Though the  announcements  were seen as
positive,  uncertainties about the development of the global economy limited the
performance of the stock.  One of the strongest  contributors to performance was
Adidas  Salomon,  one of the top  performers  within  the DAX  during the second
quarter.  The share price increased after the company  announced the disposal of
Salomon.  Additionally, the last reported numbers proved to be relatively immune
to  lackluster  consumer  spending  in  Europe.   Another  consumer  stock  that
contributed  positively to the fund's performance was Porsche. The strengthening
of the US dollar, which has a positive impact on the underlying profitability of
the company, and the strong product momentum remain strong drivers for the share
price.

      The Germany Fund continued its open-market purchases of its shares, buying
183,700 shares during the first six months of 2005.* The fund's  discount to its
net asset value averaged 12.87% during this period.

      At the July 17, 2005 Board  meeting,  the Board of  Directors  approved an
expansion of The Germany Fund's investment objective and fundamental policies to
include equities of companies in all European countries using the Euro currency.
Under the new investment focus that is subject to stockholder approval, the fund
will  invest  at  least  80% of its  net  assets  in  equity  and  equity-linked
securities of companies domiciled in countries utilizing the Euro currency.  The
proposed  change  to  the  fund's  investment   objective  was  based  upon  the
determination  by the Board of  Directors,  with advice of  Deutsche  Investment
Management Americas, Inc., the fund's manager (the "Manager") and Deutsche Asset
Management  International  GmbH, the fund's investment  adviser (the "Investment
Adviser"),  that  particularly  after  the  introduction  of the Euro as  single
currency and further steps toward European integration, investment opportunities
in large  capitalization  German equities should be expanded to a geographically
broader range of large  capitalization  companies.  The Board  believes that the
economies and  securities  markets of the countries  utilizing the Euro currency
now  have  sufficient   similarities  and  linkages  to  justify  this  expanded
investment focus. Stockholder approval for the investment changes will be sought
at a special meeting to be held in the Fall. In connection with the change,  the
fund would change its benchmark to the MSCI EMU (European  Economic and Monetary
Union) Index.  Additionally,  the Board of Directors also approved a self-tender
offer by the Fund for 20% of the outstanding shares at a price of 95% of the net
asset value per share,  conditioned  on  stockholder  approval of the investment
changes.  The tender offer would  commence  within two months after  stockholder
approval.

Investments in funds involve risk including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified  and primarily  focuses its investments in Germany,
thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country.  Investing
in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic
investments, such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes and
market risks. This may result in greater share price volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the Fund.  Therefore,  the Fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares  will trade at,  below or above net asset  value.  Closed-end
funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.  There is a one-time
public  offering,  and once issued,  shares of closed-end  funds are sold in the
open market through a stock exchange.

The  Fund  has  elected  to  not  be  subject  to  the  statutory   calculation,
notification  and  publication  requirements  of the German  Investment  Tax Act
(Investmentsteuergesetz).  As a  result  German  investors  in the  Fund  may be
subject to less favorable lump-sum taxation under German law.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      QUESTION:  THIS PAST  SPRING,  FRANCE AND THE  NETHERLANDS  REJECTED A NEW
CONSTITUTION FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHAT ARE THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
FUTURE OF THE EU? IS THIS A SIGN THAT MONETARY UNION IS NOT WORKING?

      ANSWER:  While the "no" vote is a setback for the EU, it does not have any
immediate  implications for the German market. Member countries remain committed
to monetary union,  and the EU will continue to be governed by the  constitution
that was in place  before  the vote  this  spring.  Perhaps  the most  important
consequence of the  constitutional  defeat is that  enlargement of the 25-member
union is likely to pause  until the  current  members  get their house in order.
This may be  marginally  positive for Germany as a net payer to the EU. In terms
of monetary  union,  the  failure of recent EU  budgetary  negotiations  has put
pressure  on the euro and could  result in delays to  planned  expansion  of the
Eurozone.

      QUESTION:  GERMAN  ELECTIONS THAT WERE SCHEDULED FOR 2006 HAVE BEEN CALLED
EARLY FOR SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GERMAN MARKET?

      ANSWER:  At the  beginning of July,  Chancellor  Schroeder  requested  and
received a vote of no confidence from the Bundestag  (lower house) to call early
elections.  In mid-September  they are expected to bring increased  momentum for
reforms.  Schroeder  has had  difficulty  implementing  some of the Agenda  2010
reforms due to lack of support within his coalition. Depending on the outcome of
the elections,  a broad CDU/FDP coalition (CDU:  Christich-Demokratische  Union;
FDP:  Frele  Demokratische  Partei)  with  majority  control  in both  houses of
parliament could be established, giving the government power to forge ahead with
labor market,  tax, and health care reforms.  In terms of the stock market,  the
DAX  has  historically  performed  well in  election  years,  outperforming  its
European  peers by more than 20%.(1) Given that many of the reforms would have a
favorable impact on German  companies,  it is expected that the DAX would follow
this  historical  trend. Of course,  past  performance is no guarantee of future
results.

      QUESTION:  GERMAN  SHARES  HAVE  PERFORMED  WELL  DESPITE  AN  UNFAVORABLE
DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENT. ASIDE FROM THEIR FOCUS ON EXPORT MARKETS, WHAT HAVE GERMAN
COMPANIES  BEEN DOING TO  ACHIEVE  SUCH  STRONG  PERFORMANCE  RELATIVE  TO THEIR
EUROPEAN PEERS?

      ANSWER:  Developing a global market for their products has been one of the
most  effective  strategies  for German  companies  to remain  profitable  in an
environment of weak domestic consumption.  However,  German businesses recognize
the importance of remaining  competitive on the production  side as well. One of
the most significant costs for German companies is labor. Because the government
was slow to implement labor reforms,  several German companies took matters into
their  own  hands  and  successfully  bargained  with  labor  unions,   securing
agreements for employees to work longer hours at the same pay.  Other  companies
built production  facilities overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and
tax rates,  a strategy that worked well with the  development  of global markets
for their products.  Now that the outgoing government's reform program looks set
for better speed,  German companies operating primarily in Germany are likely to
be the main beneficiaries.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

The  first  half of the year  (2005)  brought  a series  of ups and downs on the
economic front. Business confidence,  as measured by the ZEW index, and consumer
confidence,  as  measured  by the IFO  index,  both  fell in May (the IFO  index
reached a 20-month low) before  rebounding  in June.  Meanwhile  gross  domestic
product (GDP) grew by 1%  quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter of 2005, the
fastest rate since 2001. In the face of weak domestic  demand,  growth continues
to be driven by net exports.  This trend should  continue,  as the euro weakened
steadily throughout the second quarter,  making German products more competitive
overseas.  Unemployment peaked at 12% during the first quarter and remained well
above 11%  throughout  the half.  As expected,  the  European  Central Bank kept
interest rates unchanged at 2%.

For the second half of the year, the early  elections in Germany can be expected
to affect the economic  environment,  as uncertainty  surrounding  the future of
government  reforms will likely stifle domestic demand. A potential  increase in
the VAT rate could  hinder  private  consumption,  which  would limit GDP growth
through the end of the year.  Once a new  government  is in place and the reform
program is announced,  demand could pick up again as consumers regain confidence
about  the  future.  Overall,  we  expect  modest  GDP  growth  of 1.0% in 2005.
Investment  may also be constrained  until German  companies gain clarity on the
direction of future reforms,  but inflation should remain low and is forecast to
be 1.6% in  2005.  From a  fiscal  perspective,  the  new  government's  biggest
challenge  will be financing the reforms,  as the budget  deficit is expected to
decrease only slightly from last year,  from 3.7% of GDP to 3.6%.  However,  the
prospects  for  German  growth  should  improve  significantly  in  2006  as the
structural reforms that have been set in motion begin to gain traction.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

The observations in this letter reflect our own opinions as of July 22, 2005 and
are based on our own analysis,  and others may have different  opinions.  Events
may not transpire as we or they currently  expect.  Also,  while economic events
can influence  broad market  trends,  political,  monetary and other factors are
also relevant to stock performance. In any event, investment results will depend
on our success in identifying  individual  stocks,  which are influenced by many
factors beyond general economic matters. We cannot predict investment results or
whether they will be successful.

THE GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Germany  Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated  in Delaware on April 8,
1986 as a diversified,  closed-end  management  investment  company.  Investment
operations  commenced on July 23, 1986. The Fund  reincorporated  in Maryland on
August 29, 1990 and on October 16, 1996 the Fund changed from a diversified to a
non-diversified company.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

SECURITIES LENDING: The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions.  The
Fund retains beneficial  ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues
to receive  interest and dividends  paid by the securities and to participate in
any changes in their  market  value.  The Fund  requires  the  borrowers  of the
securities  to  maintain   collateral   with  the  Fund  consisting  of  liquid,
unencumbered assets having a value at least equal to the value of the securities
loaned.  The Fund may invest the cash collateral into a joint trading account in
an affiliated  money market fund pursuant to Exemptive Orders issued by the SEC.
The Fund receives  compensation for lending its securities either in the form of
fees or by earning  interest on invested cash  collateral  net of fees paid to a
lending agent.  Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the loan. The Fund
is  subject  to all  investment  risks  associated  with  the  value of any cash
collateral  received,  including,  but not limited to, interest rate, credit and
liquidity risk associated with such investments.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange  prevailing on the respective  settlement  dates of such
transactions.  The  resultant  gains  and  losses  arising  from  exchange  rate
fluctuations  are identified  separately in the Statement of Operations,  except
for such amounts  attributable to investments which are included in net realized
and unrealized gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts with service providers that contain general  indemnification  clauses.
The Fund's maximum  exposure under these  arrangements  is unknown as this would
involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been
made.  However,  based on  experience,  the Fund  expects the risk of loss to be
remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

THE GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2005   (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

The Fund had a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager").  At its July 12, 2004 Board meeting, the Board approved transferring
the Fund's  Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  to an
affiliated company,  Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. The transfer,
which became effective  September 1, 2004, did not involve any change in control
or actual management of the investment manager, which provides the same scope of
services, utilizes the same people for work on Fund matters and charges the same
fees under the  agreement.  The Fund has an Investment  Advisory  Agreement with
Deutsche Asset Management  International  GmbH (the "Investment  Adviser").  The
Manager and the Investment Adviser are affiliated companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $50 million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $50 million. The
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides  the  Investment  Adviser  with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100 million.  Accordingly,  for the period ended June 30, 2005, the combined
fee pursuant to the Management and Investment Advisory Agreements was equivalent
to an annualized effective rate of .91% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser, in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objectives,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders,  and selects  brokers and dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions on
behalf of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

For the period ended June 30, 2005,  Deutsche  Bank AG, the German parent of the
Manager and Investment Adviser, and its affiliates received $25,512 in brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Fund,  that the Board  determined  were  effected in compliance
with the Fund's Rule 17e-1 procedures.

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for  the  period  ended  June  30,  2005  were   $41,085,770  and   $40,509,823,
respectively.

The cost of  investments  at June 30, 2005 was  $106,978,278  for United  States
Federal  income tax purposes.  Accordingly,  as of June 30 2005,  net unrealized
appreciation  of investments  aggregated  $25,776,044 of which  $26,520,112  and
$744,068 related to unrealized appreciation and depreciation, respectively.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward at December 31, 2004 of approximately $45,332,000,  of which $13,630,000
and  $31,702,000  will expire in 2009 and 2010,  respectively.  No capital gains
distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders  until future net gains have
been  realized in excess of such carry  forward.  In addition,  from November 1,
2004 to December  31,  2004,  the Fund  incurred  approximately  $220,000 of net
realized capital losses.  As permitted by tax  regulations,  the Fund intends to
elect to defer  these  losses and treat them as arising in the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

On June 30, 2005, the market value of the  securities  loaned and its collateral
were  $2,515,991  and  $2,643,390,  respectively.  For the period ended June 30,
2005,  the Fund earned  $227,665 as  securities  lending  fees,  net of borrower
rebates and agency fees.

NOTE 6. CAPITAL

During the period ended June 30, 2005 and the year ended  December 31, 2004, the
Fund  purchased  183,700 and  652,150 of its shares of common  stock on the open
market at a total cost of $1,455,397 and $4,801,379,  respectively. The weighted
average  discount of these purchased shares comparing the purchased price to the
net asset value at the time of purchase was 12.4% and 11.3% respectively.  These
shares are held in treasury.

The Fund offers  stockholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the
plan agent:
