             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Partners and Board of Directors of
SEI Structured Credit Fund, LP

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of SEI
Structured Credit Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of
investments, as of December 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations,
changes in partners' capital and cash flows for the period from August 1, 2007
(commencement of operations) to December 31, 2007. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2007, by correspondence with
the custodian and management of the underlying investment funds. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SEI Structured Credit Fund,
L.P. at December 31, 2007, the results of its operations, the changes in its
partners' capital and its cash flows for the period from August 1, 2007
(commencement of operations) to December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                December 31, 2007

1.   ORGANIZATION

SEI Structured  Credit Fund, LP (the "Fund") is a Delaware  limited  partnership
established  on June 26,  2007.  The Fund is  registered  under  the  Investment
Company  Act  of  1940,   as  amended   (the  "1940   Act")  as  a   closed-end,
non-diversified,   management   investment  company.  The  Fund  offers  limited
partnership interest  ("Interests") of the Fund solely through private placement
transactions  to investors  ("limited  partners") that have signed an investment
management agreement with SEI Investments  Management Corporation ("SIMC" or the
"Adviser"),  the  investment  adviser to the Fund. As of December 31, 2007,  SEI
Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio owned 100% of the Fund.

The Fund's objective is to seek to generate high total returns.  There can be no
assurance  that the Fund  will  achieve  its  objective.  The Fund  pursues  its
investment  objective by investing  in a portfolio  comprised of  collateralized
debt obligations ("CDOs") and other structured credit investments.  CDOs involve
special  purpose  investment  vehicles  formed to  acquire  and manage a pool of
loans,  bonds and/or other fixed income assets of various  types.  The CDO funds
its investments by issuing several classes of securities, the repayment of which
is linked to the performance of the underlying assets, which serve as collateral
for  certain  securities  issued by the CDO.  In  addition  to CDOs,  the Fund's
investments   may  include  fixed  income   securities,   loan   participations,
credit-linked notes, medium term notes,  registered and unregistered  investment
companies or pooled investment  vehicles,  and derivative  instruments,  such as
credit default swaps and total return swaps (collectively with CDOs, "Structured
Credit Investments").

SEI  Investment  Strategies,  LLC (the "General  Partner"),  a Delaware  limited
liability  company,  serves  as the  General  Partner  to the  Fund  and  has no
investment  in the  Fund as of  December  31,  2007.  The  General  Partner  has
delegated the  management and control of the business and affairs of the Fund to
the Board of  Directors  (the  "Board").  A majority of the Board is and will be
persons  who are not  "interested  persons"  (as  defined  in the 1940 Act) with
respect to the Fund.


                                                                               8

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund:

USE OF ESTIMATES

The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements  and
accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
the Fund's  financial  statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual
results could differ from these estimates.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

CDOs and other  Structured  Credit  Investments are priced based upon valuations
provided by independent,  third-party pricing agents, if available.  Such values
generally  reflect the last  reported  sales  price if the  security is actively
traded.  The  third-party  pricing  agents  may  also  value  structured  credit
investments  at an evaluated bid price by employing  methodologies  that utilize
actual market transactions,  broker-supplied  valuations, or other methodologies
designed to identify the market value for such  securities.  Such  methodologies
generally  consider such factors as security prices,  yields,  maturities,  call
features,  ratings and developments  relating to specific securities in arriving
at valuations.

If a price for a CDO or other structured  credit  investment  cannot be obtained
from an independent,  third-party pricing agent, the Fund shall seek to obtain a
bid price from at least one  independent  broker.  In such cases, it is possible
that the independent  broker providing the price on the CDO or structured credit
investment is also a market maker, and in many cases the only market maker, with
respect to that security.

Securities listed on a securities exchange, market or automated quotation system
for which  quotations are readily  available  (except for  securities  traded on
NASDAQ)  are valued at the last  quoted  sale price on the  primary  exchange or
market  (foreign or domestic) on which they are traded,  or, if there is no such
reported  sale, at the most recent quoted bid price.  For  securities  traded on
NASDAQ,  the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price will be used. The prices of foreign
securities  are reported in local  currency and converted to U.S.  dollars using
currency  exchange rates.  Debt obligations  with remaining  maturities of sixty
days or less may be valued at their amortized cost,  which  approximates  market
value.


                                                                               9

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

Securities  for  which  market  prices  are not  "readily  available"  or may be
unreliable are valued in accordance  with Fair Value  Procedures  established by
the Board. The Fund's Fair Value Procedures are implemented through a Fair Value
Committee (the  "Committee")  designated by the Board. When a security is valued
in accordance with the Fair Value  Procedures,  the Committee will determine the
value after taking into consideration  relevant information reasonably available
to the Committee.  Examples of factors the Committee may consider are: the facts
giving rise to the need to fair value,  the last trade price, the performance of
the market or of the issuer's industry,  the liquidity of the security, the size
of  the  holding  in  the  Fund,  or  any  other  appropriate  information.  The
determination of a security's fair value price often involves the  consideration
of a number of subjective  factors,  and is therefore subject to the unavoidable
risk that the  value  assigned  to a  security  may be higher or lower  than the
security's  value would be if a reliable  market  quotation for the security was
readily available.

Certain  Structured Credit  Investments may be structured as private  investment
partnerships. Traditionally, a trading market for holdings of this type does not
exist.  As a general  matter,  the fair value of the Fund's  interest  in such a
private investment fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonable
expect to receive from the private  investment  fund if the Fund's interest were
redeemed at the time of valuation,  determined  based on information  reasonably
available  at the time the  valuation  is made and that the Fund  believes to be
reliable.  Unless determined otherwise in accordance with the Fund's procedures,
the fair value of the Fund's interest in a private  investment fund shall be the
value attributed to such interest, as of that time of valuation,  as reported to
the Fund by the  private  investment  fund's  manager,  administrator,  or other
designed agent. Such a valuation may be a preliminary  valuation and, therefore,
may be later revised or adjusted by the private investment fund. Such adjustment
or  revision  will have no affect on the Fund's net asset  value as of any prior
valuation time. As a practical matter,  the Adviser and the Board have little or
no means of  independently  verifying  the  valuations  provided by such private
investment funds. As a result,  information available to the Fund concerning the
value of such  investments  may not reflect  market prices or quotations for the
underlying assets. In the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not
report a value to the Fund on a timely  basis  and such  fund is not  priced  by
independent  pricing agents of the Fund, the Fund would determine the fair value
of the private  investment  fund based on the most recent value  reported by the
private


                                                                              10

investment fund, as well as any other relevant information available at the time
the Fund values its portfolio.

The Board will periodically review the Fund's valuation policies and will update
them as necessary  to reflect  changes in the types of  securities  in which the
Fund invests.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities,  which qualify as financial
instruments  under  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, approximates the carrying
amounts presented on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  Management of the
Partnership deems these estimates reasonable.

INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security  transactions are recorded on the trade date. Costs used in determining
net realized capital gains and losses on the sale of securities are on the basis
of specific  identification.  Dividend  income is recognized on the  ex-dividend
date, and interest  income is recognized  using the accrual basis of accounting.
Amortization and accretion is calculated  using the scientific  interest method,
which  approximates the effective interest method over the holding period of the
security. Amortization of premiums and discounts is included in interest income.


COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS

The Fund invests in CDOs which include  collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs")
and  other  similarly  structured  securities.  CLOs are a type of  asset-backed
securities.  A CLO is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans, which
may include,  among others,  domestic and foreign senior  secured loans,  senior
unsecured  loans, and subordinate  corporate loans,  including loans that may be
rated below investment grade or equivalent

tranches,  varying  in risk and yield.  The  riskiest  portion  is the  "equity"
tranche  which bears the bulk of  defaults  from the bonds or loans in the trust
and serves to protect the other,  more senior  tranches  from default in all but
the most severe circumstances.  Since it is partially protected from defaults, a
senior  tranche from a CDO trust  typically  has a higher rating and lower yield
than their underlying securities, and can be rated investment grade. Despite the
protection  from the equity  tranche,  CDO tranches can  experience  substantial
losses  due  to  actual  defaults,  increased  sensitivity  to  defaults  due to
collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation
of defaults, as well as aversion to CDO securities as a class.

The risks of an investment in a CDO depend largely on the type of the collateral
securities  and the class of the CDO in which the Fund invests.  Normally,  CLOs
and other CDOs are  privately  offered and sold,  and thus,  are not  registered
under the securities laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized
by the Fund as illiquid  securities;  however, an active dealer market may exist
for CDOs,  allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions.  In addition to
the normal risks associated with fixed income  securities  (e.g.,  interest rate
risk and default  risk),  CDOs carry  additional  risks  including,  but are not
limited to: (i) the possibility that  distributions  from collateral  securities
will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the
collateral  may decline in value or default;  (iii) the Funds may invest in CDOs
that are  subordinate  to other classes;  and (iv) the complex  structure of the
security may not be fully  understood at the time of investment  and may produce
disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.


FEDERAL TAXES

The  Fund's  taxable  income  or  loss  is  reported  by  the  limited  partners
individually.  The  liability for payment of federal and state income tax on the
Fund's earnings is the  responsibility of its partners,  rather than that of the
Fund.  Accordingly,  no provision on liability for U.S. federal income taxes has
been recorded in the financial statements.


                                                                              12

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

FEDERAL TAXES (CONTINUED)

The Fund adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  released  FASB
INTERPRETATION  NO. 48,  "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES" ("FIN 48")
upon  commencement  of  operations  on August 1,  2007.  Based on its  analysis,
management has  determined  that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have a material
impact to the Funds' financial  statements upon adoption.  However,  managements
conclusions  regarding FIN 48 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later
date based on factors including,  but not limited to, further implementation and
guidance  expected  from the FASB,  and on-going  analyses of and changes to tax
laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.


ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING COSTS

Costs incurred in connection with the  organization of the Fund were expensed as
incurred. Initial offering costs have been deferred and are being amortized on a
straight-line  basis  over the first  twelve  months of the  Fund's  operations.
Unamortized offering costs at December 31, 2007, were $39,682.


INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of  indemnifications.  The
Fund's maximum  exposure under these  arrangements  is unknown.  However,  since
inception the Fund has not had claims or losses  pursuant to these contracts and
expects the risk of loss to be remote.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES

At December 31,  2007,  the Fund owned  private  placement  investment  that was
purchased through private offerings or acquired through initial public offerings
and cannot be sold without prior  registration  under the Securities Act of 1933
or pursuant to an  exemption  therefrom.  In  addition,  the Fund has  generally
agreed to further  restrictions  on the  disposition of certain  holdings as set
forth in various agreements entered into in connection with the purchase of this
investment.  This investment is valued at fair value as determined in accordance
with the procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. For the acquisition dates
of this investment,  the enforceable right to acquire this security,  along with
the cost and value at December 31, 2007, please see the Schedule of Investments.


                                                                              13

3.   ADVISER, ADMINISTRATOR AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

The Adviser does not charge a management fee to the Fund.  Limited  partners are
responsible for paying the fees of the Adviser  directly under their  individual
investment  management agreement with the Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the
fees to be paid to the Adviser,  which are ordinarily  expressed as a percentage
of the  limited  partners  assets  managed by the  Adviser.  This fee,  which is
negotiated  between  the  limited  partner  and  the  Adviser,   may  include  a
performance-based fee and/or a fixed-dollar fee for certain specified services.

The Adviser has voluntarily agreed that certain expenses of the Fund,  including
custody fees and administrative fees shall not in the aggregate exceed 0.50% per
annum of the Fund's net asset  value,  and the  Adviser or its  affiliates  will
waive Fund fees or reimburse Fund expenses to the extent  necessary so that such
0.50% limit is not exceeded. The following expenses of the Fund are specifically
excluded  from  the  expense  limit:  organizational  expenses;   extraordinary,
non-recurring and certain other unusual  expenses;  taxes and fees; and expenses
incurred  indirectly by the Fund through its  investments  in Structured  Credit
Investments.  The  Adviser  may  discountinue  all or part of this waiver at any
time.

SEI  Global  Services,   Inc.  (the  "Administrator"),   serves  as  the  Fund's
administrator. The Administrator is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI Investments
Company.  The Administrator  provides certain  administrative,  accounting,  and
transfer  agency  services  to the Fund.  The  services to be  performed  by the
Administrator may be completed by one or more of its affiliated  companies.  The
Fund pays the Administrator a fee equal to 0.10% (on an annualized basis) of the
Fund's Net Asset Value which is accrued  monthly  based on month-end  net assets
and is paid monthly, and reimburses the Administrator for certain  out-of-pocket
expenses.

SEI Investments  Distribution  Co. (the "Placement  Agent") serves as the Fund's
placement agent pursuant to an agreement with the Fund. The Placement Agent is a
wholly owned  subsidiary  of SEI  Investments.  It is not  anticipated  that the
Placement Agent will be compensated by the Fund for its services  rendered under
the agreement.


                                                                              14

4.   ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

The Fund maintains a separate capital account for each of its limited  partners.
As of the last day of each fiscal period, the Fund shall allocate net profits or
losses for that fiscal period to the capital  accounts of all limited  partners,
in proportion to their  respective  opening  capital  account  balances for such
fiscal period (after taking into account any capital  contributions deemed to be
made as of the first day of such fiscal period).

5.   PARTNERS' CAPITAL

The Fund,  in the  discretion  of the Board,  may sell  Interests,  at net asset
value,  to new  limited  partners  and may allow  existing  limited  partners to
purchase additional  Interests in the Fund on such days as are determined by the
Board  in its sole  discretion.  It is the  Fund's  intention  to allow  limited
purchases of Interests only during  designated  subscriptions  periods as may be
established  by  the  Board  or  its  designees  (currently,  the  Adviser)  and
communicated to limited  partners.  The Board or its designee will determine the
amount of Interests offered to limited partners during a subscription  period at
its discretion.  During the established  subscription periods,  Interests may be
purchased on a business day, or at such other times as the Board may  determine,
at the offering price (which is net asset value).  The Fund may  discontinue its
offering at any time.

The Fund is a closed-end  investment  company,  and therefore no limited partner
will have the right to require the Fund to redeem its Interests.

The  Fund  from  time to time  may  offer to  repurchase  outstanding  Interests
pursuant to written tenders by limited partners.  Repurchase offers will be made
at such  times and on such terms as may be  determined  by the Board in its sole
discretion.  In determining  whether the Fund should  repurchase  Interests from
limited  partners  pursuant  to written  tenders,  the Board will  consider  the
recommendations  of the  Adviser.  The  Fund  does not  intend  to  conduct  any
repurchase  offers  until  two  years  after  the  commencement  of  the  Fund's
operation.  After the initial two year period,  the Adviser expects that it will
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to  repurchase  Interests  four times
each year, as of the last business day of March, June, September,  and December.
However,  limited  partners  will not be  permitted  to  tender  for  repurchase
Interests  that were acquired less than two years prior to the effective date of
the proposed repurchase.


                                                                              15

5.   PARTNERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Capital  contributions  received in advance are comprised of cash received prior
December 31, 2007, for which member interests of the Fund were issued on January
1, 2008.  Capital  contributions  received in advance do not  participate in the
earnings of the Fund until the related member interests are issued.

6.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The cost of  security  purchases  and  proceeds  from the sale and  maturity  of
securities, other than temporary cash investments, during the period from August
1, 2007 (commencement of operations)  through December 31, 2007 were $28,405,931
and $3,982,034, respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate cost of investments  for tax purposes was
expected to be similar to book cost of $25,654,798.  Net unrealized appreciation
on  investments  for tax purposes was $200,792  consisting  of $538,069 of gross
unrealized appreciation and $337,277 of gross unrealized depreciation.

7.   CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

In the normal course of business,  the Fund trades various financial instruments
and enters into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. The
Fund's  satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount  recognized in the
statement of assets and liabilities.

The market value of the Fund's  investments  will change in response to interest
rate changes and other factors.  During periods of falling  interest rates,  the
values of fixed income securities generally rise. Conversely,  during periods of
rising interest rates, the values of such securities generally decline.  Changes
by recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in
the ability of an issuer to make  payments of interest  and  principal  may also
affect the value of these investments.


                                                                              16

8.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

The following represents the ratios to average net assets and other supplemental
information for the period August 1, 2007  (commencement of operations)  through
Decemeber 31, 2007:

        TOTAL RETURN (1)
        Total return (3)                                            5.82%

        Partners' capital, end of period (000's)                   $25,034

        RATIOS TO AVERAGE PARTNERS' CAPITAL
        NET INVESTMENT INCOME RATIO
        Net investment income, net of waivers (2)                   9.13%

        EXPENSE RATIO
        Operating expenses, before waivers (2) (4)                  1.54%
        Operating expenses, net of waivers (2) (4)                  0.37%

        Portfolio turnover rate (3)                                21.85%


(1)  Total return is calculated for all the limited partners taken as a whole. A
     limited partner's return may vary from these returns based on the timing of
     capital transactions.
(2)  Annualized.
(3)  Not annualized.
(4)  Expense ratios include  offering costs.  Which are not annualized.  Had the
     offering costs been annualized,  the ratio for "Operating expenses,  before
     waivers" and "Operating expenses, net of waivers" would have been 1.67% and
     0.50%, respectively.


                                                                              17

9.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
Statement  on  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  NO.  157,  "Fair  Value
Measurements." This standard  establishes a single  authoritative  definition of
fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  requires
additional  disclosures about fair value  measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value  measurements  already  required or permitted by existing  standards.
SFAS No. 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal  years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The  changes  to  current  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  from the
application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair vlue, the methods
used to  measure  fair  value,  and the  expanded  disclosures  about fair value
measurements. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund does not believe the adoption of
SFAS No. 157 will  impact the  amounts  reported  in the  financial  statements,
however,  additional  disclosures  will be  required  about the  inputs  used to
develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements  reported
in the financial statements for a fiscal period.


10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent to year end through February 29, 2008 the Fund recorded subscriptions
of  $5,800,000,  which were received by the Fund prior to December 31, 2007. The
Fund paid no redemptions.


                                                                              18

                                December 31, 2007


SEI  Structured  Credit  Fund,  LP (the "Fund") and SEI  Investments  Management
Corporation  ("SIMC") have entered into an investment  advisory  agreement  (the
"Advisory  Agreement").  Pursuant  to the  Advisory  Agreement,  and  under  the
supervision  of the Fund's  Board of  Directors  (the  "Board"),  SIMC  provides
investment advisory services to the Fund,  including managing the investment and
reinvestment of the Fund's assets.

The  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")  requires that
the initial  approval of, as well as the  continuation  of, the Fund's  Advisory
Agreement  must  be  specifically  approved:  (i) by the  vote of the  Board  of
Directors or by a vote of the  shareholders of the Fund; and (ii) by the vote of
a majority of the  Directors  who are not parties to the  Advisory  Agreement or
"interested persons" of any party (the "Independent Directors"),  cast in person
at a meeting  called for the purpose of voting on such  approval.  In connection
with their  consideration  of such approvals,  the Fund's Directors must request
and  evaluate,  and SIMC is  required  to furnish,  such  information  as may be
reasonably  necessary  to  evaluate  the  terms of the  Advisory  Agreement.  In
addition,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") takes the position
that,  as part of their  fiduciary  duties with respect to a fund's  fees,  fund
boards are required to evaluate the material factors applicable to a decision to
approve an Advisory Agreement.

Consistent with these responsibilities,  the Fund's Board of Directors will call
and hold  meetings  each year that will be dedicated to  considering  whether to
renew the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and SIMC. In preparation for these
meetings, the Board will request and review a wide variety of materials provided
by  SIMC,   including   information  about  SIMC's  affiliates,   personnel  and
operations.  The Board  will  also  receive  extensive  data  provided  by third
parties.  This information is in addition to the detailed  information about the
Fund that the Board  will  review  during  the  course of each  year,  including
information that relates to Fund operations and Fund performance.  The Directors
will also receive a memorandum from Fund counsel and independent  counsel to the
Independent  Directors regarding the responsibilities of Directors in connection
with their  consideration  of whether  to renew the Fund's  Advisory  Agreement.
Finally, the Independent  Directors will receive advice from independent counsel
to the Independent Directors,  meet in executive session outside the presence of
Fund   management  and   participate  in  question  and  answer   sessions  with
representatives of SIMC.



                                                                              26

                             (Unaudited) (continued)

                                December 31, 2007


Specifically,  the Board will request and receive  written  materials  from SIMC
regarding:  (a) the quality of SIMC's investment  management and other services;
(b) SIMC's investment management personnel;  (c) SIMC's operations and financial
condition;   (d)  SIMC's   brokerage   practices   (including  any  soft  dollar
arrangements)  and  investment  strategies;  (e) the  Fund's  overall  fees  and
operating  expenses  compared  with  similar  funds;  (f) the  level  of  SIMC's
profitability from its Fund-related  operations;  (g) SIMC's compliance systems;
(h)  SIMC's  policies  on and  compliance  procedures  for  personal  securities
transactions; (i) SIMC's reputation,  expertise and resources in domestic and/or
international  financial markets;  and (j) the performance of the Fund, compared
with the performance of similar funds.

At the June 27, 2007 meeting of the Board of Directors, the Directors, including
a  majority  of the  Independent  Directors,  initially  approved  the  Advisory
Agreement  and approved the selection of SIMC to act as the  investment  adviser
for the Fund. The Board's approval was based on its consideration and evaluation
of a variety of specific factors discussed at the meeting, including:

o  the nature,  extent and  quality of  the  services to be provided to the Fund
   under the  Advisory  Agreement,  including  the  resources  of  SIMC and  its
   affiliates dedicated to the Fund;

o  the  investment  performance  of other  funds  managed by SIMC in  a  similar
   style and how  the  performance  of those other funds  compared with similar
   funds in other fund families;

o  the fact that the Fund  will  not  pay an  advisory  fee  under the  Advisory
   Agreement;

o  the  expected  profitability  of SIMC  and its affiliates with respect to the
   Fund,  including  both direct and indirect  benefits accruing to SIMC and its
   affiliates; and

o  the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows.


                                                                              27

                                December 31, 2007


NATURE,  EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES.  The Board of Directors  considered the
nature,  extent and  quality of the  services to be provided by SIMC to the Fund
and the  resources of SIMC and its  affiliates  dedicated  to the Fund.  In this
regard,  the  Directors  evaluated,   among  other  things,   SIMC's  personnel,
experience,  track record and compliance  program.  Specifically,  the Directors
considered  SIMC's experience in manager selection since that would be the focus
of SIMC's CDO selection.  Following evaluation, the Board concluded that, within
the  context  of its full  deliberations,  the  nature,  extent  and  quality of
services  provided  by  SIMC  to the  Fund  and the  resources  of SIMC  and its
affiliates dedicated to the Fund supported approval of the Advisory Agreement.

FUND PERFORMANCE.  The Board of Directors considered the investment  performance
of  other  funds  managed  by SIMC in a style  similar  to that  which  had been
proposed for the Fund under the Advisory  Agreement (the "Other SIMC Funds") and
how the performance of the Other SIMC Funds compared with similar funds in other
fund  families.  Specifically,  the  Board  considered  that  SIMC  has  managed
structured credit  investments on a separate account basis within the Other SIMC
Funds since May 2005. The Directors considered the performance of the Other SIMC
Funds relative to their peer groups and appropriate indices/benchmarks, in light
of total return,  yield and market trends. As part of this review, the Directors
considered  the  composition  of each peer  group  and  selection  criteria.  In
evaluating   performance,   the  Directors   considered  both  market  risk  and
shareholder risk expectations for the Other SIMC Funds. The Board concluded that
performance  of the Other SIMC Funds was  satisfactory  and therefore  concluded
that, within the context of its full deliberations, the performance of the Other
SIMC Funds supported approval of the Advisory Agreement.

FUND EXPENSES. With respect to the Fund's expenses under the Advisory Agreement,
the  Directors  considered  the fact that the Fund will not pay an advisory  fee
under the Advisory  Agreement.  Instead,  Fund investors (the "Fund  Investors")
will be  responsible  for paying  SIMC's  advisory  fees  pursuant to individual
investment  management   agreements  with  SIMC.  In  addition,   the  Directors
considered  the Fund's net  operating  expense  ratio in  comparison to those of
other comparable funds. The Directors also considered  information about average
expense  ratios  of  comparable  funds  in  the  Fund's  peer  group.  Following
evaluation,   the  Board  concluded  that,   within  the  context  of  its  full
deliberations,  the  expenses  of the Fund  would be  reasonable  and  supported
approval of the Advisory Agreement.


                                                                              28

                                December 31, 2007

EXPECTED  PROFITABILITY.  With regard to expected  profitability,  the Directors
considered all compensation that would flow to SIMC and its affiliates, directly
or  indirectly.   The  Directors   considered   whether  the  varied  levels  of
compensation and  profitability  under the Advisory  Agreement and other service
agreements were reasonable and justified in light of the quality of all services
to be  rendered to the Fund by SIMC and its  affiliates.  When  considering  the
expected  profitability  of SIMC,  the Board took into account the fact that the
SIMC is compensated  by the Fund  Investors,  and not by the Fund directly,  and
such  compensation  with  respect to SIMC  reflects an  arms-length  negotiation
between the SIMC and the Fund  Investors.  Based on this  evaluation,  the Board
concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations,  the profitability
of SIMC would be reasonable and supported approval of the Advisory Agreement.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The Directors  considered the existence of any economies of
scale and whether those would be passed along to the Fund's shareholders through
a graduated  investment advisory fee schedule or other means,  including any fee
waivers  by SIMC  and  its  affiliates.  Based  on this  evaluation,  the  Board
concluded  that,  within the context of its full  deliberations,  the Fund would
obtain reasonable benefit from economies of scale.

Based on the Directors'  deliberation  and their  evaluation of the  information
described  above,  the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent  Directors,
unanimously  approved the Advisory  Agreement  and  concluded  that the Advisory
Agreement is fair and reasonable in light of such services and expenses and such
other  matters as the  Directors  considered  to be relevant in the  exercise of
their reasonable judgment.  In the course of their deliberations,  the Directors
did  not  identify  any  particular   information  that  was   all-important  or
controlling.

The Fund will be adopting Proxy Policies and Procedures at its upcoming March,

ITEM 8.  PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

COMPENSATION. The Adviser compensates each portfolio manager for his management
of the Fund. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of a fixed annual
salary, plus a discretionary annual bonus determined generally as follows.

Thirty percent of each portfolio manager's compensation is tied to the corporate
performance of SEI, as measured by the earnings per share earned for a
particular year. This is set at the discretion of SEI and not the Adviser.
Seventy percent of each portfolio manager's compensation is based upon various
performance factors, including the portfolio manager's performance versus a risk
free rate proxy, such as the Merrill Lynch 3 Month US LIBOR Index, over the past
one, two and three years (50% weighted to one year; 25% to each of the others).
The performance factor is based upon a target outperformance of the Merrill
Lynch 3 Month US LIBOR Index. Another key factor is the portfolio managers' team
objectives, which relate to key measurements of execution efficiency (i.e.,
equitization efficiency, hedging efficiency, trading efficiency, etc.). A final
factor is a discretionary component, which is based upon a qualitative review of
the portfolio managers and their team.


<PAGE>

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. As of the date of this Registration Statement, the
portfolio managers did not beneficially own any shares of the Fund.

OTHER ACCOUNTS. As of December 31, 2007, in addition to the Fund, the portfolio

</TABLE>

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS. Each portfolio manager's management of "other accounts"
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his
management of the Fund's investments, on the one hand, and the investments of
the other accounts, on the other. The other accounts include portions of two
U.S. registered high yield mutual funds and an Irish registered high yield fund
(collectively, the "Other Accounts"). The Other Accounts might have similar
investment objectives as the Fund or hold, purchase, or sell securities that are
eligible to be held, purchased, or sold by the Fund. While the portfolio
managers' management of the Other Accounts may give rise to the following
potential conflicts of interest, the Adviser does not believe that the
conflicts, if any, are material or, to the extent any such conflicts are
material, the Adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that
are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE TIMING AND SIZE OF FUND TRADES. A potential conflict of
interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers' day-to-day management
of the Fund. Because of their position with the Fund, the portfolio managers
know the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund trades. It is
theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this information to
the advantage of the Other Accounts and to the possible detriment of the Fund.
However, the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to
allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time.

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result
of the portfolio managers' management of the Fund and the Other Accounts which,
in theory, may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that
favors the Other Accounts over the Fund. This conflict of interest may be
exacerbated to the extent that the Adviser or the portfolio managers receive, or
expect to receive, greater compensation from their management of the Other
Accounts than the Fund. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest,
it is the Adviser's policy to manage each account based on its investment
objectives and related restrictions and, as discussed above, the Adviser has
adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment
opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a manner consistent
with each account's investment objectives and related restrictions. For example,
while the portfolio managers may buy for an Other Account securities that differ
in identity or quantity from securities bought for the Fund, such an approach
might not be suitable for the Fund given its investment objectives and related
restrictions.

The Adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors
in the SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio (the "Offshore Feeder Fund"),
a segregated portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a
segregated portfolio company established in the Cayman Islands, that acts as a
feeder fund for the Fund, whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset
value of such investor's investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund over a given
period shall be payable to the Adviser. This arrangement may create an incentive
for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that are riskier or


<PAGE>

more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest because the Adviser
will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the Offshore
Feeder Fund's assets if the value of its investment in the Fund declines.
Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Adviser's
policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related
restrictions and the Adviser believes that it has designed policies and
procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way.

                                 CODE OF ETHICS

                            Adopted Under Rule 17j-l

While  affirming  its  confidence  in the integrity and good faith of all of its
officers  and  directors,  each  of  SEI  Opportunity  Master  Fund,  L.P.,  SEI
Opportunity  Fund, L.P., and SEI Structured  Credit Fund, L.P. (each a "Company"
collectively,  the  "Companies"),  recognize  that the  knowledge  of present or
future portfolio transactions and, in certain instances,  the power to influence
portfolio transactions which may be possessed by certain officers, employees and
directors could place such individuals,  if they engage in personal transactions
in securities  which are eligible for investment by each Company,  in a position
where their personal interest may conflict with that of each Company.

In view of the foregoing and of the  provisions  of Rule  17j-l(b)(I)  under the
Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), each Company has determined to
adopt this Code of Ethics to specify and prohibit  certain types of transactions
deemed to create  conflicts  of interest (or at least the  potential  for or the
appearance  of such a conflict),  and to establish  reporting  requirements  and
enforcement procedures.

A.   STATEMENT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES

     In recognition of the trust and confidence placed in each Company by its
shareholders, and to give effect to each Company's belief that its operations
should be directed to the benefit of its shareholders, each Company hereby
adopts the following general principles to guide the actions of its directors,
officers and employees:

     (l)  The interests of each Company's shareholders are paramount, and all of
     each Company's personnel must conduct themselves and their operations to
     give maximum effect to this tenet by assiduously placing the interests of
     the shareholders before their own.

     (2)  All personal transactions in securities by each Company's personnel
     must be accomplished so as to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
     interest on the part of such personnel with the interests of each Company
     and its shareholders.

     (3)  Each Company's personnel must avoid actions or activities that allow
     (or appear to allow) a person to profit or benefit from his or her position
     with respect to each Company, or that otherwise bring into question the
     person's independence or judgment.


B.   DEFINITIONS

     (1)  "Access Person" shall mean

          (i)    each director or officer of a Company,

          (ii)   each employee of each Company (or of any company in a control
          relationship to the Company) who, in connection with his or her
          regular functions or duties, makes, participates in, or obtains
          information regarding the purchase or sale of a security by each
          Company, or whose functions relate to the making of any
          recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales, and

          (iii)  any natural person in a control relationship to each Company
          who obtains information concerning recommendations made to or by the
          Company with respect to the purchase or sale of a security by any
          Company, or whose functions relate to the making of any
          recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales;

          (iv)   each director, officer or general partner of any principal
          underwriter for a Company, but only where such person in the ordinary
          course either makes, participates in, or obtains information regarding
          the purchase or sale of securities by a Company, or whose functions
          relate to the makingof recommendations regarding securities to a
          Company; and

          (v)    any natural person in a control relationship with a Company or
          any of the Company's advisers or subadvisers who obtains information
          concerning


<PAGE>

          recommendations made to the Company with regard to the purchase or
          sale of a security.

     (2)  "Beneficial ownership" of a security is to be determined in the same
     manner as it is for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934. This means that a person should generally consider himself the
     beneficial owner of any securities in which he has a direct or indirect
     pecuniary interest. In addition, a person should consider himself the
     beneficial owner of securities held by his spouse, his minor children, a
     relative who shares his home, or other persons by reason of any contract,
     arrangement, understanding or relationship that provides him with sole or
     shared voting or investment power.

     (3)  "Control" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
     2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act. Section 2(a)(9) provides that "control" means the
     power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies
     of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official
     position with such company. Ownership of 25% or more of a company's
     outstanding voting security is presumed to give the holder thereof control
     over the company. Such presumption may be countered by the facts and
     circumstances of a given situation.

     (4)  "Independent Director" means a Director of a Company who is not an
     "interested person" of that Company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19)
     of the 1940 Act.

     (5)  "Initial Public Offering" ("IPO") means an offering of Securities
     registered under the Securities Act of 1933, the issuer of which,
     immediately before registration, was not subject to the reporting
     requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934.

     (6)  "Private Placement" means an offering that is exempt from registration
     under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) or Section 4(6)
     in the Securities Act of 1933.

     (7)  "Special Purpose Investment Personnel" means each Access Person who,
     in connection with his or her regular functions (including, where
     appropriate, attendance at Board meetings and other meetings at which the
     official business of a Company is discussed or carried on), obtains
     contemporaneous information regarding the purchase or sale of a security by
     a Company. Special Purpose Investment Personnel shall occupy this status
     only with respect to those securities as to which he or she obtains such
     contemporaneous information.

     (8)  "Purchase or sale of a security" includes, among other things, the
     writing of an option to purchase or sell a security.

     (9)  "Security" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
     2(a)(36) of the 1940 Act, except that it shall not include securities
     issued by the Government of the United States or an agency thereof,
     bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of


<PAGE>

     deposit, commercial paper and registered, open-end mutual funds and high
     quality short-term debt instruments, including repurchase agreements.

     (10) A Security "held or to be acquired" by a Company means (A) any
     Security which, within the most recent fifteen days, (i) is or has been
     held by a Company or (ii) is being or has been considered by a Company's
     investment adviser or subadviser for purchase by the Company; (B) and any
     option to purchase or sell and any Security convertible into or
     exchangeable for any Security described in (A) above.

     (11) A Security is "being purchased or sold" by a Company from the time
     when a purchase or sale program has been communicated to the person who
     places the buy and sell orders for the Company until the time when such
     program has been fully completed or terminated.


C.   Prohibited Purchases and Sales of Securities

     (1)  No Access Person shall, in connection with the purchase or sale,
     directly or indirectly, by such person of a Security held or to be acquired
     by a Company:

          (A)    employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud such Company;

          (B)    make to such Company any untrue statement of a material fact or
          omit to state to such Company a material fact necessary in order to
          make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
          they are made, not misleading;

          (C)    engage in any act, practice or course of business which would
          operate as a fraud or deceit upon such Company; or

          (D)    engage in any manipulative practice with respect to a Company.

     (2)  No Special Purpose Investment Personnel may purchase or sell, directly
     or indirectly, any Security as to which such person is a Special Purpose
     Investment Personnel in which he had (or by reason of such transaction
     acquires) any Beneficial Ownership at any time within 7 calendar days
     before or after the time that the same (or a related) Security is being
     purchased or sold by any Company.

     (3)  No Special Purpose Investment Personnel may sell a Security as to
     which he or she is a Special Purpose Investment Personnel within 60 days of
     acquiring beneficial ownership of that Security.


D.   Additional Restrictions and Requirements

     (1)  Pre-approval of IPOs and Private Placements -Each Access Person must
     obtain approval from the Review Officer before acquiring beneficial
     ownership of any securities offered in connection with an IPO or a Private
     Placement.


<PAGE>

     (2)  No Access Person shall accept or receive any gift of more than de
     minimis value from any person or entity that does business with or on
     behalf of a Company.

     (3)  Each Access Person (other than a Company's Independent Directors and
     its Directors and officers who are not currently affiliated with or
     employed by the Company's investment adviser or principal underwriter) who
     is not required to provide such information under the terms of a code of
     ethics described in Section VII hereof must provide to the Review Officer a
     complete listing of all securities owned by such person as of the end of a
     calendar quarter. The initial listing must be submitted no later than
     January 31, 2001 (or within 10 days of the date upon which such person
     first becomes an Access Person of the Company), and each update thereafter
     must be provided no later than 30 days after the start of the subsequent
     year.


E.   Reporting Obligations

     (1)  Each Access Person (other than a Company's Independent Directors)
     shall report all transactions in Securities in which the person has, or by
     reason of such transaction acquires, any direct or indirect beneficial
     ownership. Reports shall be filed with the Review Officer quarterly. The
     Review Officer shall submit confidential quarterly reports with respect to
     his or her own personal securities transactions to an officer designated to
     receive his or her reports ("Alternate Review Officer"), who shall act in
     all respects in the manner prescribed herein for the Review Officer.

     (2)  Every report shall be made not later than 10 days after the end of the
     calendar quarter in which the transaction to which the report relates was
     effected, and shall contain the following information:

          (A)    The date of the transaction, the title and the number of shares
          or the principal amount of each security involved;

          (B)    The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or any
          other type of acquisition or disposition);

          (C)    The price at which the transaction was effected;

          (D)    The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the
          transaction was effected; and

          (E)    The date the report was submitted by the Access Person.

     (3)  In the event no reportable transactions occurred during the quarter,
     the report should be so noted and returned signed and dated.

     (4)  An Access Person who would otherwise be required to report his or her
     transactions under this Code shall not be required to file reports pursuant
     to this


<PAGE>

     Section V where such person is required to file reports pursuant to a code
     of ethics described in Section VII, hereof.

     (5)  An Independent Director shall report transactions in Securities only
     if the Director knew at the time of the transaction or, in the ordinary
     course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a director, should have
     known, that during the IS-day period immediately preceding or following the
     date of the transaction, such security was purchased or sold, or was being
     considered for purchase or sale, by a Company. (The "should have known"
     standard implies no duty of inquiry, does not presume there should have
     been any deduction or extrapolation from discussions or memoranda dealing
     with tactics to be employed meeting a Company's investment objectives, or
     that any knowledge is to be imputed because of prior knowledge of the
     Company's portfolio holdings, market considerations, or the Company's
     investment policies, objectives and restrictions.)

     (6)  Any such report may contain a statement that the report shall not be
     construed as an admission by the person making such report that he has any
     direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the security to which the report
     relates.

     (7)  Each Independent Director shall report the name of any publicly-owned
     company (or any company anticipating a public offering of its equity
     securities) and the total number of its shares beneficially owned by him or
     her if such total ownership is more than 1/2 of 1% of the company's
     outstanding shares. Such report shall be made promptly after the date on
     which the Director's ownership interest equaled or exceeded 1/2 of 1%.


F.   Review and Enforcement

     (l)  The Review Officer shall compare all reported personal securities
     transactions with completed portfolio transactions of a Company and a list
     of securities being considered for purchase or sale by the Company's
     adviser(s) and subadviser(s) to determine whether a violation of this Code
     may have occurred. Before making any determination that a violation has
     been committed by any person, the Review Officer shall give such person an
     opportunity to supply additional explanatory material.

     (2)  If the Review Officer determines that a violation of this Code may
     have occurred, he shall submit his written determination, together with the
     confidential monthly report and any additional explanatory material
     provided by the individual, to the President of such Company and outside
     counsel, who shall make an independent determination as to whether a
     violation has occurred.

     (3)  If the President and outside counsel find that a violation has
     occurred, the President shall impose upon the individual such sanctions as
     he or she deems appropriate and shall report the violation and the sanction
     imposed to the Board of Directors of such Company.


<PAGE>

     (4)  No person shall participate in a determination of whether he has
     committed a violation of the Code or of the imposition of any sanction
     against himself. If a securities transaction of the President is under
     consideration, any Vice President shall act in all respects in the manner
     prescribed herein for the President.


G.   Investment Adviser's, Administrator's or Principal Underwriter's Code of
     Ethics

Each investment adviser, administrator or manager (where applicable), and
principal underwriter of a Company shall:

     (1)  Submit to the Board of Directors of such Company a copy of its code of
     ethics adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-l, which code shall comply with the
     recommendations of the Investment Company Institute's Advisory Group on
     Personal Investing or be accompanied by a written statement explaining any
     differences and supplying the rationale therefor;

     (2)  Promptly report to the appropriate Company in writing any material
     amendments to such code of ethics;

     (3)  Promptly furnish to such Company upon request copies of any reports
     made pursuant to such Code by any person who is an Access Person as to the
     Company; and

     (4)  Shall immediately furnish to such Company, without request, all
     material information regarding any violation of such Code by any person who
     is an Access Person as to the Company.


H.   Annual Written Report to the Board

At least once a year, the Review Officer for each Company will provide the Board
of Directors a WRITTEN report that includes:

     (1)  Issues Arising Under the Code -The Report will describe any issue(s)
     that arose during the previous year under the Code, including any material
     Code violations, and any resulting sanction(s).

     (2)  Certification -The Report will certify to the Board of Directors that
     the each Company has adopted measures reasonably necessary to prevent its
     personnel from violating the Code currently and in the future.

     (3)  A copy of each report made by an officer or director pursuant to this

     end of the fiscal year in which it is made, the first two years in an
     easily accessible place; and

     approve the acquisition of Securities in an IPa or a Private Placement,
     shall be preserved for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year
     in which the approval is granted.

     information filed with a Company pursuant to this Code shall be treated as
