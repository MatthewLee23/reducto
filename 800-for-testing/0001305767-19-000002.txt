President's Letter

Since 1928, active portfolio management based on in-depth, fundamental
research, has been the foundation of Amundi Pioneer's investment approach. We
believe an active management investment strategy is a prudent approach to
investing, especially during periods of market volatility, which can result
from any number of risk factors, including slow U.S. economic growth, rising
interest rates, and geopolitical factors. Of course, in today's global economy,
risk factors extend well beyond U.S. borders. In fact, it's not unusual for
political and economic issues on the international front to cause or contribute
to volatility in U.S. markets.

At Amundi Pioneer, each security under consideration is researched by our team
of experienced investment professionals, who communicate directly with the
management teams of those companies. At the end of this research process, if we
have conviction in a company's business model and management team, and regard
the security as a potentially solid investment opportunity, an Amundi Pioneer
portfolio manager makes an active decision to invest in that security. The
portfolio resulting from these decisions represents an expression of his or her
convictions, and strives to balance overall risk and return opportunity.

As an example, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index -- the predominant benchmark for
many U.S. Large-Cap Core Equity funds -- has 500 stocks. An Amundi Pioneer
portfolio manager chooses to invest in only those companies that he or she
believes can offer the most attractive opportunities to pursue the fund's
investment objective, thus potentially benefiting the fund's shareowners. This
process results in a portfolio that does not own all 500 stocks, but a much
narrower universe.

The same active decision to invest in a company is also applied when we decide
to sell a security, either due to changing fundamentals, valuation concerns, or
market risks. We apply this active decision-making across all of our equity,
fixed-income, and global portfolios.

Today, as investors, we have many options. It is our view that active
management can serve shareholders well not only when markets are thriving, but
also during periods of market volatility and uncertainty, thus making it a
compelling investment choice. As you consider the many choices today, we
encourage you to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall
investment plan that addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to
implement such a plan in a disciplined manner.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/19

In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that
influenced the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the six-month
period ended May 31, 2019. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and a portfolio
manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q     How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2019?

A     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 3.34% at net asset value (NAV) and
      2.62% at market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2019,
      while the Trust's benchmark, the Standard & Poor's/Loan Syndications &
      Trading Association Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index), returned
      2.80% at NAV. Unlike the Trust, the S&P/LSTA Index does not use leverage.
      While the use of leverage increases investment opportunity, it also
      increases investment risk.

      During the same six-month period, the average return at NAV of the 31
      closed end funds in Morningstar's Bank Loan Closed End Funds category
      (which may or may not be leveraged), was 2.25%, and the average return at
      market price of the 31 closed end funds in the same Morningstar category
      was 4.74%.

      The shares of the Trust were selling at a 14.23% discount to NAV on May
      31, 2019. Comparatively, the shares of the Trust were selling at a 13.62%
      discount to NAV on November 30, 2018.

      The Trust's standardized, 30-day SEC yield was 5.78% on May 31, 2019*.

Q     How would you describe the investment environment in general, and for bank
      loans in particular, during the six-month period ended May 31, 2019?

A     Late 2018 saw investors' sentiment for so-called risk assets weaken, based
      on a range of concerns. The concerns included U.S.-China trade tensions,
      softening economic growth overseas, Italy's budget crisis, and other
      political uncertainties.

      In mid-December, the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Fed) met
      expectations and raised its short-term interest-rate target to the 2.25%
      to 2.50% range, the fourth increase in calendar year 2018, while noting
      the potential for additional rate hikes in 2019. In combination with signs
      of slowing global economic growth and yet another setback in the "Brexit"
      negotiations in the United Kingdom, fears that the Fed would overshoot on

*     The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
      hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
      Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

      interest rates led to a spike in volatility in the market for riskier
      assets. December 2018 saw the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield decline from
      3.01% to 2.69%, as investors sought a safe haven from the market turmoil.
      Energy-related issues also declined sharply as crude oil prices plunged
      over the fourth quarter, mainly due to concerns about a weaker demand
      outlook and higher-than-expected supply driven in part by a loosening of
      U.S. sanctions on Iran.

      Risk-oriented assets rebounded sharply in January of 2019, however, as the
      Fed pivoted on monetary policy and took on a less aggressive tone,
      announcing an early end to its balance-sheet reduction program while also
      indicating it would become more "data dependent" with regard to
      interest-rate policy, thus putting further rate increases on hold, at
      least temporarily. In addition to the Fed's policy actions, weak economic
      data out of the euro zone and China led to renewed policy accommodations
      from both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the People's Bank of China.
      Modest progress on trade matters, a firming in oil prices, and positive
      corporate earnings reports also helped boost sentiment for
      credit-sensitive assets during the first quarter of 2019.

      While the overall pace of gains moderated and there was some interim
      market volatility, credit-sensitive assets continued to outperform
      interest-rate-sensitive issues through the end of April, before wavering
      again in May on another potential escalation in the U.S.-China trade
      situation, as the Trump administration announced plans to implement a 25%
      tariff on some $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

      The bank-loan market finished the six-month period in positive territory,
      despite a very difficult first month (December 2018). The loan asset class
      returned -2.54% in December, as massive outflows from loan retail mutual
      funds had a major negative impact on the market. Comments from Fed Chair
      Powell indicating that future rate increases were likely to be curtailed
      were a major factor in the exodus from the loan market late in 2018, as
      the prospect of stabilizing interest rates lessened the attractiveness of
      the floating-rate feature of bank loans. The outflows were further fueled
      by heightened media coverage focused on the potential end of the current
      economic cycle and a possible recession in the near term, which would
      negatively impact the loan market. The negative effects of the market
      outflows on loan performance were exacerbated by low levels of liquidity
      at year-end, as collateralized loan obligation (CLO) formation paused
      after a record calendar year in terms of volume.

      Despite the struggles experienced in December, patient loan investors
      eventually benefited from the mostly positive credit-market conditions
      that existed between January and May 2019, as bank loans recouped the bulk
      of their late-2018 losses.

Q     What factors had the biggest effects on the Trust's benchmark-relative
      performance during the six-month period ended May 31, 2019?

A     The Trust's allocations across industries within the portfolio's loan
      positions had a modest impact on benchmark-relative performance, with
      positive contributions to relative returns coming from the portfolio's
      underweight to business & equipment services loans, and overweights to
      conglomerates and food products. The portfolio's out-of-benchmark
      allocation to high-yield corporate bonds also had a slight positive impact
      on the Trust's benchmark-relative performance over the six-month period.

      A portfolio underweight to technology -- electronics in particular --
      detracted from the Trust's benchmark-relative performance for the
      six-month period, as did an overweight to aerospace & defense loans.
      Security selection results within the portfolio's allocation to the home
      furnishings sector also detracted from the Trust's benchmark-relative
      performance. Meanwhile, oil and gas-related holdings were a major drag on
      the Trust's absolute returns over the six-month period, given the general
      weakness in oil prices.

      With regard to individual loans held in the Trust's portfolio, positive
      contributions to benchmark-relative returns for the six-month period were
      led by PetSmart, which announced an initial public offering of its online
      retailer Chewy.com. The move is expected to improve the pet supply
      retailer's working capital. Other positive contributors to the Trust's
      benchmark-relative performance were positions in wireline company
      Windstream and cosmetics firm Revlon. Windstream's loan price benefited
      when the legal issues surrounding the spinoff of its communications
      infrastructure assets were resolved. Revlon's loans benefited from
      improved market sentiment as the company's sales rebounded following a
      period of inventory adjustments by key customers.

      On the downside, the portfolio's position in Serta Simmons Bedding (Serta)
      detracted from the Trust's benchmark-relative performance during the
      six-month period, due to a downgrade by credit-rating agencies. Serta's
      earnings results have been negatively affected by competition from
      direct-to-consumer sellers, and by the bankruptcies of two of its major
      customers. Another detractor from the Trust's benchmark-relative returns
      was the loan for Constellis, as earnings results for the security services
      firm have softened due to lower levels of government spending on overseas
      contingency operations. Finally, the loan price for energy
      exploration-and-production company Encino declined during the six-month
      period on oil price volatility, and so the position had a negative effect
      on the Trust's benchmark-relative results.

<PAGE>

Q     How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the six-month
      period ended May 31, 2019?

A     The Trust employs leverage through a credit agreement.

      As of May 31, 2019, 31.9% of the Trust's total managed assets were
      financed by leverage, compared with 32.5% of the Trust's total managed
      assets financed by leverage at the start of the period on November 30,
      2018. The Trust's leverage ratio decreased primarily due to a reduction in
      the absolute amount of funds borrowed by the Trust during the 6-month
      period.

Q     Did the Trust have any investments in any derivative securities during the
      six-month period ended May 31, 2019? If so, did the derivatives have any
      material effect on performance?

A     We invested the Trust in high-yield bond credit-default swap indices
      during the six-month period, principally to maintain portfolio liquidity.
      The derivatives had a slight positive impact on the Trust's performance.

Q     Did the Fund's distributions** to shareholders change during the six-month
      period ended May 31, 2019?

A     No, the Trust's distributions remained stable over the six-month period.

Q     What is your investment outlook and how have you positioned the Trust
      heading into the second half of its fiscal year?

A     We view loan fundamentals as positive and expect defaults in the loan
      market to remain manageable. To illustrate, the default rate on loans for
      the 12 months ended May 31, 2019, was 1.00% by loan volume, easily below
      the historical average of slightly more than 3%. The loan default rate by
      number of issuers was 1.56%, also below the long-term average. The default
      rate on loans held in the Trust's portfolio has remained well below that
      of the overall market.

      Potential risks to our outlook for the loan market include an unexpected
      decline in corporate earnings resulting from some combination of higher
      tariffs, rising wage growth, and slowing global economic growth.

      With regard to the Trust's positioning, the loan market has recently seen
      an uptick in the amount of leverage utilized in buyout activity, and so we
      have refrained from investing the portfolio in a number of the more
      levered deals. Instead, we have been emphasizing investments in loans to
      borrowers with strong cash flows, which we believe may help to ensure that
      those borrowers can pay their obligations should interest rates rise
      meaningfully from here, or if there is a downturn in market conditions.

**    Distributions are not guaranteed.

      The average quality of loans held in the Trust's portfolio declined from
      BB- to B+ over the six-month period ended May 31, 2019. The change was
      driven primarily by the composition of the new-issue loan market over the
      period. We were comfortable with the changes in portfolio quality, as we
      believe economic conditions will remain favorable, at least in the near
      term. In terms of industries, we marginally increased the Trust's
      allocations to consumer cyclical and health care over the six-month
      period, while marginally decreasing exposures to communications, finance,
      and insurance.

      We have maintained the Trust's out-of-benchmark allocations to high-yield
      corporates, credit-default-swap indices, and insurance-linked securities
      (ILS). A significant move higher in interest rates appears to have become
      less of a near-term risk to the high-yield asset class, due to the
      aforementioned policy pivot by the Fed. Meanwhile, we view maintaining a
      modest position in ILS as helping to improve the Trust's long-term
      risk/reward profile, based on the higher yields and potential
      diversification*** benefits provided by the asset class.

      We believe bank loans demonstrated their investment value in last year's
      rising-rate environment, as the asset class substantially outperformed
      both high-yield and investment-grade corporate bonds prior to the Fed's
      policy reversal entering 2019. With the current U.S. recovery in its 10th
      year, we view any modest decline in the federal funds rate over the next
      few quarters as likely to support bank-loan market sentiment by helping to
      extend the credit cycle.

      We believe bank loans can continue to be an attractive element of
      income-oriented investors' portfolios, based on their relatively low
      correlation with other asset classes, even if loans are not as likely to
      benefit from rising interest rates over the near term.

of Trust securities.

All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal.
In the past several years, financial markets have experienced increased
volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity, and heightened
uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen, or spread.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency

exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to
attempt to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be
considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using
derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when
the market prices, interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves
behave in a way not anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can
increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in illiquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a price
reflective of their value at times when the Trust believes it is desirable to
do so and the market price of illiquid securities is generally more volatile
than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to
value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict
the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage
creates significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or
capital appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage
will not be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely
affect the return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust may invest in insurance-linked securities (ILS). The return of
principal and the payment of interest on ILS are contingent on the
non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an
earthquake of a specific magnitude.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.

Call 1-800-710-0935 or visit www.amundipioneer.com/us for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
offered. There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of
closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock
exchange and frequently trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is
total assets less total liabilities, which include preferred shares, or
borrowings, as applicable, divided by the number of shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends
are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases
under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The
index does not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Trust's investments.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels below.

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
          similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks,
          etc.). See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own assumptions
          in determining fair value of investments). See Notes to Financial
          Statements -- Note 1A.

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of May 31, 2019, in valuing

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The
investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income
and the Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital
to the extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
Amundi and Amundi's wholly owned subsidiary, Amundi USA, Inc., serves as the
Trust's investment adviser (the "Adviser"). Amundi Pioneer Distributor, Inc.,
an affiliate of Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., serves as the Trust's
distributor (the "Distributor").

In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") released a
Disclosure Update and Simplification Final Rule. The Final Rule amends
Regulation S-X disclosures requirements to conform them to U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") for investment companies. The
Trust's financial statements were prepared in compliance with the new
amendments to Regulation S-X.

The Trust is an investment company and follows investment company accounting
and reporting guidance under U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires the management of
the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income,
expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements:

A.    Security Valuation

      The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
      New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open, as of the close of regular
      trading on the NYSE.

      Fixed-income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
      pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
      events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
      maturities and

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19 47

<PAGE>

      ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value methods or
      techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or instrument. A
      pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the basis of
      current market prices for other debt securities, historical trading
      patterns in the market for fixed-income securities and/or other factors.
      Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be valued at
      the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing service.
      When independent third party pricing services are unable to supply prices,
      or when prices or market quotations are considered to be unreliable, the
      value of that security may be determined using quotations from one or more
      broker-dealers.

      Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
      Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
      prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing
      Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
      information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the
      price information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be
      obtained from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable
      price quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing
      service, broker quotes will be solicited.

      Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
      obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other
      insurance-linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized
      reinsurance and industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price
      obtained from an independent pricing service, or through a third party
      using a pricing matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair
      value methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the
      instrument.

      Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
      last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
      securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities
      for which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the
      mean between the last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked
      prices are not available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid
      and asked prices are provided by independent third party pricing services.
      In the case of equity securities not traded on an exchange, prices are
      typically determined by independent third party pricing services using a
      variety of techniques and methods.

      The value of foreign securities is translated into U.S. dollars based on
      foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party
      pricing source. Trading in non-U.S. equity securities is substantially
      completed each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The
      values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
      Trust's shares are determined as of such times. The Trust may use a fair
      value model developed by an independent pricing service to value non-U.S.
      equity securities.

      Swap contracts, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
      centrally cleared swap contracts) are valued at the dealer quotations
      obtained from reputable International Swap Dealers Association members.
      Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
      by the central clearing counterparty.

      Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
      mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Shares of
      exchange-listed closed-end funds are valued by using the last sale price
      on the principal exchange where they are traded.

      Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services or
      broker-dealers are unable to supply prices or for which market prices
      and/or quotations are not readily available or are considered to be
      unreliable are valued by a fair valuation team comprised of certain
      personnel of the Adviser pursuant to procedures adopted by the Trust's
      Board of Trustees. The Adviser's fair valuation team uses fair value
      methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees. The
      Adviser's fair valuation team is responsible for monitoring developments
      that may impact fair valued securities and for discussing and assessing
      fair values on an ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the
      Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

      Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
      include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
      market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
      methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after
      the close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior
      to the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a
      significant event might include political or economic news, corporate
      restructurings, natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts.
      Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ significantly
      from exchange prices, and such differences could be material.

      At May 31, 2019, three securities were valued using fair value methods (in
      addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
      services, broker-dealers or using a third party insurance pricing model)
      representing 0.28% of net assets. The value of these fair valued
      securities was $840,278.

B.    Investment Income and Transactions

      Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
      dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
      passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
      data in the exercise of reasonable diligence.

      Interest income, including interest on income-bearing cash accounts, is
      recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend and interest income are reported
      net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country
      rates and net of income accrued on defaulted securities.

      Interest and dividend income payable by delivery of additional shares is
      reclassified as PIK (payment-in-kind) income upon receipt and is included
      in interest and dividend income, respectively.

      All discounts/premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are
      accreted/amortized for financial reporting purposes over the life of the
      respective securities, and such accretion/amortization is included in
      interest income.

      Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
      sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
      financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.    Foreign Currency Translation

      The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
      denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
      current exchange rates.

      Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
      represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on
      foreign currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the
      difference between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars
      actually received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency
      exchange rates on investments are not segregated on the Statement of
      Operations from the effects of changes in the market prices of those
      securities, but are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or
      loss on investments.

D.    Federal Income Taxes

      It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
      Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
      distribute all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains,
      if any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no provision for federal income
      taxes is required. As of November 30, 2018, the Trust did not accrue any
      interest or penalties with respect to uncertain tax positions, which, if
      applicable, would be

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19

<PAGE>

      recorded as an income tax expense on the Statement of Operations. Tax
      returns filed within the prior three years remain subject to examination
      by federal and state tax authorities.

      The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
      shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
      which may differ from U.S. GAAP. Distributions in excess of net investment
      income or net realized gains are temporary over distributions for
      financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
      or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and
      tax purposes. Capital accounts within the financial statements are
      adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but
      are not adjusted for temporary differences.

      The tax character of current year distributions payable will be determined
      at the end of the current taxable year. The tax character of distributions
      paid during the year ended November 30, 2018 was as follows:

      The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized depreciation is
      attributable to the tax treatment of premium and amortization, adjustments
      relating to catastrophe bonds, the tax adjustments relating to credit
      default swaps and partnerships.

E.    Risks

      At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries or industry
      sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more
      susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or
      other risks affecting those industries and sectors. The Trust's
      investments in foreign markets and countries with limited developing
      markets may subject the Trust

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19 51

<PAGE>

      to a greater degree of risk than investments in a developed market. These
      risks include disruptive political or economic conditions and the
      imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency exchange restrictions.

      The value of securities held by the Trust may go up or down, sometimes
      rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real
      or perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions,
      inflation, changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond
      markets or adverse investor sentiment. In the past several years,
      financial markets have experienced increased volatility, depressed
      valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty. These
      conditions may continue, recur, worsen or spread. A general rise in
      interest rates could adversely affect the price and liquidity of fixed
      income securities.

      The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities,
      floating rate loans and insurance-linked securities. The Trust may invest
      in securities and other obligations of any credit quality, including those
      that are rated below investment grade, or are unrated but are determined
      by the Adviser to be of equivalent credit quality. Below investment grade
      securities are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered
      speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and
      repay principal. Below investment grade securities, including floating
      rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price
      volatility, and may be less liquid and more difficult to value, especially
      during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt
      securities.

      Certain securities in which the Trust invests, including floating rate
      loans, once sold, may not settle for an extended period (for example,
      several weeks or even longer). The Trust will not receive its sale
      proceeds until that time, which may constrain the Trust's ability to meet
      its obligations. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in
      default or that are in bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if any,
      securing a floating rate loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet
      the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to liquidate. No active
      trading market may exist for many floating rate loans, and many loans are
      subject to restrictions on resale. Any secondary market may be subject to
      irregular trading activity and extended settlement periods. There is less
      readily available, reliable information about most floating rate loans
      than is the case for many other types of securities. Normally, the Adviser
      will seek to avoid receiving material, non-public information about the
      issuer of a loan either held by, or considered for investment by, the
      Trust, and this decision could adversely affect the Trust's investment
      performance. Loans may not be considered "securities," and purchasers,
      such as the Trust, therefore may not be entitled to rely on the anti-fraud
      protections afforded by federal securities laws. The Trust's investments
      in certain foreign markets or countries with limited developing markets
      may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19

<PAGE>

      than in a developed market. These risks include disruptive political or
      economic conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental
      laws or currency exchange restrictions.

      The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
      invested in illiquid securities. Illiquid securities are securities that
      the Trust reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current
      market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the sale or
      disposition significantly changing the market value of the securities.

      With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct
      business, the Trust is susceptible to operational, information security
      and related risks. While the Trust's Adviser has established business
      continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent,
      limit or mitigate, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in
      such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have
      not been identified. Furthermore, the Trust cannot control the
      cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the
      Trust such as Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Trust's custodian and
      accounting agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company ("AST"), the
      Trust's transfer agent. In addition, many beneficial owners of Trust
      shares hold them through accounts at broker-dealers, retirement platforms
      and other financial market participants over which neither the Trust nor
      Amundi Pioneer exercises control. Each of these may in turn rely on
      service providers to them, which are also subject to the risk of
      cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity failures or breaches at Amundi Pioneer or the
      Trust's service providers or intermediaries have the ability to cause
      disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in
      financial losses, interference with the Trust's ability to calculate its
      net asset value, impediments to trading, the inability of Trust
      shareowners to effect share purchases or receive distributions, loss of or
      unauthorized access to private shareowner information and violations of
      applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties,
      reputational damage, or additional compliance cost. Such costs and losses
      may not be covered under any insurance. In addition, maintaining vigilance
      against cyber-attacks may involve substantial costs over time, and system
      enhancements may themselves be subject to cyber-attacks.

F.    Insurance-Linked Securities ("ILS")

      The Trust invests in ILS. The Trust could lose a portion or all of the
      principal it has invested in an ILS, and the right to additional interest
      or dividend payments with respect to the security, upon the occurrence of
      one or more trigger events, as defined within the terms of an
      insurance-linked security. Trigger events, generally, are hurricanes,
      earthquakes, or other natural events of a specific size or magnitude that
      occur in a designated geographic region during a specified time period,
      and/or that involve losses or other metrics

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19 53

<PAGE>

      that exceed a specific amount. There is no way to accurately predict
      whether a trigger event will occur and, accordingly, ILS carry significant
      risk. The Trust is entitled to receive principal, and interest and/or
      dividend payments so long as no trigger event occurs of the description
      and magnitude specified by the instrument. In addition to the specified
      trigger events, ILS may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not
      limited to issuer (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional
      interpretations and adverse tax consequences.

      The Trust's investments in ILS may include event-linked bonds. ILS also
      may include special purpose vehicles ("SPVs") or similar instruments
      structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented
      business, known as quota share instruments (sometimes referred to as
      reinsurance sidecars), or to provide reinsurance relating to specific
      risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a collateralized
      instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured reinsurance
      investments also may include industry loss warranties ("ILWs"). A
      traditional ILW takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract, but
      there are also products that take the form of derivatives, collateralized
      structures, or exchange-traded instruments.

      Where the ILS are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance
      contracts, the Trust has limited transparency into the individual
      underlying contracts, and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and
      sound underwriting practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it may be more
      difficult for the Adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of
      the Trust's structured reinsurance investments, and therefore the Trust's
      assets are placed at greater risk of loss than if the Adviser had more
      complete information. Structured reinsurance instruments generally will be
      considered illiquid securities by the Trust. These securities may be
      difficult to purchase, sell or unwind. Illiquid securities also may be
      difficult to value. If the Trust is forced to sell an illiquid asset, the
      Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

G.    Credit Default Swap Contracts

      A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
      seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event or an underlying
      reference obligation, which may be a single security or a basket or index
      of securities. The Trust may buy or sell credit default swap contracts to
      seek to increase the Trust's income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of
      default on portfolio securities. A credit default swap index is used to
      hedge risk or take a position on a basket of credit entities or indices.

      As a seller of protection, the Trust would be required to pay the notional
      (or other agreed-upon) value of the referenced debt obligation to the
      counterparty in the event of a default by a U.S. or foreign corporate
      issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely result in a loss to the
      Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the counterparty a periodic
      stream of payments

54 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19

<PAGE>

      during the term of the contract, provided that no event of default
      occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to the seller would be the notional
      value of the credit default swaps outstanding. If no default occurs, the
      Trust would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment
      obligation. The Trust may also buy credit default swap contracts in order
      to hedge against the risk of default of debt securities, in which case the
      Trust would function as the counterparty referenced above.

      As a buyer of protection, the Trust makes an upfront or periodic payment
      to the protection seller in exchange for the right to receive a contingent
      payment. An upfront payment made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is
      recorded within the "Swap contracts, at value" line item on the Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by the Trust
      are recorded as realized gains or losses on the Statement of Operations.

      Credit default swap contracts are marked-to-market daily using valuations
      supplied by independent sources, and the change in value, if any, is
      recorded within the "Swap contracts, at value" line item on the Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a
      credit event or upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of
      the appropriate amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses
      on the Statement of Operations.

      Credit default swap contracts involving the sale of protection may involve
      greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
      instrument directly. Credit default swap contracts are subject to general
      market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
      Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
      investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
      the value of the referenced debt instrument received by the Trust,
      together with the periodic payments received, may be less than the amount
      the Trust pays to the protection buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.
      In addition, obligations under sell protection credit default swaps may be
      partially offset by net amounts received from settlement of buy protection
      credit default swaps entered into by the Trust for the same reference
      obligation with the same counterparty.

      Certain swap contracts that are cleared through a central clearinghouse
      are referred to as centrally cleared swaps. All payments made or received
      by the Trust are pursuant to a centrally cleared swap contract with the
      central clearing party rather than the original counterparty. Upon
      entering into a centrally cleared swap contract, the Trust is required to
      make an initial margin deposit, either in cash or in securities. The daily
      change in value on open centrally cleared contracts is recorded as
      "Variation margin for centrally cleared swaps" on the Statement of Assets
      and Liabilities. Cash received from or paid to the broker related to
      previous margin movement is held in a segregated account at the broker and
      is recorded as either "Due from broker

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19 55

<PAGE>

      for swaps" or "Due to broker for swaps" on the Statement of Assets and
      Liabilities. The amount of cash deposited with a broker as collateral at
      May 31, 2019, is recorded as "Swaps collateral" on the Statement of Assets
      and Liabilities.

      The average market value of credit default swap contracts open during the
      six months ended May 31, 2019, was $198,440. Open credit default swap
      contracts at May 31, 2019, are listed in the Schedule of Investments.

H.    Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

      All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
      automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
      "Plan"), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
      distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
      the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
      Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
      capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is
      completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
      penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent
      for shareowners in administering the Plan (the "Plan Agent"), in writing
      prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or
      resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
      dividend or other distribution.

      If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
      other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate
      in the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not
      offer the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of
      record. A firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in
      shares of the Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

      Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
      participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
      the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
      authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
      on the NYSE or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the
      net asset value per share is equal to or less than the market price per
      share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market premium), the Plan
      Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares. The number
      of newly issued shares to be credited to each account will be determined
      by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per
      share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum
      discount from the then current market price per share on the date of
      issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the
      net asset value per share is greater than the market value (market
      discount), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares
      acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage

56 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/19

<PAGE>

      charges with respect to newly issued shares. However, each participant
      will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect
      to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does
      not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may
      be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan
      shares in a brokerage account may be able to transfer the shares to
      another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

The Adviser manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the
Trust's Advisory Agreement with the Adviser are calculated daily at the annual
rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets"
means (a) the total assets of the Trust, including any form of investment
leverage, minus (b) all accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of
operations, which shall not include any liabilities or obligations attributable
to investment leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type
(including, without limitation, borrowing through a credit facility or the
issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other
similar preference securities, and/or (iii) any other means. For the six months
ended May 31, 2019 the net management fee was 0.70% (annualized) of the Trust's
average daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.03% (annualized) of the
Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under the management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs, including accounting, regulatory reporting and insurance
premiums, are paid by the Trust as administrative reimbursements. Included in
"Due to affiliates" reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities is
$16,468 in management fees, administrative costs and certain other
reimbursements payable to the Adviser at May 31, 2019.

3. Transfer Agent

AST serves as the transfer agent with respect to the Trust's common shares. The
Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust
and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.

4. Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Trust's use of derivatives may enhance or mitigate the Trust's exposure to
the following risks:

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Amudi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc, the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

<PAGE>

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
