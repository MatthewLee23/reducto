          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                               SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT
                                NOVEMBER 30, 2004

Dear Shareholders:

The First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund")
commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 27, 2004, under the
ticker symbol FCT. In our last correspondence back in July, given that the Fund
had just begun to ramp up its investment portfolio, we focused our brief
discussion on the fact that the Federal Reserve had just raised its target for
the Federal Funds Rate from 1.00% to 1.25%. As we now know, the Fed was just
getting started. We would like to add some comments regarding the U.S. economic
expansion to the discussion this time around.

For the period May 31, 2004 through November 30, 2004, which marked the midway
point of the Fund's fiscal year, the Fund's market price and net asset value
("NAV") performance diverged. During its first six months, the Fund posted a
market share price total return of -6.0% while the Fund's NAV total return was
up 2.5%. The Fund began paying its monthly dividend of $0.0883 per share in
August. In December, we were pleased to announce that in January the Fund's
monthly dividend would be increased 5.0% to $0.0927 per share. In the press
release announcing the increase, we commented that based on the Fund's closing
market share price of $18.00 on December 17, the $0.0927 dividend would equate
to an annualized distribution rate of 6.18%. We believe this yield to be
attractive in this economic climate relative to other senior loan closed-end
funds as well as many fixed-rate securities in general. Investors should know
that FCT is a pure play on senior floating-rate loans; the Fund does not own,
and is prohibited by its prospectus from purchasing, any high yield or
fixed-rate corporate bonds that often exhibit high price volatility.

The economic climate that we speak of is one of a sustained expansion
accompanied by measured rate increases from historically low interest rate
levels. The U.S. economy posted an upwardly revised 4.0% gross domestic product
growth rate in the third quarter, despite high energy prices and the war in
Iraq, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of economic expansion dating back to
the fourth quarter of 2001. This expansion coupled with a healthy stream of new
job creation, a weak dollar, and large deficits, in our opinion, has motivated
the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy on five separate occasions since
mid-2004, pushing the Fed Funds Target Rate from 1.00% to 2.25%. In general, a
rising rate climate normally translates into a higher level of income generated
by senior loans - but normally with a lag of 45 to 90 days to allow for
portfolio resets. However, strong investor inflows into the senior loan asset
class during calendar 2004, while having driven loan prices higher, have
narrowed credit spreads. The impact of these events on FCT was twofold: first,
some (but not all) of the anticipated increase in income normally associated
with rising short-term interest rates was offset by the lower spreads, and
second, NAV performance was helped by the price appreciation of the portfolio's
loans. This was especially true for more actively managed funds, such as FCT.

The strong economic base, in our opinion, is constructive for the senior loan
asset class in that default rates tend to decline below their long-term moving
averages when corporate revenues and profits are characterized as strong. As of
November 30, 2004, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index default rate stood at
1.15%, well below long-term averages.

In closing, in our opinion, the decline in the market share price of the Fund
which began in late summer is not a reflection of the performance of the
underlying portfolio, which has performed quite well, but rather is primarily a
reflection of temporary supply/demand imbalances brought on by the heavy
issuance of other new senior loan funds subsequent to the launch of FCT in May,
and secondarily, the short-term trading biases of some investors that were
especially prevalent prior to year-end.

Please see the following page for a graphical depiction of the Fund's portfolio.
The detailed holdings are shown on the Portfolio of Investments schedule.

We appreciate your continued confidence in our Fund.

Sincerely,
/S/JAMES A. BOWEN

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004 and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The
Fund will pursue these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets. The NAV is determined
as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"),
normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting
the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. The Fund
calculates NAV per common share by subtracting the Fund's liabilities and
liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred Shares from the Fund's Managed
Assets and dividing the result by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value, or in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value in
accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. A
majority of the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by
third parties. In the event that market quotations are not readily available,
the pricing service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the
valuations are deemed unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the
principal markets for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign
securities), but before the Fund values its assets, would materially affect net
asset value, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value
method in good faith to value the Fund's securities and investments. The use of
fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by
the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940
Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day of which
such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities trading on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as
of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities trading on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having substantially
grown in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less liquidity
than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior Loans have
few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a specific
Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly,
determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent
and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans than
for other types of securities. Typically Senior Loans are valued using
information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing

                                                                         Page 15

service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior Loan or
such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior Loan at a
fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by the Fund's
Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligations, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.


CASH FLOW INFORMATION:

The Fund issues its shares, invests in securities, and distributes dividends
from net investment income (which are either paid in cash or reinvested at the
discretion of shareholders). These activities are reported in the Statement of
Changes in Net Assets. Information on cash receipts and disbursements is
presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. Accounting practices that do not
affect reporting activities on a cash basis include unrealized gain or loss on
investment securities, and accretion/amortization of discount/premium
recognized on investment securities.


SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income is not accrued
until settlement date. The Fund instructs the custodian to segregate assets of
the Fund with a current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued
purchase commitments.

Amendment fees are compensation for evaluating and accepting changes to credit
agreements. Commitment fees are compensation received on undrawn amounts under a
revolving credit agreement. Facility fees are received on a facility's entire
committed amount, regardless of usage. Delayed compensation fees are received
for delays of settlement of interest income.


UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. These commitments are disclosed in the accompanying
Portfolio of Investments and Statement of Assets and Liabilities.


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)


INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

COMMON SHARE ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING COSTS:

Organization costs consist of costs incurred to establish the Fund and enable it
to legally do business. These costs include filing fees, legal services
pertaining to the organization of the business and audit fees relating to the
initial registration and auditing the initial seed capital statement, among
other fees. Offering costs consist of legal fees pertaining to the Fund's shares
offered for sale, registration fees, underwriting fees, and printing of initial
prospectus, among other fees. First Trust and Four Corners Capital Management,
LLC ("Four Corners") have paid all organizational expenses and all offering
costs of the Fund (other than sales load) that exceed $0.04 per Common Share.
The Fund's share of Common Share offering costs, $920,000, were recorded as a
reduction of the proceeds from the sale of Common Shares at May 31, 2004.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For its
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid dividends on any
outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-adviser and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives a portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
out of the First Trust management fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

Effective June 7, 2004, the Trustees of the Fund approved a revised compensation
plan. Under the revised plan, the Fund pays each Trustee who is not an officer
or employee of First Trust or any of its affiliates an annual retainer of
$10,000 which includes compensation for all regular quarterly board meetings and
regular committee meetings. No additional meeting fees are paid in connection
with regular quarterly board meetings or regular committee meetings. Additional
fees of $1,000 and $500 are paid to non-interested Trustees for special board
meetings and non-regular committee meetings, respectively. These additional fees
are shared by the funds in the First Trust fund complex that participate in the
particular meeting and are not per fund fees. Trustees are also reimbursed for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Trustees
adopted the revised plan because the increase in the number of funds in the
First Trust complex had the effect of rapidly increasing their compensation
under the previous arrangements. Prior to June 7, 2004, the Fund paid each
Trustee who was not an officer or employee of First Trust or any of its
affiliates $10,000 per annum plus $1,000 per regularly scheduled meeting
attended, $500 per committee meeting attended and reimbursement for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2004, aggregated
amounts were $1,501,733,743 and $875,869,727, respectively.



                                                                         Page 17

</TABLE>


                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. On November 30, 2004, 4,000 Auction
Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares") were issued and outstanding. [Offering
Costs of $299,751 and commissions of $1,000,000, paid directly to Lehman
Brothers, were charged to capital of Common Shares at November 30, 2004, upon
issuance of AMP Shares.]

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the AMP Shares is generally held every 7 and 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

As of November 30, 2004, 4,000 of the AMP Shares were outstanding at an annual
dividend rate of 2.05% and 2.20% for the 7 and 28 day auctions, respectively.
The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary
with short-term interest rates. These rates may vary in a manner not related
directly to the income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
Common Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets to common stock) in the accompanying financial
statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund has entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility among the Fund,
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, which provides for a
revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") to be used as leverage for the
Fund. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund,
where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total

assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Revolving Credit
Facility is $195,000,000. For the six months ended November 30, 2004, the
average amount outstanding was $85,513,661 with a weighted average interest rate
of 1.73%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which includes an
administration fee of 0.02%, a program fee of 0.20% and a liquidity fee of
0.14%.

                                 8. SENIOR LOANS

Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory and/or
optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions and
because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to prepay,
prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a result, the
actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's portfolio may be
substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Senior Loans generally have
maturities that range from five to eight years; however, the Fund estimates that
refinancings and prepayments result in an average maturity of the Senior Loans
held in it's portfolio of generally between 18-36 months.

Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates, which
are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered by
one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United States banks
or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are generally considered
to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is contractually obligated to
receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or Borrower prior to the disposition of
a Senior Loan.

               9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SHAREHOLDERS

On November 22, 2004, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0883 per share which

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect to receive cash distributions,
all dividends, including any capital gain distributions, on your Common Shares
will be automatically reinvested by PFPC (the "Plan Agent") in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC,
as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

   (1) If the Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value at the time
       of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal to the
       greater of (i) net asset value per Common Share on that date or (ii) 95%
       of the market price on that date.

   (2) If the Common Shares are trading below net asset value at the time of
       valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in
       cash and will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
       elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market
       price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has
       completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share
       paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of
       valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend
       or distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The
       Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions received in cash to
       purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of the valuation
       date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is
       necessary to comply with federal securities laws. Interest will not be
       paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Plan
Agent, or by telephone in accordance with such reasonable requirements as the
Plan Agent and Fund may agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated,
you will receive a certificate for each whole share in your account under the
Plan and you will receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your
account. If you wish, the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the
proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment
of the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service
charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to
amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.
Additional information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc.,
301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.
