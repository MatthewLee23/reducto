                Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2010
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of
arbitrage strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund includes allocations to event arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage
managers. Event arbitrage managers seek to identify mispricings in securities
that will be resolved through an anticipated event. Events can include mergers,
acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations and bankruptcy (either entering into
bankruptcy or emerging from it). Skills required include the ability to analyze
the relative value of the securities involved and the probability of the event
taking place in a timely manner. Fixed income arbitrage managers seek to
identify discrepancies in the prices of securities that are very closely related
and arbitrage that discrepancy.

For the year ended January 31, 2010, the Fund had a total return of 21.29%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2010, the Fund had an average annualized total return of
4.21%.

Arbitrage strategies had a banner year as the extreme dislocations of 2008 began
to subside. All arbitrage strategies saw strong performance but the categories
we expected would perform the best, convertible and fixed income arbitrage, saw
the highest returns. Fortunately, once the dust from 2008 had settled and it was
apparent which firms would survive, we were able to capitalize on our view by
tactically overweighting the convertible arbitrage strategy, a move that
enhanced returns for the Fund.

Our convertible arbitrage allocation was the most profitable sector within the
portfolio as a confluence of factors benefited our managers. In particular,
portfolios benefited from a rebound in implied volatilities, which had fallen to
near-zero levels during the crisis. In addition, continued high realized
volatility gave managers ample opportunity to generate additional returns from
gamma trading the portfolio.

Fixed income managers also realized their best returns in a decade as extreme
dislocations began to normalize. The most significant contributor to returns was
the normalization of the negative basis between cash bonds and derivative
instruments (credit default swaps). Other trades benefited from the narrowing of
sovereign swap spreads and normalization of certain yield curve abnormalities.

Our multi-strategy event managers realized substantial profits from tactically
overweighting credit investments coming into 2009. Most of their gains were
concentrated in North America and Europe, as investment grade and high yield
debt rallied dramatically. Many of these securities were issued by high quality
companies yet traded at historically wide spreads due to the financial crisis.

            Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2010
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund")
allocates its assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety
of distressed investment strategies while seeking to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes.

The Fund allocates to investment managers that buy the securities (generally
bonds and bank loans) of companies that are in bankruptcy or in danger of
bankruptcy. These managers are able to buy these securities at a discount to
their eventual value because traditional fixed income portfolio managers who
bought the bonds or banks that made the loans may not want to or be able to own
them once they are in default. The sellers may also not have the expertise and
patience to go through a lengthy restructuring process. Distressed investing
involves credit analysis, legal expertise and (often) negotiating ability, as
the portfolio manager must estimate the value of the claims he is buying, the
likely timing and resolution of the bankruptcy process and also may be called
upon to reach agreements with other claimants in order to speed the process.

For the year ended January 31, 2010, the Fund had a total return of 22.03%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2010, the Fund had an average annualized total return of
9.96%.

For the credit markets, 2009 saw the reversal of 2008's flight to quality. High
yield bonds and loans were among the best performing asset classes, with the
bond index returning 55.8%. All of our distressed managers generated positive
results, and nearly all of them realized a twelve-month return above 20%. These
returns are more impressive considering the fact that they were achieved while
still employing significant hedging. In general, our managers did not try to
catch the beta wave in low-rated companies, but rather focused on a handful of
situations that afforded significant upside with downside limited by hard assets
and/or legal processes.

Due to improved new issuance conditions, as well as a modest calendar of credit
maturities this year (just $50 billion), the default rate is projected to
decline to just 4% by the end of 2010. Despite these expectations, we still view
the distressed investing strategy as one of the best risk/reward opportunities
currently available. While the official default rate may decline, the amount of
existing distressed paper created during 2009 should present high return
opportunities for some time to come. In addition, much of the refinancing of the
past year has merely kicked the can down the road for weak and/or overleveraged
companies, trading some breathing room for higher financing costs. In total,
$855 billion of high yield bonds and loans will come due from 2012-2014. This
should set up a rich multi-year opportunity set as many of these companies will
need to restructure.

                  Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2010
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
long-biased portfolios of stocks, usually based on bottom-up equity research.
These portfolios generally vary from 20% to 40% net long.

For the year ended January 31, 2010, the Fund had a total return of 3.57%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2010, the Fund had an average annualized total return of
4.94%.

Our long/short managers produced mixed results over the twelve-month period.
During the sell-off leading up to March, our managers' stock selection was
rewarded as equity markets differentiated between strong companies and weak
ones. Gains from stock selection were much harder to come by following the March
9th rally, however, as lower quality names outperformed. The environment proved
to be a "trader's market", in which stock price momentum and beta were the most
important determinants of returns, not company-specific fundamentals. This made
for a challenging environment for our managers, as many gravitated towards
franchise companies with attractive valuations rather than lower quality
companies that will need to double margins in 2010 to meet earnings estimates.

In general, our sector-focused managers outperformed our generalist managers, as
they benefited from long exposures to the technology, financial, and energy
sectors, while also adding alpha through stock selection. A theme that worked
very well for our financial sector-focused manager was long investments in
larger banks and brokerages that had the benefit of government support, paired
with shorts in weaker, regional banks with commercial and industrial loan
exposures. Our energy/industrials-focused manager also outperformed due to long
positions in many beaten down oil exploration and production companies.

Offsetting these gains, managers' short portfolios uniformly lost money during
the period. Particularly notable losers included shorts in the consumer
discretionary sector as well as many financial names. While our managers were
often correct in identifying companies with deteriorating operating performance,
the market chose to give these companies the benefit of the doubt, looking
through near-term disappointment and believing that they could return to past
profitability.

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2010
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of opportunistic
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
smaller-sized, more idiosyncratic portfolios employing directional strategies or
focusing on particular markets or sectors.

For the year ended January 31, 2010, the Fund had a total return of 2.64%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on August 1, 2005
through January 31, 2010, the Fund had an average annualized total return of
1.58%.

Performance among the Fund's managers was solid, with each manager, except one
described below, realizing double-digit returns for the period. The Fund's
energy long/short manager saw the strongest returns, benefiting from rising oil
prices and a bounce back in demand for many oil services companies. Trailing
this manager only slightly was one of the Fund's long/short managers focused on
Asia, who realized strong gains from positions in Japan, Hong Kong and India.

The Fund's performance over the period was negatively impacted by a manager that
was long high quality names while shorting low quality companies throughout the
year. Accordingly, this manager exhibited a significant negative beta during the
market rally. We believed that this was an attractive trade when the position
was initiated and we remain convinced that this strategy has an attractive
return potential. However, because we want to maintain a moderately net positive
beta for the Fund overall, the target allocation for this manager is now lower.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Managers and Members of the Aetos Capital Funds:

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations, changes
in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC, and Aetos
Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Funds") at January 31, 2010, the results
of each of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the changes
in each of their members' capital for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for the periods presented, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Funds' management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of the underlying portfolio funds at January
31, 2010, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by
Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed
Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC
and Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC valued at $488,738,107 (96.61% of the
Fund's members' capital), $401,585,040 (94.54% of the Fund's members' capital),
$722,649,396 (92.54% of the Fund's members' capital), and $117,217,015 (84.90%
of the Fund's members' capital) respectively, at January 31, 2010, the values of
which have been estimated by the investment Manager, under general supervision
of the Board of Managers, in the absence of readily ascertainable market values.
Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have
been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the difference
could be material.

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                January 31, 2010

1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, and the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC
(collectively the "Funds" and individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of
Delaware as limited liability companies. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment companies. Each of the Funds is a
fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital appreciation by allocating their assets
among a select group of private investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds)
("Portfolio Funds") that utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies
specific for each Fund to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the
Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of January 31,
2010 the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 79%, 84%, 83%, and 90% for the Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy
Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Cayman
Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, and Aetos Capital
Opportunities Cayman Fund, respectively, and 1%, 1%, 1%, and less than 1% for
the Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Cayman II Fund, Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Cayman II Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Cayman II Fund and Aetos Capital Opportunities Cayman II Fund,
respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 105, GENERALLY ACCEPTED
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ("ASC 105") (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 168, ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION AND HIERARCHY OF
GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES: A REPLACEMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO.
162). ASC 105 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
("Codification") as the single source of authoritative accounting principles
recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"). ASC 105 is effective for interim and annual
periods ending after September 15, 2009. All existing accounting standards
documents are superseded as described in ASC 105, and all other accounting
literature not included in ASC 105 is non-authoritative. Updates to the
Codification Standards are issued as Accounting Standard Updates ("ASU"s) by the
FASB. In these financial statements, a dual presentation of the Codification and
the former reference has been adopted. The adoption of the Codification does not
impact the Funds' financial statements except for references made to
authoritative accounting literature in the footnotes.

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds and any restrictions on or illiquidity of the
interests in the Portfolio Funds, in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current market exchange and the differences
could be material to the financial statements. The use of different factors or
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value.

The FASB issued ASC Topic 820, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES,
(formerly SFAS No. 157 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS), which establishes a fair value
hierarchy and specifies that a valuation technique used to measure fair value
shall maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).
Accordingly the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations
based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon
unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3). The levels
of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35-39 to 55 are as
follows:

     -    Level 1 - Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active
          markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the
          Funds have the ability to access at the measurement date;

     -    Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
          asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in
          markets that are not considered to be active;

     -    Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable;

Inputs broadly refer to assumptions that market participants use to make
valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. ASC Topic 820-10-35-59
permits the Investment Manager to estimate the fair value of the investments in
the Portfolio Funds at the net asset value reported by the Portfolio Funds if

the net asset value is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement
principles of ASC Topic 946, FINANCIAL SERVICES - INVESTMENT COMPANIES. The
Investment Manager evaluates each Portfolio Fund individually to determine that
its net asset value is calculated in a manner consistent with ASC 946. The
Investment Manager also considers whether an adjustment to the net asset value
reported by the Portfolio Fund is necessary based upon various factors,
including, but not limited to, the attributes of the interest in the Portfolio
Fund held, including the rights and obligations, and any restrictions on or
illiquidity of such interests, and the fair value of such Portfolio Fund's
investment portfolio or other assets and liabilities. The Investment Manager
also considers such factors in determining whether a Portfolio Fund should be
classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents information about the level within the fair value
hierarchy at which the Funds' investments are measured as of January 31, 2010:

</TABLE>

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. Fund Income and Expenses (continued)

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant.

Such withholdings are listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in
Members' Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts
to which they apply.

E. Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.

F. Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents is defined as cash on deposit at financial
institutions, investments in money market funds, and highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Each Fund invests its cash in
the SEI Daily Income Trust Government Fund, a money market fund managed by an
affiliate of the Administrator. These holdings are included in the cash and cash
equivalents balance on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The cost of the
money market funds held at January 31, 2010 equals fair value.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Program fee may also include an annual performance-based incentive fee
outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for each Cayman feeder fund.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act received an annual retainer of $35,500 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $3,625 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee received an additional annual
retainer of $2,500. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. FUND MERGER

On November 1, 2008, Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC was
reorganized into Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC. The value of
the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Fund, LLC on November 1, 2008 was $46,535,603,
which was comprised of $40,692,369 of an investment in a Portfolio Fund,
$5,952,897 of cash, $682,234 of receivable for sale of investments, $9,688 of
interest receivable, $546,873 of redemptions of interests payable, and $254,712
of expenses payable.

6. RISK FACTORS

Limitations on the Funds' ability to withdraw their assets from Portfolio Funds
may limit the Funds' ability to repurchase their Interests. For example, many
Portfolio Funds impose lock-up periods prior to allowing withdrawals, which can
be two years or longer. After expiration of the lock-up period, withdrawals
typically are permitted only on a limited basis, such as monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually. Many Portfolio Funds may also indefinitely suspend
redemptions or establish restrictions on the ability to fully receive proceeds
from redemptions through the application of a redemption restriction or "gate."
In instances where the primary source of funds to repurchase Interests will be
withdrawals from Portfolio Funds, the application of these lock-ups and
withdrawal limitations may significantly limit the Funds' ability to repurchase
their Interests.

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques that may
involve significant risks. Such risks include those related to the volatility of
the equity, credit, and currency markets, the use of leverage associated with
certain fixed income strategies, derivative contracts and in connection with
short positions, the potential illiquidity of certain instruments and
counterparty and broker arrangements.

The Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific
sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater investment
return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic,
political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market,
positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Portfolio
Fund's net asset value.

<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

6. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

The Portfolio Funds may invest in securities of foreign companies that involve
special risks and considerations not typically associated with investments in
the United States of America, due to concentrated investments in a limited
number of countries or regions, which may vary throughout the year depending on
the Portfolio Fund. Such concentrations may subject the Portfolio Funds to
additional risks resulting from political or economic conditions in such
countries or regions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
currency exchange restrictions could cause the securities and their markets to
be less liquid and their prices to be more volatile than those of comparable
U.S. securities.

The Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk. Various risks are also associated with an investment
in the Funds, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the
Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to limited
liquidity of the Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

8. INVESTMENTS

As of January 31, 2010, collectively the Funds had investments in forty-one
Portfolio Funds, none of which were related parties. The following table lists
the Funds' investments in Portfolio Funds as of January 31, 2010. The agreements
related to investments in Portfolio Funds provide for compensation to the
general partners/managers in the form of management fees of 1.0% to 2.0% (per
annum) of the net assets and incentive fees or allocations of 10% to 20% of net
profits earned. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with
lock-up provisions ranging from 3 months to 3 years from initial investment. The
liquidity provisions shown in the table apply after any applicable lock-up
provisions.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                       AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC
                               PROXY VOTING POLICY

I.   INTRODUCTION

     This policy sets forth Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("AAM") policies
     and procedures for voting proxies with respect to portfolio securities held
     in the accounts for which AAM provides discretionary investment management
     services and for which AAM has the explicit authority to vote their
     proxies. The policy will be reviewed and, if necessary, updated
     periodically to address new or revised proxy voting issues as they arise.

     As an investment manager for various clients, including clients governed by
     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
     AAM may vote proxies as part of its authority to manage, acquire and
     dispose of client account assets, unless the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA
     account has explicitly reserved the authority for itself, or in the case of
     an account not governed by ERISA, the

<PAGE>

     client investment management agreement does not provide that AAM will vote
     proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, AAM will make voting
     decisions solely in the best interests of its clients and its ERISA plan
     clients and beneficiaries and participants, considering all relevant
     factors and without undue influence from individuals or groups who may have
     an economic interest in the outcome of a proxy vote. In fulfilling its
     obligations to its clients, AAM will act in a manner it deems prudent and
     diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the
     underlying portfolio securities held in its clients' accounts.

II.  ROUTINE CORPORATE MATTERS

     AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management on
     matters which are common management-sponsored initiatives, provided that,
     in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives will not detract from the
     economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client accounts.
     These matters are set out below:

     (i)  Appointment or election of auditors;

     (ii) Routine elections or re-elections of directors;

     (iii) Director's liability and indemnification;

     (iv) General updating/corrective amendments to charter;

     (v)  Name changes;

     (vi) Elimination of cumulative voting; and

     (vii) Elimination of preemptive rights.

III. ISSUES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT

     A.   AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management
          initiatives which may have a substantive financial or best interest
          impact, provided that, in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives
          will not detract from the economic value of the company's securities
          held in AAM client accounts. These matters are set out below:

          (i)   Capitalization changes which eliminate other classes of stock
                and voting rights;

          (ii)  Changes in capitalization authorization for stock splits, stock
                dividends, and other specified needs which are no more than 50%
                of the existing authorization;

          (iii) Stock purchase plans with an exercise price of not less than 85%
                of fair market value;

          (iv)  Stock option plans that are incentive based and not excessive;

          (v)   Other stock-based plans which are appropriately structured;

          (vi)  Reductions in supermajority vote requirements; and

          (vii) Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions.

     B.   AAM will generally not vote in support of management on certain issues
          which have a potential substantive financial or best interest impact
          when AAM believes that approval of the proposal may negatively impact
          the economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
          accounts. These matters are set out below:

          (i)    Capitalization changes which add classes of stock which are
                 blank check in nature or that dilute the voting interests of
                 existing shareholders;

          (ii)   Changes in capitalization authorization where management does
                 not offer an appropriate rationale or that are contrary to the
                 best interest of existing shareholders;

          (iii)  Anti-takeover and related provisions which serve to prevent the
                 majority of shareholders from exercising their rights or
                 effectively deter appropriate tender offers and other offers;

          (iv)   Amendments to by-laws which would require supermajority
                 shareholder votes to pass or repeal certain provisions;

          (v)    Classified boards of directors;

          (vi)   Reincorporation into a state which has more stringent
                 anti-takeover and related provisions;

<PAGE>

          (vii)  Shareholder rights plans which allow appropriate offers to
                 shareholders to be blocked by the board or trigger provisions
                 which prevent legitimate offers from proceeding;

          (viii) Excessive compensation or non-salary compensation related
                 proposals;

          (ix)   Change-in-control provisions in non-salary compensation plans,
                 employment contracts and severance agreements that benefit
                 management and would be costly to shareholders if triggered;
                 and

          (x)    "Other business as properly comes before the meeting" proposals
                 which give a blank check to those acting as proxy.

IV.  SOCIAL AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES

     AAM, believing that management's job is to handle ordinary business
     matters, and not wanting to arbitrarily impose a judgment on such matters,
     usually votes with management on these proposals. Third party analyses of
     these issues are taken into account. If an issue will, in our view
     negatively impact the investment merits of a company, we will oppose it.

V.   CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

     Situations may arise where there are material conflicts between AAM's
     interest and those of its advisory clients. AAM may resolve potential
     conflicts by using any of the following methods: (1) adopting a policy of
     disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent before
     voting: (2) basing the proxy vote on pre-determined voting guidelines if
     the application of the guidelines to the matter do not involve the exercise
     of discretion on the part of AAM; or (3) using the recommendations of an
     independent third party.

VI.  PROXY VOTING RECORD RETENTION

     AAM retains the following records: (1) proxy voting policies and
     procedures; (2) proxy statements; (3) records of votes cast on behalf of
     clients; (4) records of clients' requests for proxy voting information; and
     (5) any documents prepared by or on behalf of AAM that were material in
     making decisions on how to vote. AAM retains the above-mentioned records
     for a minimum of five years.

VII. PROXY ADMINISTRATION

     AAM's internal Proxy Committee (the "Committee") develops the firm's
     positions on all major corporate issues, creates guidelines, and oversees
     the voting process. The Committee, comprised of the Chief Investment
     Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel, analyzes types of
     proposals based on whether they would adversely affect shareholder's
     interests and make a company less attractive to own. In evaluating proxy
     proposals each year, the Committee relies upon our own knowledge of each
     company and its management, independent research provided by third parties,
     and information presented by company managements and shareholder groups.

     Once the Committee establishes its recommendations, they are distributed to
     AAM's Portfolio Management Group as voting guidelines. Ultimately, the
     investment professional primarily accountable for a portfolio is
     responsible for votes on companies in that portfolio. Most vote consistent
     with AAM's guidelines. Occasionally, some will take an independent view on
     certain issues and vote differently. When an investment professional casts
     votes which are counter to the Committee's guidelines, they are required to
     document their reasons in writing for the Committee. Annually, the Board of
     Managers of the AAM Funds will review AAM's proxy voting process, policies,
     and voting records.

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Investment Manager manages multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition to the Funds, these other accounts may include separate accounts,
collective trusts, or offshore funds. The Investment Manager manages potential
conflicts between funds or with other types of accounts through allocation
policies and procedures, internal review processes, and oversight by directors
and independent third parties. The Investment Manager has developed trade
allocation procedures and controls to ensure that no one client, regardless of
type, is intentionally favored at the expense of another. Allocation policies
are designed to address potential conflicts in situations where two or more
funds or accounts participate in investment decisions involving the same
securities.

(a)(3)

DESCRIPTION OF COMPENSATION

Professionals employed by the Investment Manager are subject to a compensation
structure that includes base salary and a discretionary bonus. Bonuses are
variable and depend on many factors, including firm, business unit and

<PAGE>

individual performance relative to established benchmarks and criteria.
Individuals that consistently exceed performance objectives are eligible for
promotions and/or equity participation in the firm. Officers are also eligible
to share in the net profits of the business under a profit participation plan.
Participation amounts are determined on the basis of performance and
contribution. In addition, all managing directors of the Investment Manager have
a common equity membership in Aetos Capital, LLC.

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR COVERED OFFICERS OF
       INVESTMENT COMPANIES ADVISED BY AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC

The Board of Managers of each registered investment company listed on Schedule A
hereto (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") has adopted the following
Code of Ethics (the "Code") applicable to its President and Treasurer ("Covered
Officers") of Funds advised by Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("Aetos") to
ensure the continuing integrity of financial reporting and transactions. The
Covered Officers covered by the Code are listed on Schedule B hereto.

I.       SEPARATE CODE

This Code is the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of
Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Insofar as any other code of
ethics previously adopted by Aetos sets forth the fundamental principles and key
policies and procedures that govern the conduct of all of Aetos' employees,
including the Covered Officers, such prior code of ethics is superceded by this
Code to the extent that such principles, policies and procedures conflict with
the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and Aetos' codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act")
are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this Code. In addition to this Code or any other code of ethics
previously adopted by Aetos, the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") and rules promulgated thereunder
contain many specific provisions designed to protect the Funds from conflicts of
interest and overreaching. Any conduct by Covered Officers required by specific
Investment Company Act or Advisers Act provisions or the rules thereunder is
presumed to be in compliance with this Code. Each Covered Officer is accountable
for his or her adherence to this Code and Aetos' policies. Any violation of this
Code by a Covered Officer may result in disciplinary action, including immediate
dismissal.

II.      REQUIREMENTS

All Covered Officers must:

         1.       Engage in and promote honest and ethical conduct, including
                  the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of
                  interest between personal and professional relationships;

         2.       Act responsibly in producing and produce, full, fair,
                  accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and
                  documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other
                  public communications made by the Funds;

         3.       Comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and
                  regulations;

         4.       Promptly report suspected material violations of this Code,
                  including violations of securities laws or other laws, rules
                  and regulations applicable to the Funds, to Aetos' General
                  Counsel and the Audit Committee; and

         5.       Promote accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer must act with integrity, including being honest and candid
while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law
or Aetos' policies, and place the interests of the Funds before the Covered
Officer's own personal interests.


<PAGE>

Each Covered Officer is required to familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements applicable to each Fund and must not knowingly misrepresent or fail
to disclose, or cause others to misrepresent or fail to disclose, material facts
about a Fund to others, including, but not limited to, officers and counsel to
Aetos and the Funds, and their respective independent managers, independent
auditors and governmental regulators. Each Covered Officer should, to the extent
appropriate within his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
employees of the Funds and Aetos with the goal of promoting full, fair,
accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made
by the Funds.

It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the
standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

III.     AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS

The overarching principle of this Code is that the personal interests of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interests of the
Funds. As a result, each Covered Officer must: (i) handle any actual or apparent
conflict of interest in an ethical manner; (ii) not use his or her personal
influence or personal relationships to influence investment decisions or
financial reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund; (iii) not
cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the personal benefit of
the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of such Fund; and (iv) not use
material non-public knowledge pertaining to a Fund.

IV.      COMPLIANCE AND ANNUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Each Fund will follow certain procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) all violations and
potential violations will be reported to the General Counsel of Aetos; (ii) the
General Counsel of Aetos will take all appropriate action to investigate any
potential violations; (iii) if the General Counsel of Aetos determines that a
violation has occurred, he or she will take all appropriate disciplinary or
preventive action and inform the Board of Managers of the Fund of his or her
decision; and (iv) all changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR or otherwise as provided by SEC rules.

Each Covered Officer is required: (i) upon receipt of the Code, to sign and
submit to the General Counsel an acknowledgment stating that he or she has
received, read and understands the Code; (ii) annually thereafter to submit a
statement to the General Counsel confirming that he or she has received, read
and understands the Code and has complied with the requirements of the Code;
(iii) not to retaliate against any employee subordinate to the Covered Officer
for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith; and (iv) to
notify the General Counsel of Aetos, as appropriate, if the Covered Officer
observes any irregularities or violations of this Code.

V.       AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

Except with respect to Schedules A and B hereto, which may be updated at any
time, this Code may be amended only by the Board of Managers of each Fund at a
meeting of the Board of Managers duly called for that purpose. Waivers, as
defined in Form N-CSR, from this Code may be granted only by the Board of
Managers of each affected Fund at a meeting of the Board of Managers duly called
for that purpose.
