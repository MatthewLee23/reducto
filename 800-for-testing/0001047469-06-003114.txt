LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                                February 1, 2006

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the net asset value (NAV) of The Chile
Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") increased by 12.91%, vs. an increase of 20.90% for the
Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile Index.(1) These figures are after
adjusting for two dividend payments, which in the period had a unusually large
impact on the NAV. On September 16, 2005, the Fund paid a dividend of US$1.26
per share to shareholders, and on January 6, 2006, the Fund paid a dividend of
US$3.08 per share. This dividend went ex-dividend on December 19, 2005. This
means that over the course of 2005, the Fund paid dividends totaling
approximately 28% of the total size of the Fund at the start of the period.

The market price of the Fund's shares rose 26.16% during the year, closing at
US$17.65. As a result, the Fund's shares went from a 10.8% discount to NAV to a
24.6% premium to NAV.

THE CHILEAN ECONOMY CONTINUES TO PERFORM WELL

The Chilean economy continues to go from strength to strength in many respects,
even after many years of impressive performance. 2005 was no exception. Economic
activity surprised to the upside throughout the year, driven not just by the
strength of commodity prices, but more importantly by domestic demand. We
believe that economic growth will probably finish the year in excess of 6%.
Unemployment fell to 6.9%, the lowest level since 1997. Retail sales were
robust, as was credit growth. Foreign trade was strong, boosted by the price of
copper, which reached all time highs. The country's trade surplus was US$9.24
billion at the end of the year, above the US$9.02 billion surplus in 2004.
Behind this number is impressive growth not only in exports but also imports.
The government continued to run a tight ship fiscally, running a budget surplus
equivalent to 4.8% of GDP.

The only cause for mild concern in our mind has been inflation, which began to
pick up in late 2004. Chile's Central Bank started a tightening cycle in
September 2004, and has raised interest rates very gradually since then from a
low of 1.75% to 4.25% as of December 31, 2005. Headline inflation has fallen to
4.0%, at the top of its target range, although core inflation remains subdued.
The Central Bank continues to describe monetary conditions as expansive, so we
expect that the tightening cycle is not over, even though we do not expect
significant further increases.

The currency has been buoyed by strong trade flows. The Chilean Peso finished
the year at Ch$512 to the US Dollar, 7.8% stronger in nominal terms than the
rate at the end of 2004. A significant portion of the Fund's returns in 2005,
therefore, came from currency appreciation.

We start 2006 with a new Government in power. Michelle Bachelet, a Socialist
representing the ruling CONCERTACION coalition of Centrist and Left wing
parties, won a fourth consecutive election victory for the CONCERTACION on
January 15, 2006. Market consensus is that the new government represents
continuity with an outgoing administration which was highly regarded, both
internally and externally. We are more cautious and believe that we might see
the new President pushing a more aggressive Socialist agenda. We are
particularly concerned about plans to reform the Pension Fund system in Chile.
We were encouraged however by her choice of Cabinet, in particular by the choice
of the well known Harvard economist, Andres Velasco, as the new Minister of
Finance.

EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS SUPPORTIVE

The global environment was broadly favorable for emerging markets. Ample
liquidity conditions as a result of low global interest rates, robust global
growth and high investor appetite for higher-return and higher-risk assets drove
outperformance versus developed markets for the year as a whole, notwithstanding
a mid-period downturn. Ironically, this meant that, in a regional context, Chile
underperformed the higher beta markets such as Brazil and Argentina.

Unlike other stock markets in Latin America, the size of Chile's domestic
capital markets means that the equity market is relatively indifferent to
foreign portfolio flows. Foreign investor interest in Chile is modest. 2005 was
an unusual year in that, for the first time in many years, the main driver was
domestic retail flows rather than flows from the pension fund administrators,
who for much of the year were bumping up against their statutory maximums for
exposure to equities. This led to excellent liquidity conditions for most of the
year, as well as a continuation of equity capital markets activity. This changed
in the third quarter of the year, when an increase in the rate of CPI inflation
was the trigger for outflows from the mutual fund system. This led to a
relatively weak fourth quarter.

PORTFOLIO

In terms of the portfolio, this was a difficult market environment for the Fund
in relative terms. This was a year when, on balance, the most liquid companies
with the largest market capitalization outperformed less liquid companies. The
diversification requirements imposed on the Fund by the United States Internal
Revenue Code limit the Fund's overall exposure to the companies with the largest
market capitalization and force us to be underweight companies with the largest
representation in the benchmark indices. This has hurt returns.

Sector allocation was marginally positive to relative performance. Our
overweight in Consumer Discretionary and our underweight in Industrials and
Telecommunications Services paid off. On the negative side, our overweight in
Consumer Staples and underweight in Utilities detracted from returns.

At the stock level, our positions in Comercial Siglo XXI (2.4% of the Fund as of
December 31, 2005), which owns a department store (La Polar), Empresa Nacional
de Electricidad (17.5%) and non-benchmark Laboratorios Andromaco (0.5%)
contributed strongly. Our underweight in Lan Airlines (1.4%) and Madeco also
contributed. On the negative side our overweight in Compania Cervecerias Unidas
(4.5%) and our underweight in Enersis (4.3%) hurt returns.

OUTLOOK

Looking ahead, our views on Chile and its stock market remains generally
positive. The economy made significant progress in 2005, and we think it has the
potential to generate similar growth in 2006, driven primarily by continuing
strong domestic consumption.

The risks we believe are mostly external: in particular, commodity prices which
have already remained stronger for longer than many had predicted, will be key.
As an export driven economy, Chile is sensitive to global growth and as a
Pacific-facing country, trade with Asia and the emerging China also remains
important.

The main internal risk is political, we believe. The market is likely to be
sensitive to any signs of directional change from the new Government and, in
particular, any reforms that might threaten the stability of domestic capital
markets.

Ironically, equity valuations, which in the case of Chile have seldom been
placed on the positive side of the ledger, are now looking quite attractive. For
the first time in many years, Chilean equities, based on certain measures and
within

                                        2
<Page>

certain sectors, are looking cheaper than comparable companies in Mexico. We
expect foreign investment flows to be more of a factor in 2006 than they were in
2005.

For our part, we will continue to look for reasonably valued companies we think
can deliver consistent earnings growth. We believe that in 2006, companies that
trade at cheaper valuations are likely to be more highly prized than they were
in 2005. From a sector perspective, we continue to be overweight in consumer
areas such as beverages and specific retail stocks, as we think the consumer
could be a key driver of Chile's economy over the next several years.

Respectfully,

/s/ Matthew J.K. Hickman                /s/ Steven B. Plump

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A. ORGANIZATION

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

NOTE B. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. The Fund's equity
investments are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the
closing price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily
traded at the time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are
reported, equity investments are generally valued at the most recent bid
quotation as of the Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of
a short sale of securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater
than 60 days are valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing
service, which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes
into consideration market indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments.
Debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of
amortized cost, which approximates market value, unless it is determined that
this method would not represent fair value. Investments in mutual funds are
valued at the mutual fund's closing net asset value per share on the day of
valuation.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available, or whose values have been materially affected by events occurring
before the Fund's Valuation Time, but after the close of the securities' primary
market, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the
direction of, the Board of Directors under procedures established by the Board
of Directors. The Fund may utilize a service provided by an independent third
party which has been approved by the Board of Directors to fair value certain
securities. At December 31, 2005, the Fund held 2.60% of its net assets in a
security valued at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures
established by the Board of Directors with an aggregate cost of $4,296,118 and
fair value of $3,732,146. The Fund's estimate of fair value assumes a willing
buyer and a willing seller neither acting under a compulsion to buy or sell.
Although this security may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the
prices realized on such sales could differ from the price originally paid by the
Fund or the current carrying value, and the difference could be material.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term time
deposit available through Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Fund's custodian.
The short-term time deposit is a variable rate account classified as a
short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
U.S. income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify

                                       12
<Page>

as a regulated investment company and to make the requisite distributions to its
shareholders sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all U.S. income
and excise taxes.

The Fund accrues foreign taxes on realized gains and repatriation taxes in an
amount equal to what the Fund would owe if the securities were sold and the
proceeds repatriated on the valuation date as a liability and reduction of
realized/unrealized gains. Taxes on foreign income are recorded when the related
income is recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Fund incurred
$425,159 of such expense.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (I)  market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/depreciation in value of investments,
and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency
contracts, exchange gains or losses realized between the trade date and
settlement date on security transactions, and the difference between the amounts
of interest and dividends recorded on the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: The Fund invests in securities of foreign countries and governments which
involve certain risks in addition to those inherent in domestic investments.
Such risks generally include, among others, currency risk (fluctuations in
currency exchange rates), information risk (key information may be inaccurate

                                       13
<Page>

or unavailable) and political risk (expropriation, nationalization or the
imposition of capital or currency controls or punitive taxes). Other risks of
investing in foreign securities include liquidity and valuation risks.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in the emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by that fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected
to be illiquid, which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk
and may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any
liquid trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to
liquidate these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities.
Although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions,
the prices realized on such sales could be substantially less than those
originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying values and these difference
could be material. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded
may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements
applicable to companies whose securities are publicly traded.

in the form of shares purchased by the Fund's transfer agent in the open market.
Directors as a group own less than 1% of the Fund's outstanding shares.

NOTE D. CAPITAL STOCK

Funds rate plus 0.50%. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Fund had no
borrowings under the Credit Facility.

                                       15

NOTE G. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses
deferred due to wash sales, and Post-October losses (as defined below).

The tax character of dividends and distributions paid during the years ended
December 31 for the Fund were as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
      ORDINARY INCOME            LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS
- ---------------------------    ---------------------------
   2005           2004            2005           2004
- ------------   ------------    ------------   ------------
<S>            <C>             <C>            <C>
$  6,895,150   $  4,765,765    $ 37,112,129   $ 17,846,270
</Table>

Under current tax law, certain capital losses realized after October 31 within a
taxable year may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following tax year ("Post-October losses"). For the tax year ended December 31,
2005, the Fund incurred and elected to defer net realized foreign currency
losses of $18,104.

The tax basis of components of distributable earnings differ from the amounts
reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities by temporary book/tax
differences. These differences are primarily due to losses deferred on wash
sales and deferred Post-October losses.

At December 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
for the Fund were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                          <C>
Undistributed ordinary income                $   1,788,740
Accumulated net realized gain                      865,270
Unrealized appreciation                         59,918,903
                                             -------------
Total distributable earnings                 $  62,572,913
                                             =============
</Table>

At December 31, 2005, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, as
well as the gross unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from
investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value and the net
unrealized appreciation from investments were $111,560,444, $62,168,599,
$(2,166,453) and $60,002,146, respectively.

At December 31, 2005, the Fund reclassified $371,020 to accumulated net realized
gain on investments and foreign currency related transactions from undistributed
net investment income. Net assets were not affected by this reclassification.

NOTE H. CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Fund may provide general indemnifications
pursuant to certain contracts and organizational documents. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made
against the Fund and, therefore, cannot be estimated; however, based on
experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of The Chile Fund, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
at December 31, 2005, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the ten years in the period then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and issuers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

The Fund is required by Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, to advise its shareholders within 60 days of the Fund's year end
(December 31, 2005) as to the U.S. federal tax status of dividends and
distributions received by the Fund's shareholders in respect of such year. Of
the $4.34 per share distribution paid in respect of such year, $0.68 per share
was derived from net investment income and $3.66 per share was derived from net
realized long-term capital gains. The Fund has met the requirements to pass
through all ordinary income as qualified dividends as noted on Box 1B on Form
1099-DIV. Please note that to utilize the lower tax rate for qualifying dividend
income, shareholders must have held their shares in the Fund for at least 61
days during the 121 day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date.
There were no distributions which qualified for the dividend received deduction
available to corporate shareholders.

The Fund does not intend to make an election under Section 853 to pass through
foreign taxes paid by the Fund to its shareholders. This information is given to
meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV to determine the amount
includable on their respective tax returns for 2005.

Notification for calendar year 2005 was mailed in January 2006. The notification
along with Form 1099-DIV reflects the amount to be used by calendar year
taxpayers on their U.S. federal income tax returns.

Foreign shareholders will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the
amount of the actual ordinary dividends paid by the Fund. They will generally
not be entitled to foreign tax credit or deduction for the withholding taxes
paid by the Fund.

In general, distributions received by tax-exempt recipients (e.g., IRAs and
Keoghs) need not be reported as taxable income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. However, some retirement trusts (e.g., corporate, Keogh and 403(b)(7)
plans) may need this information for their annual information reporting.

Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the
tax consequences of their investment in the Fund.

DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED)

The InvestLink(SM) Program is sponsored and administered by Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., ("Computershare"), not by The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund").
Computershare will act as program administrator (the "Program Administrator") of
the InvestLink(SM) Program (the "Program"). The purpose of the Program is to
provide existing shareholders with a simple and convenient way to invest
additional funds and reinvest dividends in shares of the Fund's common stock
("Shares") at prevailing prices, with reduced brokerage commissions and fees.

In order to participate in the Program, you must be a registered holder of at
least one Share of stock of the Fund. Purchases of Shares with funds from a
participant's cash payment or automatic account deduction will begin on the next
day on which funds are invested. All cash payments must be drawn on a U.S. bank
and payable in U.S. dollars. Checks must be made payable to Computershare. If a
participant selects the dividend reinvestment option, automatic investment of
dividends generally will begin with the next dividend payable after the Program
Administrator receives his enrollment form. Once in the Program, a person will
remain a participant until he terminates his participation or sells all Shares
held in his Program account, or his account is terminated by the Program
Administrator. A participant may change his investment options at any time by
requesting a new enrollment form and returning it to the Program Administrator.

A participant will be assessed certain charges in connection with his
participation in the Program. All optional cash deposit investments will be
subject to a service charge. Sales processed through the Program will have a
service fee deducted from the net proceeds, after brokerage commissions. In
addition to the transaction charges outlined above, participants will be
assessed per share processing fees (which include brokerage commissions.)
Participants will not be charged any fee for reinvesting dividends.

The number of Shares to be purchased for a participant depends on the amount of
his dividends, cash payments or bank account or payroll deductions, less
applicable fees and commissions, and the purchase price of the Shares. The
investment date for cash payments is the 25th day of each month (or the next
trading day if the 25th is not a trading day). The investment date for dividend
reinvestment is the dividend payment date. The Program Administrator uses
dividends and funds of participants to purchase Shares of the Fund in the open
market. Such purchases will be made by participating brokers as agent for the
participants using normal cash settlement practices. All Shares purchased
through the Program will be allocated to participants as of the settlement date,
which is usually three business days from the purchase date. In all cases,
transaction processing will occur within 30 days of the receipt of funds, except
where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the Federal Securities laws or when unusual market
conditions make prudent investment impracticable. In the event the Program
Administrator is unable to purchase Shares within 30 days of the receipt of
funds, such funds will be returned to the participants.

The average price of all Shares purchased by the Program Administrator with all
funds received during the time period from two business days preceding any
investment date up to the second business day preceding the next investment date
shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in connection with the
Shares purchased for his account with his funds or dividends received by the
Program Administrator during such time period. The average price of all Shares
sold by the Program Administrator pursuant to sell orders received during such
time period shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in
connection with the Shares sold for his account pursuant to his sell orders
received by the Program Administrator during such time period. All sale requests
having an

                                       20
<Page>

anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are expected to be submitted in
written form. In addition, all sale requests received by the Program
Administrator within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be
submitted in written form.

Computershare, as Program Administrator, administers the Program for
participants, keeps records, sends statements of account to participants and
performs other duties relating to the Program. Each participant in the Program
will receive a statement of his account following each purchase of Shares. The
statements will also show the amount of dividends credited to such participant's
account (if applicable), as well as the fees paid by the participant. In
addition, each participant will receive copies of the Fund's annual and
semi-annual reports to shareholders, proxy statements and, if applicable,
dividend income information for tax reporting purposes.

If the Fund is paying dividends on the Shares, a participant will receive
dividends through the Program for all Shares held on the dividend record date on
the basis of full and fractional Shares held in his account, and for all other
Shares of the Fund registered in his name. The Program Administrator will send
checks to the participants for the amounts of their dividends that are not to be
automatically reinvested at no cost to the participants.

Shares of the Fund purchased under the Program will be registered in the name of
the accounts of the respective participants. Unless requested, the Fund will not
issue to participants certificates for Shares of the Fund purchased under the
Program. The Program Administrator will hold the Shares in book-entry form until
a Program participant chooses to withdraw his Shares or terminate his
participation in the Program. The number of Shares purchased for a participant's
account under the Program will be shown on his statement of account. This
feature protects against loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates.

A participant may withdraw all or a portion of the Shares from his Program
account by notifying the Program Administrator. After receipt of a participant's
request, the Program Administrator will issue to such participant certificates
for the whole Shares of the Fund so withdrawn or, if requested by the
participant, sell the Shares for him and send him the proceeds, less applicable
brokerage commissions, fees, and transfer taxes, if any. If a participant
withdraws all full and fractional Shares in his Program account, his
participation in the Program will be terminated by the Program Administrator. In
no case will certificates for fractional Shares be issued. The Program
Administrator will convert any fractional Shares held by a participant at the
time of his withdrawal to cash.

Participation in any rights offering, dividend distribution or stock split will
be based upon both the Shares of the Fund registered in participants' names and
the Shares (including fractional Shares) credited to participants' Program
accounts. Any stock dividend or Shares resulting from stock splits with respect
to Shares of the Fund, both full and fractional, which participants hold in
their Program accounts and with respect to all Shares registered in their names
will be automatically credited to their accounts.

All Shares of the Fund (including any fractional share) credited to his account
under the Program will be voted as the participant directs. The participants
will be sent the proxy materials for the annual meetings of shareholders. When a
participant returns an executed proxy, all of such Shares will be voted as
indicated. A participant may also elect to vote his Shares in person at the
Shareholders' meeting.

                                       21
<Page>

A participant will receive tax information annually for his personal records and
to help him prepare his U.S. federal income tax return. The automatic
reinvestment of dividends does not relieve him of any income tax which may be
payable on dividends. For further information as to tax consequences of
participation in the Program, participants should consult with their own tax
advisors.

The Program Administrator in administering the Program will not be liable for
any act done in good faith or for any good faith omission to act. However, the
Program Administrator will be liable for loss or damage due to error caused by
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Shares held in custody by the
Program Administrator are not subject to protection under the Securities
Investors Protection Act of 1970.

The participant should recognize that neither the Fund nor the Program
Administrator can provide any assurance of a profit or protection against loss
on any Shares purchased under the Program. A participant's investment in Shares
held in his Program account is no different than his investment in directly held
Shares in this regard. The participant bears the risk of loss and the benefits
of gain from market price changes with respect to all of his Shares. Neither the
Fund nor the Program Administrator can guarantee that Shares purchased under the
Program will, at any particular time, be worth more or less than their purchase
price. Each participant must make an independent investment decision based on
his own judgment and research.

While the Program Administrator hopes to continue the Program indefinitely, the
Program Administrator reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Program at
any time. It also reserves the right to make modifications to the Program.
Participants will be notified of any such suspension, termination or
modification in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program. The
Program Administrator also reserves the right to terminate any participant's
participation in the Program at any time. Any question of interpretation arising
under the Program will be determined in good faith by the Program Administrator
and any such good faith determination will be final.

Any interested shareholder may participate in the Program. All other cash
payments or bank account deductions must be at least $100.00, up to a maximum of
$100,000.00 annually. An interested shareholder may join the Program by reading
the Program description, completing and signing the enrollment form and
returning it to the Program Administrator. The enrollment form and information
relating to the Program (including the terms and conditions) may be obtained by
calling the Program Administrator at one of the following telephone numbers:
(800) 730-6001 (U.S. and Canada) or (781) 575-3100 (outside U.S. and Canada).
All correspondence regarding the Program should be directed to: Computershare
Trust Company, N.A., InvestLink(SM) Program, P.O. Box 43010, Providence,
RI 02940-3010.


InvestLink is a service mark of Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

ADVISORY AGREEMENT APPROVAL DISCLOSURE (UNAUDITED)

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")
contemplates that the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The Chile Fund, Inc.
(the "Fund"), including a majority of the Directors who have no direct or
indirect interest in the investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements and are
not "interested persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the
"Independent Directors"), are required to annually review and re-approve the
terms of the Fund's existing investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements and
approve any newly proposed terms therein. In this regard, the Board reviewed and
re-approved, during the most recent six months covered by this report: (i) an
investment advisory agreement with Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("Credit
Suisse") for the Fund, and (ii) a sub-advisory agreement with CELFIN CAPITAL
Servicios Financieros S.A. ("CELFIN" or the "Sub-Adviser") for the Fund. The
investment advisory agreement with Credit Suisse and the investment sub-advisory
agreement with CELFIN are collectively referred to as the "Advisory Agreements."

More specifically, at a meeting held on November 16-17, 2005, the Board,
including the Independent Directors advised by their independent legal counsel,
considered the factors and reached the conclusions described below relating to
the selection of Credit Suisse and the Sub-Adviser and the re-approval of the
Advisory Agreements.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

The Board received and considered various data and information regarding the
nature, extent and quality of services provided to the Fund by Credit Suisse and
the Sub-Adviser under the Advisory Agreements. The most recent investment
adviser registration forms ("Forms ADV") for Credit Suisse and the Sub-Adviser
were provided to the Board, as were responses of Credit Suisse and the
Sub-Adviser to a detailed series of requests submitted by the Independent
Directors' independent legal counsel on behalf of such Directors. The Board
reviewed and analyzed these materials, which included, among other things,
information about the background and experience of the senior management and the
expertise of, and amount of attention devoted to the Fund by, investment
personnel of Credit Suisse and the Sub-Adviser. In this regard, the Board
specifically reviewed the qualifications, backgrounds and responsibilities of
the individuals primarily responsible for day-to-day portfolio management
services for the Fund.

In addition, the Board received and reviewed information on Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and other regulatory inquiries and examinations
relating to the Fund, Credit Suisse and the Sub-Adviser. The Board considered
the investment and legal compliance programs of each of these entities,
including their implementation of enhanced compliance policies and procedures in
response to SEC rule changes and other regulatory initiatives. The Board also
considered the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer's report and recommendations.

The Board evaluated the ability of Credit Suisse and the Sub-Adviser, including
their respective resources, reputations and other attributes, to attract and
retain highly qualified investment professionals, including research, advisory,
and supervisory personnel. In this regard, the Board considered information
regarding Credit Suisse's compensation program for its personnel involved in the
management of the Fund, including incentive and retirement plans.

                                       27
<Page>

Based on the above factors, together with those referenced below, the Board
concluded that it was generally satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of
the investment advisory services provided to the Fund by Credit Suisse and the
Sub-Adviser.

FUND PERFORMANCE AND EXPENSES

The Board considered the performance results of the Fund over a number of years
and since the inception of the Fund, as well as for recent periods. It also
considered these results in comparison to the Fund's benchmark index, the MSCI
Chile Index. Additionally, the Board compared the Fund's performance to that of
another Chile fund. The Board noted that the Fund underperformed its benchmark
index in recent periods. The Board also noted that, although the Fund had
underperformed the other Chile fund in some periods, it had outperformed it in
recent periods. The Board considered, however, that diversification requirements
forced the Fund to be significantly underweighted in the largest and most liquid
companies in Chile relative to the MSCI Chile Index. Additionally, the Board
noted that Chilean pension fund shareholders have expressed their satisfaction
with the composition of the Fund.

The Board received and considered statistical information regarding the Fund's
total expense ratio and its various components, including management fees,
non-management fees, fee waivers/caps and/or expense reimbursements and actual
total expenses of the Fund (including and excluding investment-related expenses
and taxes). It also considered comparisons of these fees to those of a group of
funds that was determined to be the most similar to the Fund (the "Peer Group")
and of a broader universe of relevant funds (the "Universe"). Lipper Inc.
("Lipper"), an independent provider of investment company data, determined the
Peer Group and Universe for the Fund and provided the comparative data. The
Board was provided with a description of the methodology used by Lipper to
select the closed-end mutual funds in the Fund's Peer Group and Universe. The
Board observed that the Fund's total expense ratio was higher than the median
overall expense ratio of the Fund's Peer Group and Universe. The Board also
noted that the non-management expenses of the Fund were lower than the Fund's
Peer Group's median non-management expenses.

Based on the above-referenced considerations and other factors, the Board
concluded that the overall performance and expense results supported the
re-approval of the Advisory Agreements for the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SUB-ADVISORY FEE RATES

The Board reviewed and considered the proposed contractual investment advisory
fee rate (the "Advisory Agreement Rate") payable by the Fund to Credit Suisse
for investment advisory services. The Board also reviewed and considered the
proposed contractual investment sub-advisory fee rate (the "Sub-Advisory
Agreement Rate") payable by Credit Suisse to the Sub-Adviser for investment
sub-advisory services. The Board noted that Credit Suisse had voluntary fee
waivers in effect to base its current investment advisory fee upon the lower of
the average weekly stock price or its average weekly net assets.

Additionally, the Board received and considered information comparing the
Advisory Agreement Rate (both on a stand-alone basis and on a combined basis
with the Fund's administration fee rates) with those of the other funds in its
Peer Group. The Board noted that the combined rates of investment advisory and
administration fees for the

                                       28
<Page>

Fund were not appreciably higher than the median rates of its Peer Group. The
Board also noted that the Fund's administrator is not affiliated with Credit
Suisse and that the Fund's administration agreement and corresponding fees were
negotiated at arms-length. The Board concluded that the Advisory Agreement Rate
for the Fund was not appreciably higher that the median rates of the Fund's Peer
Group. The Board concluded that these and other factors supported the Advisory
Agreement Rate and approved the Advisory Agreement for the Fund.

The Board also reviewed the Sub-Advisory Agreement Rate charged by CELFIN, which
serves as Sub-Adviser to the Fund. The Board concluded that the Sub-Advisory
Agreement Rate was fair and equitable, based on its consideration of the factors
described above.

PROFITABILITY

The Board received and considered an estimated profitability analysis of Credit
Suisse based on the Advisory Agreement Rate, as well as on other relationships
between the Fund and Credit Suisse and its affiliates. The Board concluded that,
in light of the costs of providing investment management and other services to
the Fund, the profits and other ancillary benefits that Credit Suisse and its
affiliates received with regard to providing these services to the Fund were not
unreasonable.

The Board also received and considered an income statement related to the Fund
from the Sub-Adviser. The Board observed the costs of providing portfolio
management and other services to the Fund. The Board also noted that the
sub-advisory fees are paid to CELFIN by Credit Suisse and not directly by the
Fund, and that the Board separately determined that the Advisory Agreement Rate
for the Fund was fair and equitable. Based on these factors, the Board concluded
that the profits and other ancillary benefits that CELFIN and its affiliates
received with regard to providing these services to the Fund were not
unreasonable.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The Board received and considered information regarding whether there have been
economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund, whether the Fund
has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale, and whether there is
potential for realization of any further economies of scale. The Board concluded
that any actual or potential economies of scale are, or will be, shared fairly
with Fund shareholders, including most particularly through Advisory Agreement
Rate breakpoints.

INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES TO OTHER CLIENTS

The Board received and considered information about the nature and extent of
services and fee rates offered by Credit Suisse to other clients, including
other registered investment companies and institutional investors and investment
companies to which Credit Suisse serves as an unaffiliated sub-adviser. The
Board also received and considered information about the nature and extent of
services offered by the Sub-Adviser to other clients. The Board concluded that
the Advisory Agreement Rate and Sub-Advisory Agreement Rate were reasonable,
considering factors such as the nature and extent of services provided and
comparison with rates offered to other clients.

                                       29
<Page>

Where Credit Suisse's rates offered to its other clients were appreciably lower,
the Board considered that Credit Suisse's voluntary fee waivers would
potentially decrease the Advisory Agreement Rate. The Board concluded, based on
information provided by Credit Suisse, that the costs associated with managing
and operating a registered, closed-end, country fund, compared with other
clients or other funds, provided a justification for the higher fee rates
charged to the Fund.

OTHER BENEFITS TO CREDIT SUISSE

The Board received and considered information regarding potential "fall-out" or
ancillary benefits received by Credit Suisse and its affiliates as a result of
their relationship with the Fund. Such benefits could include, among others,
benefits directly attributable to the relationship of Credit Suisse with the
Fund (such as soft-dollar credits) and benefits potentially derived from an
increase in the business of Credit Suisse as a result of its relationship with
the Fund (such as the ability to market to shareholders other financial products
offered by Credit Suisse and its affiliates).

OTHER FACTORS AND BROADER REVIEW

As discussed above, the Board reviews detailed materials received from Credit
Suisse and the Sub-Adviser annually as part of the re-approval process under
Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act. The Board also reviews and assesses the quality
of the services that the Fund receives throughout the year. In this regard, the
Board reviews reports of Credit Suisse and the Sub-Adviser at least in each of
its quarterly meetings, which include, among other things, a detailed portfolio
review and detailed fund performance reports, and confers with the chief
investment officer and managers of the Fund at various times throughout the
year.

After considering the above-described factors and based on the deliberations and
its evaluation of the information provided to it, the Board concluded that
re-approval of the Advisory Agreements for the Fund was in the best interest of
the Fund and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board unanimously re-approved
the Advisory Agreements.

accounting firm to the registrant and (ii) all permissible non-audit services to
be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to Credit

non-audit services to the Chairperson of the Committee, and the Chairperson

Pre-approval by the Committee of any permissible non-audit services shall not be
required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit
services provided to the registrant, Credit Suisse and any Covered Services
Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by
the registrant to its independent registered public accounting firm during the
fiscal year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided; (ii) the
permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the registrant at the time
of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly
brought to the attention of the Committee and approved by the Committee (or its
delegate(s)) prior to the completion of the audit.

                        CREDIT SUISSE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS

                              CSAM CLOSED-END FUNDS

                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

Introduction

     Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("CSAM") is a fiduciary that owes each
     of its clients duties of care and loyalty with respect to proxy voting. The
     duty of care requires CSAM to monitor corporate events and to vote proxies.
     To satisfy its duty of loyalty, CSAM must cast proxy votes in the best
     interests of each of its clients.

     The Credit Suisse Funds, Credit Suisse Institutional Funds, and CSAM
     Closed-End Funds (the "Funds"), which have engaged Credit Suisse Asset
     Management, LLC as their investment adviser, are of the belief that the
     proxy voting process is a means of addressing corporate governance issues
     and encouraging corporate actions both of which can enhance shareholder
     value.

Policy

     The Proxy Voting Policy (the "Policy") set forth below is designed to
     ensure that proxies are voted in the best interests of CSAM's clients. The
     Policy addresses particular issues and gives a general indication of how
     CSAM will vote proxies. The Policy is not exhaustive and does not include
     all potential issues.

Proxy Voting Committee

     The Proxy Voting Committee will consist of a member of the Portfolio
     Management Department, a member of the Legal and Compliance Department, and
     a member of the Operations Department (or their designees). The purpose of
     the Proxy Voting Committee is to administer the voting of all clients'
     proxies in accordance with the Policy. The Proxy Voting Committee will
     review the Policy annually to ensure that it is designed to promote the
     best interests of CSAM's clients.

     For the reasons disclosed below under "Conflicts," the Proxy Voting
     Committee has engaged the services of an independent third party
     (initially, Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS")) to assist in issue
     analysis and vote recommendation for proxy proposals. Proxy proposals
     addressed by the Policy will be voted in accordance with the Policy. Proxy
     proposals addressed by the Policy that require a case-by-case analysis will
     be voted in accordance with the vote

<Page>

     recommendation of ISS. Proxy proposals not addressed by the Policy will
     also be voted in accordance with the vote recommendation of ISS. To the
     extent that the Proxy Voting Committee proposes to deviate from the Policy
     or the ISS vote recommendation, the Committee shall obtain client consent
     as described below.

     CSAM investment professionals may submit a written recommendation to the
     Proxy Voting Committee to vote in a manner inconsistent with the Policy
     and/or the recommendation of ISS. Such recommendation will set forth its
     basis and rationale. In addition, the investment professional must confirm
     in writing that he/she is not aware of any conflicts of interest concerning
     the proxy matter or provide a full and complete description of the
     conflict.

Conflicts

     CSAM is the institutional and mutual fund asset management arm of Credit
     Suisse First Boston, which is part of Credit Suisse Group, one of the
     world's largest financial organizations. As part of a global, full service
     investment-bank, broker-dealer, and asset-management organization, CSAM and
     its affiliates and personnel may have multiple advisory, transactional,
     financial, and other interests in securities, instruments, and companies
     that may be purchased or sold by CSAM for its clients' accounts. The
     interests of CSAM and/or its affiliates and personnel may conflict with the
     interests of CSAM's clients in connection with any proxy issue. In
     addition, CSAM may not be able to identify all of the conflicts of interest
     relating to any proxy matter.

Consent

     In each and every instance in which the Proxy Voting Committee favors
     voting in a manner that is inconsistent with the Policy or the vote
     recommendation of ISS (including proxy proposals addressed and not
     addressed by the Policy), it shall disclose to the client conflicts of
     interest information and obtain client consent to vote. Where the client is
     a Fund, disclosure shall be made to any one director who is not an
     "interested person," as that term is defined under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended, of the Fund.

Recordkeeping

CSAM is required to maintain in an easily accessible place for five years all
records relating to proxy voting.

     These records include the following:

     -    a copy of the Policy;

     -    a copy of each proxy statement received on behalf of CSAM clients;

<Page>

     -    a record of each vote cast on behalf of CSAM clients;

     -    a copy of all documents created by CSAM personnel that were material
          to making a decision on a vote or that memorializes the basis for the
          decision; and

     -    a copy of each written request by a client for information on how CSAM
          voted proxies, as well as a copy of any written response.

     CSAM reserves the right to maintain certain required proxy records with ISS
     in accordance with all applicable regulations.

     Disclosure

     CSAM will describe the Policy to each client. Upon request, CSAM will
     provide any client with a copy of the Policy. CSAM will also disclose to
     its clients how they can obtain information on their proxy votes.

     ISS will capture data necessary for Funds to file Form N-PX on an annual
     basis concerning their proxy voting record in accordance with applicable
     law.

     Procedures

     The Proxy Voting Committee will administer the voting of all client
     proxies. CSAM has engaged ISS as an independent third party proxy voting
     service to assist in the voting of client proxies. ISS will coordinate with
     each client's custodian to ensure that proxy materials reviewed by the
     custodians are processed in a timely fashion. ISS will provide CSAM with an
     analysis of proxy issues and a vote recommendation for proxy proposals. ISS
     will refer proxies to the Proxy Voting Committee for instructions when the
     application of the Policy is not clear. The Proxy Voting Committee will
     notify ISS of any changes to the Policy or deviating thereof.

          has a financial interest in or association with the company, and is
          therefore not independent; (2) fees for non-audit services are
          excessive, or (3) there is reason to believe that the independent
          auditor has rendered an opinion, which is neither accurate nor
          indicative of the company's financial position. Generally vote on a
          case-by-case basis on shareholder proposals asking companies to
          prohibit their auditors from engaging in non-audit services (or
          capping the level of non-audit services). Generally vote on a
          case-by-case basis on auditor rotation proposals taking into
          consideration: (1) tenure of audit firm; (2) establishment and
          disclosure of a renewal process whereby the auditor is regularly
          evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price; (3) length of
          the rotation period advocated in the proposal, and (4) significant

          board and committee meetings without a valid reason for the absences;

          by a majority of the shares outstanding; (5) have failed to act on

          their shares; (6) are inside directors or affiliated outside directors
          and sit on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee; (7) are
          inside directors or affiliated outside directors and the full board
          serves as the audit, compensation, or nominating committee or the
          company does not have one of these committees; or (8) are audit
          committee members and the non-audit fees paid to the auditor are

          basis.

          Proposals on director and officer indemnification and liability

          against proposals that would: (1) eliminate entirely directors' and
          officers' liability for monetary damages for violating the duty of
          care; or (2) expand coverage beyond just legal expenses to acts, such
          as negligence, that are more serious violations of fiduciary
          obligation than mere carelessness. Generally vote for only those
          proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a director's
          or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if: (1) the director was
          found to have acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably
          believed was in the best interests of the company, and (2) only if the
          director's legal expenses would be covered.

     Filling Vacancies/Removal of Directors

          Generally vote against proposals that provide that directors may be
          removed only for cause. Generally vote for proposals to restore

          designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
          members with clearly delineated duties; (2) 2/3 independent board; (3)

          consist of a majority or substantial majority (two-thirds) of
          independent directors unless the board composition already meets the
          adequate threshold. Generally vote for shareholder proposals requiring
          the board audit, compensation, and/or nominating committees be
          composed exclusively of independent directors if they currently do not
          meet that standard. Generally withhold votes from insiders and
          affiliated outsiders sitting on the audit, compensation, or nominating

          best suited to add value for shareholders. The major decision factors
          are: (1) company performance relative to its peers; (2) strategy of
          the incumbents versus the dissidents; (3) independence of
          directors/nominees; (4) experience and skills of board candidates; (5)

          provision for proxy contests as follows: In the case of a contested
          election, management should be permitted to request that the dissident
          group honor its confidential voting policy. If the dissidents agree,
          the policy may remain in place. If the dissidents will not agree, the

Potential Conflicts of Interest

                  It is possible that conflicts of interest may arise in
connection with the portfolio managers' management of the Portfolio's
investments on the one hand and the investments of other accounts on the other.
For example, the portfolio managers may have conflicts of interest in allocating
management time, resources and investment opportunities among the Portfolio and
other accounts they advise. In addition due to differences in the investment
strategies or restrictions between the Portfolio and the other accounts, the
portfolio managers may take action with respect to another account that differs
from the action taken with respect to the Portfolio. Credit Suisse has adopted
policies and procedures that are designed to minimize the effects of these
conflicts.

                  If Credit Suisse believes that the purchase or sale of a
security is in the best interest of more than one client, it may (but is not
obligated to) aggregate the orders to be sold or purchased to seek favorable
execution or lower brokerage commissions, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws

<Page>

and regulations. Credit Suisse may aggregate orders if all participating
client accounts benefit equally (i.e., all receive an average price of the
aggregated orders). In the event Credit Suisse aggregates an order for
participating accounts, the method of allocation will generally be determined
prior to the trade execution. Although no specific method of allocation of
transactions (as well as expenses incurred in the transactions) is expected to
be used, allocations will be designed to ensure that over time all clients
receive fair treatment consistent with Credit Suisse's fiduciary duty to its
clients (including its duty to seek to obtain best execution of client trades).
The accounts aggregated may include registered and unregistered investment
companies managed by Credit Suisse's affiliates and accounts in which Credit
Suisse's officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates own interests.
Applicant may not be able to aggregate securities transactions for clients who
direct the use of a particular broker-dealer, and the client also may not
benefit from any improved execution or lower commissions that may be available
for such transactions.

Compensation

                  Matthew Hickman is compensated for his services by Credit
Suisse. His compensation consists of a fixed base salary and a discretionary
bonus that is not tied by formula to the performance of any fund or account. The
factors taken into account in determining his bonus include the Fund's
performance, assets held in the Fund and other accounts managed by the portfolio
managers, business growth, team work, management, corporate citizenship, etc. A
portion of the bonus may be paid in phantom shares of Credit Suisse Group stock
as deferred compensation. Like all employees of Credit Suisse, these portfolio
managers participate in Credit Suisse's profit sharing and 401(k) plans.

Securities Ownership. As of December 31, 2005, Mr. Hickman did not own any
shares of the registrant.

                       CODE OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR OFFICERS

PREAMBLE

          Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 directs that rules be
adopted disclosing whether a company has a code of ethics for senior financial
officers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has adopted rules
requiring annual disclosure of an investment company's code of ethics applicable
to the company's principal executive as well as principal financial officers, if
such a code has been adopted. In response, the above Funds (each a "Fund", and
together the "Funds") have adopted this Code of Ethics.

STATEMENT OF POLICY

          It is the obligation of the senior officers of the Funds to provide
full, fair, timely and comprehensible disclosure--financial and otherwise--to
Fund shareholders, regulatory authorities and the general public. In fulfilling
that obligation, senior officers must act ethically, honestly and diligently.
This Code is intended to enunciate guidelines to be followed by persons who
serve the Funds in senior officerships. No Code can address every situation that
a senior officer might face; however, as a guiding principle, senior officers
should strive to implement the spirit as well as the

letter of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to provide the type of
clear and complete disclosure and information Fund shareholders have a right to
expect.

          The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to promote high standards of
ethical conduct by Covered Persons (as defined below) in their capacities as
officers of the Funds, to instruct them as to what is considered to be
inappropriate and unacceptable conduct or activities for officers and to
prohibit such conduct or activities. This Code supplements other policies that
the Funds and their adviser have adopted or may adopt in the future with which
Fund officers are also required to comply (e.g., code of ethics relating to
personal trading and conduct).

COVERED PERSONS

          This Code of Ethics applies to those persons appointed by the Fund's
Board of Directors as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, or persons performing similar functions.
It is recognized that each of such persons currently is a full-time employee of
Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC ("CSAM"), each Fund's investment adviser.

PROMOTION OF HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT

          In serving as an officer of the Funds, each Covered Person must
maintain high standards of honesty and ethical conduct and must encourage his
colleagues who provide services to the Funds, whether directly or indirectly, to
do the same.

          Each Covered Person understands that as an officer of a Fund, he has a
duty to act in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The
interests of other CSAM clients or CSAM itself or the Covered Person's personal
interests should not be allowed to compromise the Covered

<Page>

Person's fulfilling his duties as an officer of the Fund. The governing Boards
of the Funds recognize that the Covered Persons are also officers or employees
of CSAM. Furthermore, the governing Boards of the Funds recognize that, subject
to the Covered Person's fiduciary duties to the Funds, the Covered Persons will
in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Funds or for
CSAM, or for both) be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on CSAM and the Funds. The governing
Boards of the Funds recognize that the participation of the Covered Persons in
such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Funds
and CSAM and/or its affiliates, and is consistent with the expectation of the
governing Boards of the performance by the Covered Persons of their duties as
officers of the Funds.

          If a Covered Person believes that his responsibilities as an officer
or employee of CSAM are likely to materially compromise his objectivity or his
ability to perform the duties of his role as an officer of the Funds, he should
consult with CSAM's general counsel, the Funds' chief legal officer or outside
counsel, or counsel to the independent Directors/Trustees of the relevant Fund
or Funds. Under appropriate circumstances, a Covered Person should also consider
whether to present the matter to the Directors/Trustees of the relevant Fund or
Funds or a committee thereof.

          No Covered Person shall suggest that any person providing, or
soliciting to be retained to provide, services to a Fund give a gift or an
economic benefit of any kind to him in connection with the person's retention or
the provision of services.

PROMOTION OF FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE

          No Covered Person shall create or further the creation of false or
misleading information in any SEC filing or report to Fund shareholders. No
Covered Person shall conceal or fail

<Page>

to disclose information within the Covered Person's possession legally required
to be disclosed or necessary to make the disclosure made not misleading. If a
Covered Person shall become aware that information filed with the SEC or made
available to the public contains any false or misleading information or omits to
disclose necessary information, he shall promptly report it to CSAM's general
counsel or Fund counsel, who shall advise such Covered Person whether corrective
action is necessary or appropriate.

          Each Covered Person, consistent with his responsibilities, shall
exercise appropriate supervision over, and shall assist, relevant Fund service
providers in developing financial information and other disclosure that complies
with relevant law and presents information in a clear, comprehensible and
complete manner. Each Covered Person shall use his best efforts within his area
of expertise to assure that Fund reports reveal, rather than conceal, the
relevant Fund's financial condition.

          Each Covered Person shall seek to obtain additional resources if he
believes that available resources are inadequate to enable the Funds to provide
full, fair and accurate financial information and other disclosure to regulators
and Fund shareholders.

          Each Covered Person shall inquire of other Fund officers and service
providers, as appropriate, to assure that information provided is accurate and
complete and presented in an understandable format using comprehensible
language.

          Each Covered Person shall diligently perform his services to the
Funds, so that information can be gathered and assessed early enough to
facilitate timely filings and issuance of reports and required certifications.

<Page>

PROMOTION OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

          Each Covered Person shall become and remain knowledgeable concerning
the laws and regulations relating to the Funds and their operations and shall
act with competence and due care in serving as an officer of the Funds. Each
Covered Person with specific responsibility for financial statement disclosure
will become and remain knowledgeable concerning relevant auditing standards,
generally accepted accounting principles, FASB pronouncements and other
accounting and tax literature and developments.

          Each Covered Person shall devote sufficient time to fulfilling his
responsibilities to the Funds, recognizing that he will devote substantial time
to providing services to other CSAM clients and will perform other activities as
an employee of CSAM.

          Each Covered Person shall cooperate with a Fund's independent
auditors, regulatory agencies and internal auditors in their review or
inspection of the Fund and its operations.

          No Covered Person shall knowingly violate any law or regulation
relating to the Funds or their operations or seek to illegally circumvent any
such law or regulation.

          No Covered Person shall engage in any conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit or misrepresentation involving the Funds or their operations.

PROMOTING PROMPT INTERNAL REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS

          Each Covered Person shall promptly report his own violations of this
Code and violations by other Covered Persons of which he is aware to the
Chairman of the relevant Fund's Audit Committee.

<Page>

          Any requests for a waiver from or an amendment to this Code shall be
made to the Chairman of the relevant Fund's Audit Committee. All waivers and
amendments shall be disclosed as required by law.

SANCTIONS

          Failure to comply with this Code will subject the violator to
appropriate sanctions, which will vary based on the nature and severity of the
violation. Such sanctions may include censure, suspension or termination of
position as an officer of the Fund. Sanctions shall be imposed by the relevant
Fund's Audit Committee, subject to review by the entire Board of
Directors/Trustees of the Fund.

          Each Covered Person shall be required to certify annually whether he
has complied with this Code.

NO RIGHTS CREATED

          This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern the Funds' senior officers in the conduct of
the Funds' business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in any
employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or
entity.

RECORDKEEPING

          The Funds will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an
easily accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the
Board (1) that provided the basis for any amendment or

<Page>

waiver to this Code and (2) relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions
imposed for such violation, together with a written record of the approval or
action taken by the relevant Board.

AMENDMENTS

          The Directors/Trustees will make and approve such changes to this Code
of Ethics as they deem necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this Code.
