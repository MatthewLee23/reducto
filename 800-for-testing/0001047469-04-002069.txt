EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]

Thomas J. Fetter
President

Amid the market volatility and external political shocks of recent years, many
investors have become more concerned with risk management. That trend has been
especially true in the municipal bond market, where the use of bond insurance
has become increasingly common. Today, roughly half of all municipal bond
issuance is composed of insured bonds. As part of our continuing educational
series, we thought it might be helpful to discuss bond insurance and its impact
on the municipal market.

THE USE OF BOND INSURANCE HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS...

Municipal bond insurance was initially developed in 1971, when AMBAC Assurance
Corp., the nation's first municipal insurer, offered insurance as a way to
guarantee principal and interest payments on bond issues in the event of a bond
default. Over the following three decades, the municipal market has witnessed a
surge in the use of insurance. For example, in 1980, just 3% of all municipal
issuance was insured. However, by late 2003, that figure had risen to roughly
50%. Insurance has clear benefits for purchasers: the elimination of default
risk of the underlying issuer, AAA quality ratings and an enhancement of an
issue's liquidity. (It's important to note that, while insured bonds are insured
as to principal and interest payments, they still remain subject to interest
rate and market risks.)

THE MECHANICS OF MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE...

We start with the underlying reality that an issuer with a AAA credit rating
will pay less in interest expense than an issuer with a lower credit rating.
Thus, an issuer must first determine whether purchasing insurance is financially
feasible. That is, will the interest savings offset the cost of insurance? If
so, the issuer must then qualify for insurance. Just as an individual must
qualify for insurance, so must a bond issuer meet certain criteria. The issuer
provides key financial data and documents to potential insurers that are then
used to assess the issuer's financial strength and underlying fundamentals. If
the issuer qualifies, insurance is then effected by "direct purchase," with the
payment of a one-time premium by the issuer. The premium fee is calculated as a
percentage of the value of the bond issue - typically, around 50 basis points
(0.50%), but more if the credit entails higher risk. (An alternative method of
purchase involves "elective bidding," in which the insurance is purchased by
bond dealers, who determine at the time the bond is sold whether it is more
attractive as an insured or uninsured bond.)

IN-DEPTH CREDIT ANALYSIS INCLUDES INSURERS AS WELL AS BOND ISSUERS...

When analyzing municipal bonds, an investor naturally researches the issuer's
fundamentals. However, if the bond is insured, the analyst is concerned with the
soundness of the insurer as well. At Eaton Vance, analysis of the insured
segment is an integral part of our total municipal research effort. Research
includes, among other areas, analysis of an insurer's claims-paying ability, its
capital structure and the overall quality of its portfolio of policies. Based on
claims-paying ability, there are currently six bond insurers rated AAA by
Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch - the nation's leading
rating agencies.

INSURERS CAN PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN STRUCTURING BOND DEALS AND IMPROVING CREDIT
QUALITY...

Insurers play an important role in capital formation for municipal borrowers,
working closely with municipal officials to forge deals that raise capital for
vital projects at affordable interest rates. In so doing, the insurers can help
states and municipalities achieve more efficient fiscal management. Insurers
often re-structure bond deals by insisting on provisions that are intended to
make the deal more secure. That has proved a major benefit to investors in
recent years. In a more risk-conscious climate, we believe that an ongoing
analysis of the insured market is a necessary discipline to invest successfully
in today's municipal market.

                                                     Sincerely,

                                                     /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

                                                     Thomas J. Fetter

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
MARKET RECAP

The U.S. economy saw encouaging growth in the year ended November 30, 2003.
Consumer spending picked up, as tax cuts added to discretionary incomes. Capital
spending - which has been very slow to recover - rebounded somewhat, as
companies increased their investment in new technology and machinery. The equity
markets, which typically anticipate future economic trends, mounted a strong
rally.

SERVICE INDUSTRIES LED THE RECOVERY, WHILE MANUFACTURING IMPROVED SLIGHTLY...

The manufacturing sector showed signs of a modest revival during the period,
while service sectors such as health care, tourism and information technology
also gained ground. The residential real estate sector remained strong, although
the commercial segment continued to lag. Financial services gathered some
momentum due to increasing investor confidence and stronger equity markets.
Meanwhile, the retail sector benefited from tax cuts enacted earlier in the
year, which boosted consumer spending.

WITH INFLATION IN CHECK, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS KEPT INTEREST RATES LOW...

The nation's Gross Domestic Product grew 3.3% in the second quarter of 2003,
followed by a startling 8.2% rise in the third quarter. The data suggested that
an economy plagued by numerous false starts in the past year had finally gained
some traction. Typical of an early-stage recovery, however, the labor markets
were slow to rebound. The nation's unemployment rate was 5.9% in November 2003.
While job growth was generally disappointing, there were signs of incremental
hiring in some sectors, including temporary agencies, the financial services
sector and smaller companies. The building trades remained strong, as low
mortgage rates prompted brisk residential construction.

Inflation, meanwhile, has been modest. Prices for finished goods remained fairly
stable, although health care costs continued to rise and prices for
manufacturing inputs and commodities such as oil and natural gas remained high.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG, L.P.

generally under control, the Federal Reserve has maintained an accommodative
monetary policy, holding its Federal Funds rate - a key short-term interest rate
barometer - at 1.00%, where it has stood since June.

While signs of a more robust economy have driven a strong rally in the equity
markets, the bond markets have given up some of their gains of the past year.
Ten-year Treasury bond yields -which had fallen to 3.40% in late May - rose to
4.37% by November 30, 2003, in response to a reviving economy, prompting a
market correction. Nonetheless, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index posted
a solidly positive total return of 6.65% for the year ended November 30, 2003.*

STATE TAX RATES HAVE RISEN IN 2003, EVEN AS FEDERAL RATES HAVE BEEN REDUCED...

While federal tax rates were lowered in 2003, the opposite was true of state tax
rates. A revenue shortfall has left many state governments with the difficult
choice between raising taxes or cutting services. The result has been a
widespread trend toward higher income and property taxes. This has left
taxpayers with a larger state tax burden and, once again, made a strong case for
municipal bonds as one of the few remaining ways to trim one's state tax bill.
Therefore, we believe that municipal bonds continue to merit consideration from
tax-conscious investors.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  Following a prolonged period of stagnant demand, the California economy
   posted solid growth in 2003. The economy saw especially strong improvement in
   the manufacturing, service, information technology and commercial
   construction sectors. The state's November 2003 jobless rate was 6.4%, down
   from 6.8% a year ago.

- -  Insured* general obligations (GOs) were the Trust's largest investments at
   November 30, 2003. These insured* issues represented excellent quality,
   especially at a time when the state's fiscal woes remained a major concern
   for taxpayers and investors alike.

- -  Special tax revenue bonds constituted a major commitment for the Trust. These
   issues provide California communities a financing mechanism for public
   facilities that included utilities and road construction projects.

- -  Insured* water and sewer bonds represented significant investments. These
   essential service bonds have generally been insulated from economic
   fluctuations because they represent non-discretionary expenses. These bonds
   financed California communities' urgent efforts to upgrade their water
   infrastructure.

- -  Management continued to adjust coupon structure and upgrade call protection,
   as market conditions warranted. Coupon structure and call features can have a
   significant influence on the Trust's performance characteristics.

PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST YEAR

- -  Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
   total return of 17.06% for the year ended November 30, 2003. That return was
   the result of an increase in share price from $13.66 on November 30, 2002, to
   $14.950 on November 30, 2003, and the reinvestment of $0.963 in regular
   monthly dividends.(3)

- -  Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 12.31% for the year
   ended November 30, 2003. That return was the result of an increase in net
   asset value from $14.59 on November 30, 2002, to $15.32 on November 30, 2003,
   and the reinvestment of all distributions.

- -  Based on the most recent dividend and a share price of $14.950, the Trust had
   a market yield of 6.84% at November 30, 2003.(4) The Trust's market yield is
   equivalent to a taxable yield of 11.60%.(5)

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  Florida's economy rebounded in 2003, with the service sector, health care and
   education quite strong. Tourism was less robust, with job losses in the theme
   park area. Construction produced new jobs, as low interest rates promoted
   residential building. The state's jobless rate was 4.7% in November 2003,
   down from 5.3% a year ago.

- -  Insured* water and sewer bonds represented the Trust's largest sector
   weighting at November 30, 2003. These essential services bonds represent
   high-quality investments that provide financing for Florida's ever-evolving
   infrastructure needs.

- -  The Trust had large investments in insured* transportation bonds, which
   constitute a major portion of Florida municipal issuance. The Trust's
   investments were well-diversified across the state and included bonds for
   ports, turnpikes, expressways and county airport authorities.

- -  Insured* special tax revenue bonds were among the Trust's largest sector
   weightings. These bonds are secured by the levy of special assessments - as
   opposed to property taxes - by local governments. The levies help defray
   costs on improvements or infrastructures that benefit local property owners.

- -  Amid continued low interest rates, management upgraded the Trust's call
   protection. Faced with the prospect of a faster pace of refundings,
   management believes that call protection remains an important strategic
   aspect for municipal bond investors.

   same level as a year ago, but below the national rate.


- -  Education bonds were the Trust's largest sector weighting at November 30,
   2003. Management focused on high quality bonds from some of the
   Commonwealth's finest educational resources.

- -  The Trust was increasingly selective within the hospital sector, which is the
   subject of widespread credit concerns. Amid lower reimbursements and an
   uncertain outlook for Medicare, the Trust focused on institutions with sound
   fundamentals that management believed are likely to emerge in an increasingly
   competitive industry.

- -  Insured* general obligations constituted a major investment for the Trust and
   a representative geographical mix. Issuers included Westfield in western
   Massachusetts, Plymouth in the eastern part of the Commonwealth and Martha's
   Vineyard Land Bank from the Islands.

- -  Management adjusted the Trust's coupon structure, especially within the
   hospital sector. Management also continued its efforts to update call
   protection. The pace of bond calls has picked up in a lower rate environment.

EATON VANCE MICHIGAN MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
MANAGEMENT UPDATE

William H. Ahern
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  Michigan's economy made uneven steps toward recovery in 2003. Manufacturing
   remained mixed, although the state's auto manufacturing sector gained ground
   in the fall months. The building trades remained strong, as residential
   construction activity responded to low interest rates. The state's November
   2003 jobless rate was 7.0%, up from 6.1% a year ago.

- -  Hospital bonds were the Trust's largest sector weighting at November 30,
   2003. In a competitive hospital environment, management emphasized
   institutions they believe are well-regarded and whose in-demand health care
   specialities and financial soundness give them a competitive advantage in
   their markets.

- -  Insured* general obligations (GOs) and uninsured GOs provided a high-quality
   investment in a still-recovering economy. The Trust's investments were
   focused primarily on school district and local board of education issues,
   which typically have stable revenues, a characteristic valued by investors.

- -  The Trust had significant investments in insured* special tax revenue bonds.
   These bonds provide communities with creative funding alternatives and were
   used to finance hotel and development projects in the Detroit metropolitan
   area.

- -  Management continued to make adjustments to coupon structure to improve the
   Trust's performance characteristics. Management also continued to focus on
   call protection. In a low interest rate climate, call protection has proved
   increasingly important.

EATON VANCE NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
MANAGEMENT UPDATE

[PHOTO OF ROBERT B. MACINTOSH]

Robert B. Macintosh
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  The New Jersey economy showed positive trends in 2003. Job growth picked up
   in a number of areas, with notable further gains in manufacturing. While
   retailing has seen uneven growth, residential construction has remained
   robust. The state's November 2003 jobless rate was 5.5%, down from 6.0% a
   year ago and below the national rate.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds remained the Trust's largest sector weighting
   at November 30, 2003. Local port and turnpike authorities are among the
   state's largest issuers and are important components of the state's
   transportation matrix.

- -  Hospital bonds represented major investments for the Trust. Management
   emphasized institutions they believed were most competitive within their
   local market. These included acute care facilities across the state, as well
   as facilities that provided health care specialties, such as care for cardiac
   and lung-related ailments.

- -  Management found some unique opportunities in new issues. For example,
   insured* lease revenue issues for the Garden State Preservation Trust
   provided funding for a land preservation project. The bonds were unusual in
   that they have fairly long maturities for non-callable, zero coupon bonds - a
   rarity in today's market - which increases their convexity, giving them
   better trading characteristics.

- -  Management also found selected opportunities in Puerto Rico bonds. The
   Trust's Puerto Rico holdings included issues for highways, infrastructure
   repair, education, and electric utilities.

EATON VANCE NEW YORK MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
MANAGEMENT UPDATE

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]

Thomas J. Fetter
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  The New York economy showed positive trends in 2003. The manufacturing sector
   continued to give encouraging signals with a pick-up in hiring. Meanwhile,
   the state's key securities industry has seen some job growth accompanying an
   improvement in industry profits. The state's November 2003 jobless rate was
   6.1%, down from 6.3% a year ago.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds were the Trust's largest weighting at November
   30, 2003 and included several segments of the state's transportation complex,
   including bonds for bridges and tunnels, the New York and New Jersey port
   authority and regional airport authorities.

- -  As essential services, electric utilities provided a solid income source.
   With the state experiencing strong power demand, local utilities have needed
   to upgrade and expand facilities. Management believes the bonds offer good
   quality from well-regarded New York issuers.

- -  Management continued to update the Trust's coupon distribution to reflect the
   sharp decline in interest rates. The Trust took advantage of selected Puerto
   Rico bonds to make structural adjustments and increase diversification.

- -  Call protection remained a priority of the Trust. Management sought to
   eliminate bonds with poor call features in favor of those with more call
   protection. Maintaining adequate call protection typically allows bonds to
   participate more fully in market rallies.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  Ohio's economy made progress in 2003, reflecting a newly confident consumer
   sector. While slow to recover, manufacturing saw gradually rising demand in
   some segments. Residential construction remained strong, with modest
   improvement on the commercial side. The state's November 2003 jobless rate
   was 5.7%, up from 5.6% a year ago.

- -  Insured* general obligations represented the Trust's largest sector weighting
   at November 30, 2003. The Trust's investments focused on school district
   bonds of cities and towns management believes are in sound financial
   condition and have relatively strong economic underpinnings.

- -  In an increasingly competitive market, Ohio hospitals have faced the need to
   reduce overhead and restructure operations. Management has focused the
   Trust's hospital investments on institutions that, in management's opinion,
   have contained costs while improving the delivery of health care services.

- -  The Trust had significant investments in industrial development revenue (IDR)
   bonds. The Trust's IDR investments were diversified among some of the
   nation's leading airlines, air freight delivery, auto manufacturers and
   beverage companies.

- -  Insured* special tax revenue bonds were again a major commitment for the
   Trust. These issues provided Ohio counties an alternative method to meet the
   demands of growing communities and finance new infrastructure projects.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

Cynthia J. Clemson
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- -  The Pennsylvania economy rebounded in 2003. The service sector again
   generated the lion's share of job creation, especially in education, health
   care and local government. While manufacturing lost jobs since last year,
   orders have risen in recent months. The Commonwealth's November 2003 jobless
   rate was 5.2%, down from 5.9% a year ago.

- -  Insured* education bonds constituted the Trust's largest sector weighting at
   November 30, 2003, including some of Pennsylvania's finest universities.
   Colleges and universities generally tend to enjoy stable enrollment and
   revenues, irrespective of the economic environment.

- -  The Trust had major investments in insured* general obligations. These bonds
   provided secure income together with diversification among a variety of
   school districts.

- -  Management had large investments in essential services bonds, including
   insured* sewer revenue issues. These issues funded sewer and wastewater
   facilities, vital projects for Pennsylvania's future growth.

- -  The Trust focused on maintaining good credit quality - its average quality
   rating was AA. Given the low interest rate environment, the Trust continued
   to emphasize non-callable bonds and bonds with favorable call
   characteristics. The calling of older, higher-coupon bonds has made call
   protection an important consideration for investors.

The Trust invests primarily in debt securities issued by Massachusetts
municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their
obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or
municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such economic
developments, at November 30, 2003, 39.6% of the securities in the portfolio of
investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and
financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by
financial institutions ranged from 4.7% to 16.6% of total investments.

(1)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
     requirements on open financial futures contracts.

(2)  Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond.

     1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.012, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.012, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.36% to 7.44% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.68% to
     4.73%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.002, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.002, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.60% to 7.61%, and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.81% to
     4.82%. Per share data and ratios for the period prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.005, increase net realized and unrealized losses per
     share by $0.005, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.51% to 7.54% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.74% to
     4.76%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.003, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.003, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.78% to 7.80% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.87% to
     4.88%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distibutions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by substracting the Trust's liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.005, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.005, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.80% to 7.84% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.88% to
     4.91%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums of fixed-income securities. The effect of this

     income per share by $0.003, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.003, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.45% to 7.48% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.67% to

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance California Municipal Income Trust (California Trust), Eaton Vance
   Florida Municipal Income Trust (Florida Trust), Eaton Vance Massachusetts
   Municipal Income Trust (Massachusetts Trust), Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal
   Income Trust (Michigan Trust), Eaton Vance New Jersey Municipal Income Trust
   (New Jersey Trust), Eaton Vance New York Municipal Income Trust (New York
   Trust), Eaton Vance Ohio Municipal Income Trust (Ohio Trust), and Eaton Vance
   Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (Pennsylvania Trust), (individually
   referred to as the Trust or collectively the Trusts) are registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end
   management investment companies. The Trusts were organized under the laws of
   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust
   dated December 10, 1998. Each Trust's investment objective is to achieve
   current income exempt from regular federal income taxes and taxes in its
   specified state. Each Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing
   primarily in investment grade municipal obligations issued by its specified
   state.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by each Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Futures contracts listed on the
   commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Short-term
   obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
   which approximates fair value. Investments for which valuations or market
   quotations are unavailable are valued at fair value using methods determined
   in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

   B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

   D FEDERAL TAXES -- Each Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of
   the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable, if any, and
   tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore,
   no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At November 30,
   2003, the Trusts, for federal income tax purposes, had capital loss
   carryovers which will reduce taxable income arising from future net realized
   gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
   Code, and thus will reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders
   which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trusts of any liability for
   federal income or excise tax. The amounts and expiration dates of the capital
   loss carryovers of each Trust are as follows:

   In addition, each Trust intends to satisfy conditions which will enable it to
   designate distributions from the interest income generated by its investments
   in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal income taxes
   when received by each Trust, as exempt-interest dividends. The portion of
   such interest, if any, earned on private activity bonds issued after August
   7, 1986, may be considered a tax preference item for investors.

   E FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, a Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by a Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by a Trust. A Trust's investment
   in financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against
   anticipated future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should
   interest rates move unexpectedly, a Trust may not achieve the anticipated
   benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   F OPTIONS ON FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the purchase of a put option
   on a financial futures contract by a Trust, the premium paid is recorded as
   an investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
   option expires, a Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the
   option. When a Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, a Trust will
   realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the
   closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option.
   When a Trust exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk
   associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium originally
   paid.

   G USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   H EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trusts. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT
   receives a fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average
   daily cash balances each Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit
   balances used to reduce the Trusts' custodian fees are reported as a
   reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   Each Trust issued Auction Preferred Shares on March 1, 1999 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded
   as a reduction of capital of the common shares of each Trust. Dividends on
   the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
   at the offering of each Trust's APS and have been reset every seven days
   thereafter by an auction.

   Auction Preferred Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2003 and
   dividend rate ranges for the year ended November 30, 2003 are as indicated
   below:

   Pennsylvania                     900              0.50% - 1.65%
</Table>

   The APS are redeemable at the option of each Trust at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if any Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the Common Shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each Trust is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in each
   Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each Trust pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auction.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   Each Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for Auction
   Preferred Shares on November 30, 2003 are listed below. For the year ended
   November 30, 2003, the amount of dividends each Trust paid to Auction
   Preferred shareholders and average APS dividend rates for such period were as
   follows:

</Table>

   The Funds distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid-in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.70% of each
   Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to each
   Trust. Except for Trustees of each Trust who are not members of EVM's
   organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services
   to each Trust out of such investment adviser fee. For the year ended November
   30, 2003, the fee was equivalent to 0.70% of each Trust's average weekly
   gross assets and amounted to $1,169,695, $700,053, $429,013, $341,202,
   $733,594, $887,696, $452,521, and $434,248, for California Trust, Florida
   Trust, Massachusetts Trust, Michigan Trust, New Jersey Trust, New York Trust,
   Ohio Trust and Pennsylvania Trust, respectively. EVM also serves as the
   administrator of each Trust. An administration fee, computed at the annual

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   Each Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment a Trust has
   in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily
   represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the
   risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related
   and offsetting transactions are considered.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE TRUSTEES OF EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF EATON

TRUST, EATON VANCE MASSACHUSETTS MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST, EATON VANCE MICHIGAN
MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST, EATON VANCE NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST, EATON
VANCE NEW YORK MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST, EATON VANCE OHIO MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST,
AND EATON VANCE PENNSYLVANIA MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST:

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Eaton Vance California Municipal Income Trust,
Eaton Vance Florida Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance Massachusetts Municipal
Income Trust, Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance New
Jersey Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance New York Municipal Income Trust,
Eaton Vance Ohio Municipal Income Trust, and Eaton Vance Pennsylvania Municipal
Income Trust (the Trusts), (constituting the Eaton Vance Municipal Income
Trusts) as of November 30, 2003, and the related statements of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
years in the four year period ended November 30, 2003 and for the period from
the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November 30, 1999. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trusts'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities held as of November 30, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received
from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance California Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance Florida Municipal Income
Trust, Eaton Vance Massachusetts Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance Michigan
Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance New Jersey Municipal Income Trust, Eaton
Vance New York Municipal Income Trust, Eaton Vance Ohio Municipal Income Trust,
and Eaton Vance Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust as of November 30, 2003, the

assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and their financial
highlights for the respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc., at
1-800-331-1710.

APPLICATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   This form is for shareholders who hold their common shares in their own
   names. If your common shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank,
   or other nominee, you should contact your nominee to see if it will
   participate in the Plan on your behalf. If you wish to participate in the
   Plan, but your brokerage firm, bank, or nominee is unable to participate on
   your behalf, you should request that your common shares be re-registered in
   your own name which will enable your participation in the Plan.

The following authorization and appointment is given with the understanding that
I may terminate it at any time by terminating my participation in the Plan as
provided in the terms and conditions of the Plan.
