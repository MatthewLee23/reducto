Letter to Stockholders

GLOBAL MARKET OVERVIEW

     The long awaited  interest  rate  increase  took place at the June 30, 2004
meeting of the Federal Reserve (the "Fed"). By increasing rates by only 25 basis
points,  the Fed did not  surprise  the  market and kept  rates  below  expected
inflation,  a  position  that can still be viewed  as very  accommodative.  U.S.
monetary policy is widely expected to be changed at a measured pace,  especially
since the  effect of higher  market  rates  leading  up to the Fed  meeting  was
already  being  felt,  slowing  down  some  sectors  of the  economy.  This slow
tightening  pace is likely to put even more selling  pressure on the U.S. dollar
due to its increasingly real yield disadvantage.

     Volatility  and trading  volume have been low in the second quarter in most
of the world  markets.  Large  capitalization  stocks have usually  outperformed
small and mid capitalization stocks, as markets have become narrower, with fewer
stocks holding up the indices.  Energy was the big winner as oil prices, defying
expectations, went from $30 to $40 a barrel. Financial services stocks were weak
as investors  anticipated  that the peak of the earning  cycle had been reached.
The raw materials and  industrial  metals  sectors were volatile due to concerns
about the  magnitude  of the  slowdown  in Chinese  demand  precipitated  by the
implementation of government policies aimed at bringing inflation under control.
However, its underlying trend remains up.

     Overall the sideways price action in stocks reflected investors' fears that
operating  margins  have no room left to expand  and that  sales are  reaching a
plateau in the current cycle as U.S. consumer spending lacks the stimulus of tax
reductions and mortgage refinancings this time around.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES

     On June 17, 2004, the Swiss National Bank (SNB)  increased the target range
for the  three-month  LIBOR by 25 basis points.  The interest rate range extends
now from 0.0% to 1.0%.  This move reverses half of the latest  interest rate cut
of March 6, 2003. Even after this adjustment, the SNB affirmed that its monetary
policy  would  remain  expansionary  and would  continue to support the economic
upswing.

     Real gross domestic  product in the third and fourth  quarters of 2003 grew
at an annualized rate of more than 2% compared with the previous quarter. In the
first  quarter of this year the trend  continued  at a slightly  weaker  rate of
1.6%. The SNB is forecasting economic growth of close to 2% for this year.

     More  evidence of the economic  upswing is the  stabilization  of the labor
market.  As of June 30, 2004, the unemployment rate was 3.7%, down from a 5-year
high point of 4.1% reached in January.

     The SNB noted that  inflation  remained  within the range that equates with
price  stability  despite rising oil prices.  A strong Swiss franc helped,  to a
certain extent, to offset the increase in the oil prices. On the assumption that
the three-month LIBOR will

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

remain stable at 0.5%, the SNB forecasts that average annual inflation will
amount to 0.6% this year, 1% in 2005 and 2% in 2006.

     The ten-year  spot interest  rate on  Confederation  bonds climbed from its
lowest level of 2.37% in mid March to 2.87% at the end of June.

SWISS MARKET REVIEW AND FUND PERFORMANCE

     The Swiss market was resilient,  with the Swiss  Performance  Index ("SPI")
showing a return of 4% in U.S.  dollar  terms  with a currency  appreciation  of
1.27%.  The Fund  outperformed  the SPI by 0.15% due to the good  performance of
most  of the mid  capitalization  stocks  in  which  the  Fund  has  substantial
positions.

     The  best  performing  sectors  on  the  Swiss  market   year-to-date  were
Construction  (+25.3%),  led by Holcim Ltd. which increased by 23% helped by its
exposure to emerging markets; Basic Resources (+22.4%), mainly led by increasing
demand in steel;  Utility  Suppliers (+19%) led by energy stocks;  and, finally,
Chemicals (+12.3%),  led mainly by Syngenta AG, which increased by 27% thanks to
the increasing demand in seeds and crop protection products.

     As shown in the following table, the Fund's  cumulative  performance  since
1996 continues to be superior to its Swiss peers and its  benchmark.  As of June
30, 2004, the Fund maintained an overall rating of four stars from  Morningstar.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

*Lipper,  Inc. is an independent  fund performance  monitor.  As of December 31,
2003,  there  were 8 funds  in the  Lipper  Western  European  closed-end  funds
category,  which is comprised of funds that  concentrate  their  investments  in
equity securities whose primary trading markets or operations are in the Western
European region or a single country within this region.

**Morningstar is an independent fund  performance  monitor.  Its ratings reflect
historic  risk-adjusted  performance and may change monthly.  Its ratings of one
(low) and five (high) stars are based on a fund's three- and  five-year  average
annual total returns with fee adjustments,  and a risk factor that reflects fund
performance relative to three-month  Treasury Bill monthly returns.  Only 33% of
the funds in an investment  category may receive four or five stars.  As of June
30, 2004, there were 10 funds in the Fund's asset category rated by Morningstar.

(1)  Performance of funds is based on changes in the fund's NAV over a specified
period.  In each case total return is calculated  assuming  reinvestment  of all
distributions.  Funds listed, other than Switzerland iShares, are not registered
with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  Performance  and  descriptive
information  about the funds are derived from their published  investor  reports
and websites, which are subject to change.

(2) Switzerland  iShares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and invest in
most of the same  stocks  listed in the  Morgan  Stanley  Capital  International
(Switzerland)  Index.  These  stocks  represent  Switzerland's  largest and most
established  public  companies,  accounting for  approximately 85% of the market
capitalization  of all of Switzerland's  publicly traded stocks.  Performance of
iShares is  calculated  based upon the  closing  prices of the period  indicated
using the Swiss  franc/U.S.  dollar  exchange rate as of noon each such date, as
reported by  Bloomberg.  Such exchange  rates were as follows:  12/31/96 = 1.35,
12/31/97 = 1.46,  12/31/98 = 1.38,  12/31/99 = 1.60, 12/31/00 = 1.61, 12/31/01 =
1.67, 12/31/02 = 1.39, 12/31/03 = 1.24 and 6/30/04 = 1.25.

(3) This fund  invests in  equities  issued by leading  Swiss  companies.  Stock
selection is based on economic, sector and company analyses. Preference is given
to large-cap companies.

(4) This fund invests primarily in major Swiss companies.  Quality criteria used
for determining relative weightings of companies include: strategic orientation,
strength of market  position,  quality of  management,  soundness  of  earnings,
growth potential and potential for improving  shareholder  value. The investment
objective seeks to provide results that are aligned with the SPI performance.

(5) This fund  invests in shares of Swiss  companies  listed on the Swiss  Stock
Exchange (SWX) and included in the SPI.

(6) This fund  invests  in  shares of Swiss  companies.  It  weights  individual
sectors relative to the SPI on the basis of their expected relative performance.
It focuses on liquid blue-chip stocks.

(7) These funds are not available for U.S. residents or citizens.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

OUTLOOK

     Abundant uncertainties and high earnings expectations, especially for 2005,
increased  the risk  for  equity  investments.  However,  reasonable  historical
valuations  and the lack of  other  investment  opportunities  in a world of low
fixed-income yields are supportive factors.

     In historic terms,  the Swiss market's  valuation is favorable,  with stock
prices discounting a more difficult future,  mainly in the insurance and banking
sectors.   Industrial  and  construction  companies  continue  to  represent  an
interesting long-term opportunity due to their exposure to the emerging markets.
Their performance was among the strongest on the Swiss market year-to-date.

     The defensive  segment of the market,  which is very large for  Switzerland
(about 50% of the market is  represented  by  consumer  staples  and  healthcare
companies),  has held well and should be resilient in the case of slower  global
economic  growth.  Moreover,  it would be  beneficial  if long-term  bond yields
stayed on a moderate  upward  path,  as has been the case in the second  quarter
under review. In fact, contrary to our expectations,  U.S. long bond yields have
come down since mid June despite the weakening of the U.S. currency and the size
of the budget deficit.  This shows investor nervousness about the projection for
economic expansion.

     In that context,  Management  believes that the short term  performance  of
economically  sensitive  sectors and the market  overall  will be muted,  with a
sequential  decline,  most  likely in the third  quarter,  in sales  numbers for

     Pursuant  to  authorization  by the  Board,  the  Fund  began  open  market
purchases  of its common  stock on the New York Stock  Exchange  in 1999 and has
continued  purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance  stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share  without  creating a  meaningful  adverse  effect upon the
Fund's  expense ratio and without  realizing  capital gains in order to fund the
repurchases.  The Board has  authorized  the purchase of up to 500,000 shares in
2004. During the six months ended June 30,

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

NOTE 1-- ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION

The Swiss  Helvetia Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") is registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"),  as a  non-diversified,  closed-end
investment  management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The  investment  objective  of the Fund is to seek  long-term  growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES

The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity  securities,  the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity securities
that are not listed or that are listed  but have not  traded,  the Fund uses the
mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities,  the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the  calculation  of the Fund's net asset  value.  If a current bid price is not
available,  the Fund  uses the mean  between  the  latest  quoted  bid and asked
prices.  When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the  responsibility  of the Fund's  Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") to
establish fair valuation  procedures.  When valuing  securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that are
available are considered  unreliable,  the Fund  determines a fair value in good
faith in accordance with these procedures.  The Fund may use these procedures to
establish the fair value of securities  when, for example,  a significant  event
occurs  between  the time the  market  closes  and the time the Fund  values its
investments.  After  consideration  of various  factors,  the Fund may value the
securities  at their last  reported  price or at some other  value.  On June 30,
2004, there were no fair valued securities.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Securities  transactions  are  recorded  on the trade date.  Realized  gains and
losses are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend  income,  net  of  any  foreign  taxes  withheld,  is  recorded  on the
ex-dividend  date.  Interest  income,  including  amortization  of premiums  and
accretion of discounts,  is accrued daily.  Estimated  expenses are also accrued
daily.

The  Fund  records  Swiss  withholding  tax as an  expense,  net  of any  amount
receivable  from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax treaty between
the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS

The Fund pays dividends  annually to the extent it has any net investment income
and  net  realized   gains  from  foreign   currency   transactions   and  makes
distributions  of any net realized  capital  gains to the extent they exceed any
capital loss  carryforwards.  The Fund  determines  the size and nature of these
distributions  in  accordance  with  provisions  of the Internal  Revenue  Code.
Distributions  may be paid  either  in cash or in stock  with an  option to take
cash.  The  Fund  records  dividends  and  distributions  on  its  books  on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue  Code that are  applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  and to
distribute all its taxable  income to its  stockholders.  Therefore,  no federal
income tax provision is required.

F. SECURITIES LENDING

The  Fund  may lend  securities  to  financial  institutions.  The Fund  retains
beneficial  ownership of the  securities  it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts  equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any changes in their  market  value.  For the initial  transaction,  the Fund
requires the borrowers of the securities to establish  collateral  with the Fund
in the form of cash and/or  government  securities equal to 105% of the value of
the securities loaned. Subsequent to the initial transaction,  the Fund requires
the borrowers to maintain collateral with the Fund equal to 100% of the value of
the securities  loaned.  The Fund receives fees as compensation  for lending its
securities. Either the Fund or the borrower may

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

terminate the securities loan at any time. On June 30, 2004 there were no
securities on loan.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The Fund maintains its accounting  records in U.S. dollars.  The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency  denominated  assets,  liabilities and
transactions  by  using  prevailing   exchange  rates.  In  valuing  assets  and
liabilities,  the Fund uses the prevailing  exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing  securities  transactions,  the  receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized  gains and losses on foreign  currency  translations
shown on the  Fund's  financial  statements  result  from  the  sale of  foreign
currencies,  from  currency  gains or  losses  realized  between  the  trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between the
amounts of dividends,  interest,  and foreign  withholding taxes recorded on the
Fund's books and the U.S. dollar  equivalent of the amounts actually received or
paid.

When  calculating  realized and  unrealized  gains or losses on  investments  in
equity  securities,  the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the  foreign  currency  price of the  security  from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.

On June 30, 2004, the Fund held the following currency contracts:

H. ESTIMATES

In preparing its financial  statements in conformity with accounting  principles
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  management  makes  estimates  and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

NOTE 2-- FEES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The Fund and the Advisor have agreed to share certain common expenses subject to

Committee's  allocations are based on its determination of the relative benefits
the  Fund and the  Advisor  derive  from  the  expenditures.  During  2004,  the
Committee  allocated $9,300 of expenses  incurred in connection with publicizing
the Fund as follows: $4,650 to the Fund and $4,650 to the Advisor.

NOTE 5-- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The aggregate  cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of  investments,  other
than  short-term  obligations,  for the six  months  ended June 30,  2004,  were
$62,007,887 and $77,070,778, respectively.

The net unrealized  appreciation from investments for those securities having an
excess of value over cost was $188,475,986  and the net unrealized  depreciation
from  investments for those  securities  having an excess of cost over value was
$1,356,625.

NOTE 6-- STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

Pursuant to  authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its  common  stock  on the New York  Stock  Exchange  in 1999 and has  continued
purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock repurchase
program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net asset value
per share without  creating a meaningful  adverse effect upon the Fund's expense
ratio and without realizing capital gains in order to fund the repurchases.  The
Board has authorized  the purchase of up to 500,000  shares in 2004.  During the
six months ended June 30, 2004, the Fund  repurchased and retired 128,400 shares
at an average price of $12.89 per share (including brokerage  commissions) and a
weighted average discount of 17.86%.  These repurchases,  which had a total cost
of  $1,654,922,  resulted  in an  increase  of  $359,779 to the Fund's net asset
value.

NOTE 7-- LITIGATION

On April 2, 2001 and May 8, 2001, two complaints  were filed in purported  class
actions on behalf of  stockholders  of the Fund, in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware,  against the Fund,  each of its directors and HCC, the Fund's
Investment Advisor  (collectively,  the  "defendants").  The complaints in these
cases,  entitled  KIMBERLY KAHN V. PAUL  HOTTINGUER ET AL. and CHARLES MILLER V.
PAUL  HOTTINGUER ET AL.,  have been  voluntarily  dismissed by  plaintiffs  with
prejudice  pursuant to a settlement  agreement that was approved by the Delaware
Chancery Court on June 4, 2003. In the opinion of  management,  the terms of the
settlement did not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of
the Fund.

NOTE 8-- PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio  securities is available,  without charge,
by calling 1-888-SWISS-00.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

The Plan
The Fund's Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest your capital gains  distributions  and ordinary income dividends
in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:

      -   Once you  enroll in the Plan,  all of your  future  distributions  and
          dividends  payable  in whole or in part in cash will be  automatically
          reinvested in Fund shares.
      -   You will  receive  shares  valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset
          value or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount
          of your  distribution or dividend will be reinvested  automatically in
          additional  Fund  shares.  For any  balance  that is  insufficient  to
          purchase  full shares of the Fund,  your account will be credited with
          fractional shares.
      -   Your shares will be held in an account  with the Plan agent.  You will
          be sent regular statements for your records.
      -   You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

     The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

How do I enroll in the Plan?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company  (AST) at the address shown below.  If your shares are held in a
brokerage  account,  contact your broker.  Not all brokerage  firms permit their
clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the Plan and, even
if  your  brokerage  firm  does  permit  participation,  you  may not be able to
transfer your Plan shares to another  broker who does not permit  participation.
Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its policies.

How does the Plan work?
Any dividends or  distributions  you receive will be reinvested in shares of the
Fund.  The  number of shares  credited  to your Plan  account as a result of the
reinvestment  will depend upon the relationship  between the Fund's market price
and its net asset  value per share on the  record  date of the  distribution  or
dividend, as described below:

      -   If the net asset value is greater  than the market  price (the Fund is
          trading at a  discount),  AST as Plan Agent,  will buy Fund shares for
          your  account  on the open  market on the New York Stock  Exchange  or
          elsewhere.  Your dividends or distributions  will be reinvested at the
          average price AST pays for those purchases.
      -   If the net  asset  value is equal to the  market  price  (the  Fund is
          trading at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at
          net asset value.
      -   If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
          (the  Fund is  trading  at a premium  of less than 5%),  the Fund will
          issue for your account new shares at net asset value.
       -  If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market  price (the Fund
          is trading  at a premium of 5% or more),  the Fund will issue for your
          account new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST  begins to buy Fund  shares for your  account at a discount  to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price increases
to a level above the net asset  value,  AST will  complete its  purchases,  even
though the result may be that the average price paid for the  purchases  exceeds
net asset value.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited) (concluded)

Will the entire amount of my distribution or dividend be reinvested?
The  entire  amount of your  distribution  or  dividend  will be  reinvested  in
additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase of whole shares,
your  account  will be credited  with any  fractional  shares  (rounded to three
decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

How can I sell my shares?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan  account by  contacting  AST.
AST charges $15 for the  transaction  plus $.10 per share for this service.  You
can also  withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

Does participation in the Plan change the tax status of my distributions or
dividends?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is the
same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of  distributions
and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

Can I get certificates for the shares in the Plan?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates for
fractional shares will not be issued.

Is there any charge to participate in the Plan?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro rata
share of  brokerage  commissions  incurred  with  respect to AST's  open  market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

How can I discontinue my participation in the Plan?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account, AST
will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any fractional
shares.

Where can I direct my questions and correspondence?
Contact your broker, or contact AST as follows:

     By mail:
       American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
       PO Box 922
       Wall Street Station
       New York, NY 10269-0560

     Through the Internet:

expires December 31, 2004.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
The Fund has a Nominating  Committee,  which is  responsible  for  selecting and
nominating  persons for  election or  appointment  by the Fund's  Board as Board
members.  The Nominating  Committee has adopted a Nominating  Committee  Charter
(the "Charter"). Pursuant to the Charter, the Nominating Committee will consider
recommendations for nominees from shareholders submitted to the Secretary of the
Fund, c/o The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc., 1270 Avenue of the Americas, Suite 400,
New York,  New York 10020.  A nominating  submission  must  include  information
regarding the recommended nominee as specified in the Charter.  This information
includes all information  relating to a recommended  nominee that is required to
be  disclosed in  solicitations  or proxy  statements  for the election of Board
members,  as well as  information  sufficient  to  evaluate  the  factors  to be
considered by the  Nominating  Committee,  including  character  and  integrity;
experience in business,  investment and economic  matters in Europe,  the United
States,  or Switzerland  or political  matters of  Switzerland;  and whether the
person has the  ability to apply sound and  independent  business  judgment  and
would  act in the  interests  of  the  Fund  and  its  shareholders.  Nomination
submissions  are  required  to  be  accompanied  by a  written  consent  of  the
individual  to stand  for  election  if  nominated  by the Board and to serve if
elected by the  shareholders,  and such additional  information must be provided
regarding  the  recommended  nominee as reasonably  requested by the  Nominating
Committee.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(a) The  Fund's  principal  executive  and  principal  financial  officers  have
concluded,  based on their  evaluation  of the Fund's  disclosure  controls  and
procedures  as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this report,  that
the Fund's disclosure  controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Fund on Form N-CSR is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and that the
information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports that it files or
submits on Form N-CSR is accumulated and communicated to the Fund's  management,
including  its  principal  executive  and  principal   financial  officers,   as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)  There  were no  changes  in the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial
reporting that occurred  during the Fund's most recently ended fiscal  half-year
(the Registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that
have materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially  affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
