1. ORGANIZATION

Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management
investment company and which has many of the features of a private investment
fund. The Fund's interests ("Interests") are offered only in private placements
to persons (i) who are both "accredited investors" under the Securities Act of
1933 and "qualified clients" under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended and (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the
Fund. The primary investment objective of the Fund is to provide investors with
an attractive, long-term rate of return, on an absolute as well as a
risk-adjusted basis, with low performance volatility and minimal correlation
with the equity and fixed income markets. The Fund's strategy is to (i) invest
in 25-50 partnerships and other investment vehicles ("Portfolio Funds") managed
by different investment managers and (ii) construct a portfolio employing
various arbitrage and equity strategies to achieve the risk control benefits of
diversification together with the value of a hedged investment approach.

Columbia Management Company was the Fund's investment adviser until it merged
into Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Columbia Management Group, Inc. and Fleet National Bank, on April
1, 2003. The merger did not change the way the Fund is managed, the investment
personnel assigned to manage the Fund or the fees paid by the Fund to the
Adviser. The Adviser has retained Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P.
("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as subadviser to the Fund. The Adviser and the
Subadviser have been designated as special members (the "Special Members") of
the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for implementing the Fund's investment strategy
and managing the Fund's investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis, in
accordance with the investment objective, philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's confidential offering memorandum and subject to oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's investments are fair valued by the Adviser. Investments in Portfolio
Funds are valued at net asset value, which approximates fair value, as reported
by the administrators or portfolio managers of the Portfolio Funds. Such values
generally represent the Fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the
Portfolio Funds. Accordingly, the value of investments in Portfolio Funds is
generally increased by additional contributions to the Portfolio Funds and the
Fund's share of net earnings from the Portfolio Funds and decreased by
distributions and the Fund's share of net losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are initially valued at cost, with subsequent adjustments to values, which
reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains
and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the identified
cost basis.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Investors") are individually required to report on its own tax return its
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E.   CASH

At September 30, 2003, $1,026,979 in cash was held on deposit at PFPC Trust
Company, the Fund's custodian.

F.   ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING EXPENSES

The Adviser has entered into an expense deferral agreement (the "Expense
Deferral Agreement") with the Fund dated December 19, 2002, as amended December
31, 2002, whereby the Fund, upon request of the Adviser, agrees to repay
$366,088 to the Adviser for organizational and initial offering costs advanced
by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund, subject to certain conditions. Such
repayment is contingent upon the expenses of the Fund (exclusive of brokerage
costs, interest, taxes or extraordinary expenses and management fees or
performance-based fees paid by the Fund), including such repayment, being
limited to no more than 0.75% per annum of average members' capital of the Fund.
The Expense Deferral Agreement terminates on April 1, 2006, and the Fund has no
obligation to pay to the Adviser any organizational or initial offering costs
still outstanding to the Adviser as of that date. Through September 30, 2003,
the Adviser has requested repayment of $10,000 of such expenses, and is
reflected on the statement of operations as expense deferral payable to Adviser.
The Adviser agreed to forego $28,623 of reimbursement of deferred expenses at
September 30, 2003.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, INCENTIVE ALLOCATION, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

Pursuant to a management agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the average members' capital of the Fund. Pursuant to the terms of a
subadvisory agreement between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a
portion of the management fee that it receives from the Fund to the Subadviser.

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE, INCENTIVE ALLOCATION, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER
     (CONTINUED)

An incentive allocation will be calculated with respect to each Investor on the
last business day of a calendar year and upon repurchase of all or any portion
of such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive Period"). An Incentive Period for
each Investor's Interest starts immediately following the preceding Incentive
Period and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business
day of a calendar year; (ii) the next repurchase of all or any portion of such
Investor's Interest; (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in
connection with such party ceasing to serve as Adviser or Subadviser to the
Fund; or (iv) the dissolution of the Fund. The aggregate incentive allocation
(to the Special Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount, if
any, in excess of (a) profit net of losses (after taking into account expenses,
including the management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Investor's
capital account for such Incentive Period over (b) the greater of (i) the
Investor's Hurdle Rate Amount for that Incentive Period and (ii) the balance in
the Investor's Loss Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period. An
Investor's "Loss Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period thereafter is equal to the Investor's Loss Carryforward as
of the end of the immediately preceding Incentive Period, increased or
decreased, but not below zero, by the positive or negative difference between
the net losses over net profits allocated to the Investor for the current
Incentive Period. The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return an Investor would
receive if its Interest as of the beginning of that Incentive Period (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter and reset on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive Period. The Hurdle
Rate Amount for the quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September
30, 2003 is 1.213%, 1.137% and 1.038% per annum, respectively, and the incentive
allocation that would have been allocated to the Special Members if September
30, 2003 were a calendar year-end is $348,773.

In the case of a repurchase of only a portion of an Interest other than on the
last business day of the calendar year, the Investor will be treated as having
two independent Interests in the Fund, one of which is being repurchased in its
entirety. Allocations to the Investor and capital contributions made by the
Investor during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution,
and the Investor's opening capital account balance and Loss Carryforward as of
the beginning of such Incentive Period, will be allocated between the two
Interests in proportion to the portion of the Investor's Interest that is
repurchased or distributed.

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE, INCENTIVE ALLOCATION, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER
     (CONTINUED)

Each director who is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined by the
1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $5,000 plus a fee of $1,250 for each
meeting attended. Any director or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund. All directors are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial Services Group) serves as
custodian of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of The PNC Financial Services Group) serves as
administrator and accounting agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides
certain accounting, record keeping, tax and investor related services. The Fund
pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the administrator based primarily upon
average members' capital, subject to a monthly minimum fee.

4.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each calendar month, the Fund allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Investors, in proportion to
their respective opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net profits or net losses for a given fiscal period are measured by the net
change in the value of the members' capital of the Fund, including any net
change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments, realized
income, gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period, before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital contributions made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

                   For the six months ended September 30, 2003

4.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Interests are offered monthly. The minimum initial investment is $150,000,
although the Fund (or its designated agent) may waive this minimum. The Fund may
from time to time offer to repurchase outstanding Interests based on the Fund's
members' capital pursuant to written tenders from Investors. These repurchases
will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board,
in its complete and exclusive discretion. The Board authorized the Fund to
conduct a $25,000,000 tender offer effective December 31, 2003. Such tender
offer expired at midnight on October 24, 2003 with approximately $750,000 in
interests being tendered.

5.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. To the extent
that the Fund's investment activity is limited to making investments in
investment funds via limited partnership interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these investments reported by the Fund. For the period ended
September 30, 2003, the Fund had only invested in such limited partnership and
limited liability interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end investment company, its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Investors and will not be exchangeable for interests
of any other fund. Although the Board in its discretion may cause the Fund to
offer from time to time to repurchase Interests at their members' capital
account value, the Interests are considerably less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies. With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate repurchase
amount will be determined by the Board in its discretion and such repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's outstanding Interests.
Because the Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds themselves have limited
liquidity, the Fund may not be able to fund significant repurchases. Investors
whose Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate significantly between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

5.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

There are a number of other risks to the Fund. Three principal types of risk
that can adversely affect the Fund's investment approach are market risk,
strategy risk, and manager risk. The Fund also is subject to multiple manager
risks, possible limitations in investment opportunities, allocation risks,
illiquidity, lack of diversification, and other risks for the Fund and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would
involve future claims against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However,
based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

6.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically provide for
compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned. The Portfolio Funds generally provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to one year from initial investment. Some Portfolio Funds may charge
redemption fees. Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing market conditions. None of the Portfolio Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

Aggregate purchases of Portfolio Funds for the six months ended September 30,
2003 amounted to $47,900,000, including $10,000,000 in purchases of Portfolio
Funds paid in advance of October Portfolio Fund openings. Portfolio Fund
investments sold during the six months ended September 30, 2003 amounted to
$2,139,582.

6.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS (CONTINUED)

The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes will be adjusted for
items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Portfolio Funds at the
end of each calendar year, when the Portfolio Funds report taxable income to the
Fund. For the period January 2, 2003 through September 30, 2003, taxable income
allocated to the Fund from the Portfolio Funds is not yet available. At
September 30, 2003, net realized gain on Portfolio Fund investments totaled
$308,860. At September 30, 2003, net unrealized appreciation on Portfolio Fund
investments totaled $4,245,531, consisting of $5,159,641 of gross unrealized
appreciation and $914,110 of gross unrealized depreciation, based on the cost of
Portfolio Fund investments for financial reporting purposes.

At September 30, 2003, the Fund's management is unaware of any significant
issuer concentrations in the underlying Portfolio Funds. The Fund's investments
at September 30, 2003 are summarized below based on the investment strategy of
each specific Portfolio Fund.

     (b)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
