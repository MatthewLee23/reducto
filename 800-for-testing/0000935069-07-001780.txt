FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund seeks to preserve capital. The Fund
pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans.

FUND RECAP

Fiscal 2007 continued to be a positive environment for senior secured
floating-rate loan ("Senior Loan") investing. The Fund continued to benefit from
a benign credit environment primarily due to a strong U.S. economy, which kept
market-wide default rates at very low levels. Additionally, continued strong
investor demand for the Senior Loan asset class due to its appealing
risk-adjusted returns kept secondary prices firm across the Senior Loan market,
and a robust merger and acquisition environment created a steady supply of new
Senior Loans.

FCT generated a total return of 15.95%, including market price change and
dividends, for the year ended May 31, 2007 ("Fiscal 2007"). The Fund's Net Asset
Value ("NAV") total return was 8.04% over the period. During Fiscal 2007, the
Fund declared dividends totaling $1.50 per share compared to $1.30 in the prior
year, a 15.4% increase.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund's strong market price performance during Fiscal 2007 was complemented
by the Fund's NAV performance/total return and high dividend yield. The Fund's
return exceeded the benchmark (Standard & Poor's/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index)
return of 7.30% for the same period. The Fund's performance includes the
beneficial impact of leverage, and the negative impact of fees, expenses and
un-invested cash balances, which are not part of the benchmark return.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We were very pleased with the continued dividend growth and the resulting high
dividend yield of the Fund. Based on its most recent dividend, FCT paid a yield
of 8.09% calculated on the Fund's market price and 8.05% based on the Fund's NAV
as of May 31, 2007.

We were equally pleased with the stability of the Fund's NAV and the reduction
of the discount between price and NAV. During the year, the Fund's NAV ranged
from a high of $18.97 to a low of $18.68, a range of approximately 1.5%. The
market price of the Fund closed as high as $18.98 (April 18, 2007) and as low as
$17.53 (June 13, 2006). The Fund's closing price on May 31, 2007 was $18.81,
which was a 0.5% discount to its NAV, which compares favorably to the Fund's
discount to NAV of 7.3% on May 31, 2006.

Please note that past performance is not indicative, nor intended as a
guarantee, of future performance.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

During Fiscal 2007, Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") continued to expand and,
notwithstanding the recent downward revision of first-quarter GDP growth to
0.6%, corporate earnings remained very strong. While we do not expect corporate
earnings to sustain their year-over-year double digit growth levels, earnings
are generally expected to remain relatively strong through 2007, which, combined
with low real interest rates, should, in our opinion, continue to help enable
the companies in which we invest to service their debt.

Notwithstanding the decline in Senior Loan credit spreads in recent years, the
Fund still increased its dividend 13 times since the Federal Reserve (the "Fed")
tightening began in 2004 and four times in Fiscal 2007. Increases in short-term
interest rates generally enable Senior Loan funds to increase their dividends
with a minor timing lag. Additionally, since Senior Loans have very low duration
and minimal interest rate risk, increases in short-term rates are not expected
to have a meaningful impact on NAV. We believe the Fund has demonstrated low NAV
volatility during this cycle's tightening.

Inflows into the Senior Loan asset class during Fiscal 2007 were exceptional and
occurred in tandem with record growth in new Senior Loan issuance and trading
volume. The first quarter of 2007 was the busiest quarter ever for the Senior
Loan market, with over $183 billion of new Senior Loans being issued. 1 Much of
this issuance was driven by large mergers, acquisitions and corporate
financings. Examples of companies that were recently issuers of sizable Senior
Loans include: Univision - the leading U.S. Spanish language broadcaster; Kinder
Morgan - one of the largest pipeline companies in the country; and
Freeport-McMoRan - the second largest copper producer in the world. In each of
these cases, the Senior Loans are in the senior-most position in these
companies' capital structures, which means that they are repaid first if the
companies experience financial difficulty. While there has been much recent
media attention on the loosening of lending standards in the corporate credit
markets, it is worth reminding investors that Senior Loans generally hold one of
the most senior positions in the capital structure of a business entity (the
"Borrower"), are typically secured with specific collateral and have a claim on
the assets and/or stock of the Borrower that is senior to that held by
subordinated debtholders and stockholders of the Borrower.

As previously mentioned, the demand for Senior Loans remained strong as
investors perceived reduced levels of risk resulting from an improving economic
environment and low levels of defaults and credit losses, as well as the returns
benefit of a floating-rate asset class. For calendar year 2006, Senior Loans
generated a total return of 6.77% (S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index), which
compares favorably to 10-year Treasury returns of 1.36%, but trailed high-yield
bond returns of 11.92% (CSFB High Yield Index) and equity returns of 13.62% (S&P
500 Index).

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

The investment strategy employed in managing the Fund was designed to achieve
the Fund's objectives through entire economic and credit cycles. Many managers
of Senior Loan-based closed-end funds invest up to 20% or more of their
portfolios in high-yield bonds in order to boost yields in the short run. FCT,
on the other hand, is a "pure play" strategy that generally does not invest in
high-yield bonds, and focuses primarily on Senior Loans. In some market
environments, the Fund's pure play strategy will result in lower current
dividends/yields than some other Senior Loan-based closed-end funds with
meaningful allocations to high-yield bonds. However, we believe that our
investment strategy can result in lower NAV volatility while maintaining
competitive dividends/yields.

Our strategy focuses on thorough fundamental credit analysis, broad issuer and
industry diversification, and a proactive sell discipline in order to minimize
risk. The Fund's portfolio is generally more heavily weighted towards industry
groups that we expect to exhibit lower earnings volatility, and which we expect
to provide high recoveries to senior lenders in circumstances where earnings
volatility does occur. The Fund is broadly diversified with over 200 positions
across 30 industries. At May 31, 2007, the five largest individual borrower
exposures in total represented 10.3% of the Fund's portfolio.

                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned in prior reports, the Fund is leveraged using both adjustable-rate
Auction Market Preferred Shares and an asset-backed commercial paper conduit.
The terms and conditions of the leverage provide the Fund with the ability to
borrow on a floating-rate basis. Since the income generated by the Fund's Senior
Loan investment portfolio is also floating-rate, the Fund is less exposed to
interest rate mismatch risk than a closed-end fund with a fixed-rate investment
portfolio, and investors will generally benefit from portfolio leverage
regardless of short-term interest rates. 2 At May 31, 2007, the portfolio
leverage accounted for 41.7% of the Fund's total managed assets.

                                 SUB-ADVISOR Q&A

WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE MARKET AND THE FUND?

Despite the relatively low GDP growth in the first quarter, a rebound seems
underway in the second quarter of 2007. Signs of a rebound in GDP remain strong
as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing increased
dramatically in May. The non-manufacturing sector also appears to be robust and
construction was up in March and April. This, combined with a strong employment
market and three consecutive months of wage growth, drove consumer spending
growth to 4.4% in the first quarter.

WILL INFLATION AFFECT THE MARKET?

While the Fed took a hiatus from tightening for most of Fiscal 2007, it appears
to have a clear bias to keep inflation moderate. Consequently, if we continue to
see GDP expand in the second quarter of 2007 then we could likely see the Fed
begin to tighten again.

WILL SENIOR LOANS CONTINUE TO LOOK ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS?

Supply and demand have been robust and the forward calendar suggests that fiscal
year 2008 will benefit from continued merger and acquisition activity and
leveraged buyout volume. We would expect to see continued inflows into the
Senior Loan market as investors seek appealing risk-adjusted returns as compared
to other asset classes.

On April 16, 2007, Merrill Lynch produced a report on the Senior Loan Closed-End
Fund asset class and recommended FCT as a top pure play fund. 3

We remain committed to long-term performance and superior client support, and we
appreciate the opportunity to assist investors in meeting their investment
goals.

      therefore an increase in overall risk.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      (a)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on
            net assets applicable to Common Shareholders.

      (b)   Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- by
            Standard & Poor's Ratings Group are considered to be below
            investment grade.

      (c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
            prepayment. Prepayments of Senior Loans may occur because of the
            mandatory prepayment conditions and because there may be significant
            economic incentives for a borrower to optionally prepay. As a
            result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may be
            substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Senior Loans
            generally have maturities that range from five to eight years;
            however, the Fund estimates that refinancing and prepayments result
            in an average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio to
            be approximately 18-30 months.

      (d)   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at
            rates which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base
            lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally
            (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European banks,
            such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime
            rate offered by one or more major United States banks or (iii) the
            certificate of deposit rate.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2007

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets less any accrued
liabilities. The NAV is determined as of the close of regular trading on the
NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting
the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. The Fund
calculates NAV per Common Share by subtracting the Fund's liabilities (including
accrued expenses, dividends payable and any borrowings of the Fund) and the
liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred Shares from the Fund's Total
Assets (the value of securities and other investments the Fund holds plus cash
or other assets, including interest accrued but not yet received), and dividing
the result by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the principal markets for
particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities), but before
the Fund values its assets, would materially affect NAV, First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities
and investments. The use of fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as


                                                                         Page 23

determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than one securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such
value is being determined at the close of the exchange representing the
principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities traded in the
over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the NASDAQ, are

than 60 days are valued at amortized cost.

B. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS:

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts in order to hedge against
the risk of a fall in the capital price, or default, of debt securities it
holds. This involves the risk that the swap may expire worthless and the credit
risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment obligations to the Fund in
the event of a default. The Fund may only enter into such transactions with
counterparties rated A- or higher.

The Fund has entered into a credit default swap contract with the Fund being the
"seller" and the counterparty the "buyer" in this transaction. As a seller of
the credit default swap contract, the Fund receives from the counterparty a
periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract provided that no event
of default (e.g., grace period extension, obligation acceleration,
repudiation/moratorium, or restructuring) relating to the security occurs or
until the termination of the swap contract, whichever is first. If no event of
default occurs, the Fund will have received a series of periodic payments and
paid nothing of monetary value. If an event of default occurs, the Fund must pay
the counterparty the full notional value, or "par value," of the specified
security. Cash has been segregated for the full notional amount and appears on
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities under the heading "Cash segregated as
collateral for open credit default swaps".

Swaps are marked to market daily based upon quotations from brokers or market
makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) in the Fund's Statement of Operations. For a credit default swap
sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount made by the Fund in the
event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of
the referenced debt obligation purchased/received.

C. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

D. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid assets with a
current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments. At May 31, 2007, the Fund had no
when-issued or delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

E. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
approximately $8,809,715 as of May 31, 2007. The Fund is obligated to fund these
loan commitments at the borrower's discretion.

F. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. The Fund held restricted securities as shown in the
following table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities
be registered. These securities are valued using market quotations according to
the valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A)
and are not expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable
unrestricted security. There are no unrestricted securities with the same
maturity dates and yields for these issuers.

</TABLE>

G. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the year ended May 31,
2007, resulting in book and tax accounting differences have been reclassified at
year end to reflect an increase in undistributed net investment income by
$697,198 and an increase in accumulated net realized loss on investments sold by
$697,198. Net assets were not affected by this reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2007 and May 31, 2006 is as follows:

                                                      2007           2006
                                                  ------------   ------------

Distributions paid from:

Ordinary Income ...............................    $43,016,710    $36,953,889

As of May 31, 2007, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income .................    $ 2,802,736
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) ....    $(1,102,866)

H. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

Certain capital losses realized after October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2007, the fund has elected to defer capital losses occurring
between November 1, 2006 and May 31, 2007 in the amount of $69,023.

As of May 31, 2007, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward for federal income
tax purpose of $3,984,460, expiring on May 31, 2014.


                                                                         Page 25

                                  MAY 31, 2007

I. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

J. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes."
This pronouncement provides guidance on the recognition, measurement,
classification, and disclosures related to uncertain tax positions, along with
any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial statements has not yet
been determined.

In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
157 Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157") was issued by the FASB and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage, L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares, and the
principal amount of borrowings) minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid
dividends on any outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Trustees approved a revised compensation plan.
Under the revised plan, each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First
Trust, any sub-advisor or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is
paid an annual retainer of $10,000 per investment company for the first 14
investment companies of the First Trust Fund Complex and an annual retainer of
$7,500 per investment company of each subsequent investment company added to the
First Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of
the investment companies. No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with
board or committee meetings.

Additionally, Thomas R. Kadlec is paid $10,000 annually to serve as the Lead
Independent Trustee and Niel B. Nielson is paid $5,000 annually to serve as the
chairman of the Audit Committee with such compensation paid by the funds in the
First Trust Fund Complex and divided among those funds. Independent Trustees are
also reimbursed by the investment companies in the First Trust Fund Complex for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Trustees
adopted the revised plan because the increase in the number of funds in the
First Trust Fund Complex had the effect of rapidly increasing their compensation
under the previous arrangements. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Fund paid each
Independent Trustee an annual retainer of $10,000, which included compensation
for all board and committee meetings.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the year ended May 31, 2007, were $602,134,408 and
$580,576,420, respectively.

As of May 31, 2007, 25,291,939 of $0.01 par value Common Shares were issued. An
unlimited number of Common Shares have been authorized under the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan.

COMMON SHARE TRANSACTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS:

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of May 31, 2007, the Fund has
2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B AMP Shares outstanding at a liquidation value
of $25,000 per share.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of May 31, 2007 was 5.10% and 5.25% for
the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. The high and low annual dividend rates during the
year ended May 31, 2007, for the Series A 7 day auction were 5.31% and 4.80%,
respectively, and the average dividend rate was 5.09%. The high and low annual
dividend rates during the year ended May 31, 2007, for the Series B 28 day
auction were 5.31% and 4.98%, respectively, and the average dividend rate was
5.23%. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly to the income
received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to Common
Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund has entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit
Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be
used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of
July 30, 2007. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the
Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total
assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$195,000,000. For the year ended May 31, 2007, the average amount outstanding
was $172,857,534. The high and low annual interest rates during the year ended
May 31, 2007, were 5.36%


                                                                         Page 27

and 4.99%, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.27%. The
annual interest rate in effect at May 31, 2007 was 5.27%. The Fund also pays
additional borrowing costs, which include an administration fee of 0.02%, a
program fee of 0.20% and a liquidity fee of 0.14% per year. Such expenses are
included in "Interest and fees on outstanding loan payable" on the Statement of
Operations.

                             8. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject to investment risk,
including the possible loss of the entire principal invested. An investment in
Common Shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the
Fund. The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up
or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Common Shares at any point in time
may be worth less than the original investment, even after taking into account
the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions. Security prices can
fluctuate for several reasons including the general condition of the bond
market, or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur.

LOWER GRADE DEBT INSTRUMENTS: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally lower grade. These lower grade debt instruments may become the subject
of bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise subsequently default as to the repayment
of principal and/or payment of interest or be downgraded to ratings in the lower
rating categories. Lower grade debt instruments tend to be less liquid than
higher grade debt instruments.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. The funds borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing
program, or obtained through the issuance of Preferred Shares, constitute a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares, with
respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation. The Fund may not be
permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or Preferred Shares or purchase
Common Shares or Preferred Shares.

                        9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

On May 21, 2007, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.1268 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record June 5, 2007, payable June 15, 2007.

On June 20, 2007, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.1268 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record July 5, 2007, payable July 16, 2007.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR
FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of May 31, 2007, the related statement of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for the periods presented. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2007, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian and brokers; where replies were not received, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Fund as of May 31, 2007, the results of its operations and cash flows, the
changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights for the respective
stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PFPC
Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Plan. If you
elect to receive cash distributions, you will receive all distributions in cash
paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc., as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                      ADVISORY AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING CONTINUATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND
SUB-ADVISORY CONTRACTS

The Board of Trustees of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II (the "Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved
the continuation of the Investment Management Agreement (the "Advisory
Agreement") between the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") and
the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement" and together
with the Advisory Agreement, the "Agreements") among the Fund, the Advisor and
Four Corners Capital Management, LLC (the "Sub-Advisor"), at a meeting held on
March 12, 2007. The Board determined that the terms of the Agreements are fair
and reasonable and that the Agreements continue to be in the best interests of
the Fund.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as well as under
the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory
contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty
of investment advisers with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in voting
on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreements, the
Independent Trustees received a separate report from each of the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor in advance of the Board meeting responding to a request for
information from counsel to the Independent Trustees. The reports, among other
things, outlined the services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor
(including the


                                                                         Page 31

                                  MAY 31, 2007

relevant personnel responsible for these services and their experience); the
advisory and sub-advisory fees for the Fund as compared to fees charged by
investment advisors and sub-advisors to comparable funds and as compared to fees
charged to other clients of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor; expenses of the
Fund as compared to expense ratios of comparable funds; the nature of expenses
incurred in providing services to the Fund and the potential for economies of
scale, if any; financial data on the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor; any fall-out
benefits to the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor; and information on the Advisor's
and the Sub-Advisor's compliance programs. The Independent Trustees also met
separately with their independent legal counsel to discuss the information
provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor. The Board applied its business
judgment to determine whether the arrangements between the Fund and the Advisor
and among the Fund, the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor are reasonable business
arrangements from the Fund's perspective as well as from the perspective of
shareholders.

In reviewing the Agreements, the Board considered the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.
With respect to the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered that the Advisor is
responsible for the overall management and administration of the Fund, including
the oversight of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the compliance program that
had been developed by the Advisor and considered that the compliance program
includes policies and procedures for monitoring the Sub-Advisor's compliance
with the 1940 Act and the Fund's investment objectives and policies. With
respect to the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board received a presentation from
representatives of the Sub-Advisor discussing the services that the Sub-Advisor
provides to the Fund and how the Sub-Advisor meets the Fund's investment
objectives. In light of the information presented and the considerations made,
the Board concluded that the nature, quality and extent of services provided to
the Fund by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements have been and
are expected to remain satisfactory and that the Sub-Advisor has managed the
Fund consistent with its investment objectives and policies.

The Board considered the advisory and sub-advisory fees paid under the
Agreements. The Board reviewed data prepared by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), an
independent source, showing the management fees and expense ratios of the Fund
as compared to the management fees and expense ratios of one peer group selected
by Lipper and a second peer group selected by the Advisor. The Board discussed
with representatives of the Advisor the differences between the two peer groups
and the limitations in creating a relevant peer group for the Fund, including
the difficulties in comparing funds using different types of leverage. Based on
the information provided, the Board noted that the Fund's management fees were
in the third and fourth quintiles of the Lipper peer group and the Advisor peer
group, respectively, and that the Fund's expense ratio was in the fourth and
fifth quintiles of the Lipper peer group and the Advisor peer group,
respectively. The Board also considered the sub-advisory fee rate and how it
related to the overall management fee structure of the Fund and noted that the
Advisor pays the Sub-Advisor out of the advisory fees it receives from the Fund.
Finally, the Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor by similar
funds, and noted that the Advisor does not provide advisory services to clients
with investment objectives and policies similar to the Fund's other than another
closed-end fund. The Board also considered information provided by the
Sub-Advisor as to the fees it charges to other clients.

The Board also considered the Fund's performance for the one- and two-year
periods, as applicable, ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the performance
of a relevant benchmark index and to a performance universe selected by Lipper.
The Board noted that the Fund's performance was in the fourth quintile of the
performance universe for both periods and that the Fund outperformed its
benchmark for the one-year period. The Board also considered performance data
provided by the Advisor for the one-year and since inception periods, and
considered an analysis prepared by the Advisor on benefits provided by the
Fund's leverage. In addition, the Board considered the market price and net
asset value performance of the Fund since inception, and compared the Fund's
premium/discount to the average and median premium/discount of the Lipper peer
group, noting that the Fund's premium/discount was generally indicative of the
asset class. The Board concluded that the Fund's performance was reasonable,
particularly in light of the small number of funds managed in a similar "pure
play" style, without a high yield bond component.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, the Board concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory
fees were reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure but had not identified any economies of scale realized by the
Fund and had indicated that, because the Fund is a closed-end fund that is not
issuing more shares other than pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan, the
Advisor believed that any discussion of economies of scale was not meaningful.
The Board concluded that the management fee reflects an appropriate level of
sharing of any economies of scale. The Board also considered the costs of the
services provided and profits realized by the Advisor from serving as investment
manager to closed-end funds for the twelve months

ended December 31, 2006, as set forth in the materials provided to the Board.
The Board noted the inherent limitations in the profitability analysis, and
concluded that the Advisor's profitability appeared to be not unreasonable in
light of the services provided to the Fund. In addition, the Board considered
and discussed any ancillary benefits derived by the Advisor from its
relationship with the Fund and noted that the typical fall-out benefits to the
Advisor such as soft dollars are not present. The Board concluded that any other
fall out benefits received by the Advisor or its affiliates would appear to be
attenuated.

The Board considered that the Sub-Advisor's investment services expenses are
primarily fixed, and that the Sub-Advisor had added personnel in the past year
to improve the quality and consistency of services and anticipated continued
investments in personnel and systems. The Board considered that the sub-advisory
fee rate was negotiated at arm's length between the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor,
an unaffiliated third party. The Board also considered data provided by the
Sub-Advisor as to the profitability of the Sub-Advisory Agreement to the
Sub-Advisor, noting that the method used to allocate expenses was not a typical
practice of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the inherent limitations in this
profitability analysis and concluded that the profitability analysis for the
Advisor was more relevant, although the profitability of the Sub-Advisory
Agreement appeared to be not unreasonable in light of the services provided to
the Fund. The Board noted that the Sub-Advisor does not maintain any soft-dollar
arrangements and that the Sub-Advisor indicated that it does not receive any
material fall-out benefits from its relationship to the Fund.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the
Agreements continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of the
Agreements is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.

         Pursuant  to  its  charter  and  its  Audit  and   Non-Audit   Services
Pre-Approval  Policy  amended  as of  December  10,  2006 and  March  11,  2007,
respectively,  the Audit  Committee (the  "COMMITTEE")  is  responsible  for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted  non-audit services  (including
the  fees  and  terms  thereof)  to be  performed  for  the  registrant  by  its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the  Committee is authorized  to give such
pre-approvals  on behalf of the  Committee  up to  $25,000  and  report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

         The  Committee  is  also   responsible  for  the  pre-approval  of  the
independent  auditor's  engagements for non-audit services with the registrant's
adviser  (not  including  a  sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily   portfolio
management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another investment  adviser) and
any  entity  controlling,  controlled  by  or  under  common  control  with  the
investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant,  if the
engagement  relates  directly to the operations  and financial  reporting of the
registrant,  subject  to  the  DE  MINIMIS  exceptions  for  non-audit  services
described  in Rule  2-01 of  Regulation  S-X.  If the  independent  auditor  has
provided  non-audit  services  to  the  registrant's  adviser  (other  than  any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily  portfolio  management and is sub-contracted
with or  overseen by another  investment  adviser)  and any entity  controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the investment  adviser that provides
ongoing  services to the registrant that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to its
policies,  the Committee  will consider  whether the provision of such non-audit
services is compatible with the auditor's independence.


<PAGE>

  (e)(2) The percentage of services  described in each of paragraphs (b) through
         (d) for the registrant and the registrant's  investment adviser of this
         Item  that  were  approved  by  the  audit  committee  pursuant  to the
         pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph
         (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                           (b)  0%

                           (c)  0%

                           (d)  0%

(f)      The  percentage  of  hours  expended  on  the  principal   accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's  financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were  attributed  to work  performed by persons
         other than the principal  accountant's  full-time,  permanent employees
         was less than fifty percent.

(g)      The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services  rendered to the registrant,  and rendered to the registrant's
         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  registrant for 2006 were $19,492 and $90,602 for the registrant
         and the registrant's investment adviser, respectively and for 2007 were
         $11,186 and $65,072 for the registrant and the registrant's  investment
         adviser, respectively.

(h)      On February 21, 2007, the registrant's  audit committee of its Board of
         Trustees  determined that the provision of non-audit services that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

       all the independent trustees of the registrant.  The members of the audit

<PAGE>

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS, L.P.
                                FIRST TRUST FUNDS
                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors, L.P. (the "ADVISER") serves as investment adviser
providing  discretionary  investment  advisory  services  for  several  open  or
closed-end  investment companies (the "FUNDS").  As part of these services,  the
Adviser  has full  responsibility  for  proxy  voting  and  related  duties.  In
fulfilling  these  duties,  the  Adviser and Funds have  adopted  the  following
policies and procedures:

     1.    It is the  Adviser's  policy  to  seek to  ensure  that  proxies  for
           securities  held by a Fund are voted  consistently  and solely in the
           best economic interests of the respective Fund.

     2.    The Adviser shall be responsible  for the oversight of a Fund's proxy
           voting  process and shall  assign a senior  member of its staff to be
           responsible for this oversight.

     3.    The Adviser has engaged  the  services of  Institutional  Shareholder
           Services,  Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to the Adviser on the
           voting of proxies  related to securities held by a Fund. ISS provides
           voting recommendations based on established guidelines and practices.
           The Adviser has adopted these ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines.

     4.    The Adviser shall review the ISS  recommendations  and generally will
           vote  the   proxies   in   accordance   with  such   recommendations.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser may not vote in accordance
           with  the  ISS  recommendations  if the  Adviser  believes  that  the
           specific  ISS  recommendation  is not in the  best  interests  of the
           respective Fund.

     5.    If the Adviser  manages  the assets or pension  fund of a company and
           any of the Adviser's clients hold any securities in that company, the
           Adviser will vote proxies  relating to such  company's  securities in
           accordance  with the ISS  recommendations  to avoid any  conflict  of
           interest.  In  addition,  if the Adviser has actual  knowledge of any
           other type of material  conflict of interest  between  itself and the
           respective  Fund with  respect to the voting of a proxy,  the Adviser
           shall  vote  the  applicable   proxy  in  accordance   with  the  ISS
           recommendations to avoid such conflict of interest.

     6.    If a Fund requests the Adviser to follow specific  voting  guidelines
           or  additional  guidelines,  the Adviser shall review the request and
           follow  such  guidelines,  unless the Adviser  determines  that it is
           unable to follow such  guidelines.  In such case,  the Adviser  shall
           inform the Fund that it is not able to follow the Fund's request.

     7.    The  Adviser  may have  clients in  addition  to the Funds which have
           provided the Adviser with discretionary  authority to vote proxies on
           their  behalf.  In such  cases,  the  Adviser  shall  follow the same
           policies and procedures.

1. OPERATIONAL ITEMS
ADJOURN MEETING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to provide management with the authority to
adjourn an annual or special meeting absent compelling reasons to support the
proposal.

Vote FOR proposals that relate specifically to soliciting votes for a merger or
transaction if supporting that merger or transaction. Vote AGAINST proposals if
the wording is too vague or if the proposal includes "other business."

AMEND QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to reduce quorum requirements for shareholder meetings
below a majority of the shares outstanding unless there are compelling reasons
to support the proposal.

AMEND MINOR BYLAWS

Vote FOR bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping nature (updates or
corrections).

AUDITOR INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Consider the issue of auditor indemnification and limitation of liability on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. Factors to be assessed include, but are not limited to:

         The terms of the auditor agreement- the degree to which these
agreements impact shareholders' rights;

         Motivation and rationale for establishing the agreements; Quality of
         disclosure; and Historical practices in the audit area.

WTHHOLD against members of an audit committee in situations where there is
persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an inappropriate
indemnification agreement with its auditor that limits the ability of the
company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate legal recourse against the
audit firm.

AUDITOR RATIFICATION

Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

         An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company,
and is therefore not independent,

         There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an
opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's financial
position, or

         Fees for non-audit services ("Other" fees) are excessive.

Non-audit fees are excessive if:

Non-audit ("other") fees >audit fees + audit-related fees + tax compliance/
preparation fees

Tax compliance and preparation include the preparation of original and amended
tax returns, refund claims and tax payment planning. All other services in the
tax category, such as tax advice, planning or consulting should be added to
"Other" fees. If the breakout of tax fees cannot be determined, add all tax fees
to "Other" fees.

<PAGE>

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to prohibit or limit
their auditors from engaging in non-audit services.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for audit firm rotation,
taking into account: The tenure of the audit firm; The length of rotation
specified in the proposal; Any significant audit-related issues at the company;
The number of Audit Committee meetings held each year; The number of financial
experts serving on the committee; and Whether the company has a periodic renewal
process where the auditor is evaluated for both
audit quality and competitive price.

CHANGE COMPANY NAME

Vote FOR proposals to change the corporate name.

CHANGE DATE, TIME, OR LOCATION OF ANNUAL MEETING

Vote FOR management proposals to change the date, time, and/or location of the
annual meeting unless the proposed change is unreasonable.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to change the date, time, and/or location of
the annual meeting unless the current scheduling or location is unreasonable.

TRANSACT OTHER BUSINESS

Vote AGAINST proposals to approve other business when it appears as voting item.

         approval by a majority of the shares outstanding the previous year;

         shareholders tendered their shares;
o        At the previous board election, any director received more than 50

o        The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so
         that the full board functions as that committee;

         committee;

<PAGE>


o        The full board is less than majority independent.

WITHHOLD from the members of the Audit Committee if:

o        The non - audit fees paid to the auditor are excessive (see discussion
         under Auditor Ratification);
o        A material weakness identified in the Section 404 Sarbanes-Oxley Act

         internal control issues and an absence of established effective control
         mechanisms;
o        There is persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an
         inappropriate indemnification agreement with its auditor that limits
         the ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate
         legal recourse against the audit firm.

WITHHOLD from the members of the Compensation Committee if:

o        There is a negative correlation between the chief executive's pay and
         company performance (see discussion under Equity Compensation Plans);

or failure to replace management as appropriate.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOOTNOTES:

(1) "Affiliate" includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS
uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard for
applying its affiliate designation.

(2) "Executives" (officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934) include the chief executive, operating, financial, legal,
technology, and accounting officers of a company (including the president,
treasurer, secretary, controller, or any vice president in charge of a principal
business unit, division or policy function).

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        10

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 ISS will look at the terms of the interim CEO's employment contract to
determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits or
other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent,
non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was
underway for a full-time CEO at the time.

4 "Relative" follows the SEC's new definition of "immediate family members"
which covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings,
in-laws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household
of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant
shareholder of the company.

5 Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature and
generally include the following: investment banking/financial advisory services;
commercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment services; insurance
services; accounting/audit services; consulting services; marketing services;
and legal services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a
non-lead bank should be considered a transaction (and hence subject to the
associated materiality test) rather than a professional relationship.

6 If the company makes or receives annual payments exceeding the greater of
$200,000 or five percent of the recipient's gross revenues. (The recipient is
the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).

7 Interlocks include: (a) executive officers serving as directors on each
other's compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a
committee, on the board) or (b) executive officers sitting on each other's
boards and at least one serves on the other's compensation or similar committees
(or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board).

8 The operating involvement of the Founder with the company will be
considered. Little to no operating involvement may cause ISS to deem the Founder
as an independent outsider.

9 For purposes of ISS' director independence classification, "material" will be
defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal or otherwise) that a
reasonable person might conclude could potentially influence one's objectivity
in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on an
individual's ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of
shareholders.

         three years; and
o        No director received a WITHHOLD vote level of 35% or more of the votes
         cast in the previous election.

* Starting in 2007, the industry peer group used for this evaluation will change
from the 4-digit GICS group to the average of the 12 companies in the same

Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate entirely directors' and officers' liability
for monetary damages for violating the duty of care.

Vote AGAINST indemnification proposals that would expand coverage beyond just

Vote AGAINST proposals that would expand the scope of indemnification to provide
for mandatory indemnification of company officials in connection with acts that
previously the company was permitted to provide indemnification for at the
discretion of the company's board (i.e. "permissive indemnification") but that
previously the company was not required to indemnify.

Vote FOR only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a
director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if both of the following

If only the director's legal expenses would be covered.

vacancies.

INDEPENDENT CHAIR (SEPARATE CHAIR/CEO)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring the position of chair be
filled by an independent director unless there are compelling reasons to
recommend against the proposal, such as a counterbalancing governance structure.
This should include all of the following:

o        Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
         members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. (The role may
         alternatively reside with a presiding director, vice chairman, or
         rotating lead director; however the director must serve a minimum of
         one year in order to qualify as a lead director.) At a minimum these
         should include:

         - Presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not
           present, including executive sessions of the independent directors,
         - Serves as liaison between the chairman and the independent directors,
         - Approves information sent to the board,
         - Approves meeting agendas for the board,

         Two-thirds independent board;

o        All-independent key committees;

         basis*, unless there has been a change in the Chairman/CEO position
         within that time;
o        The company does not have any problematic governance issues.

* Starting in 2007, the industry peer group used for this evaluation will change
from the 4-digit GICS group to the average of the 12 companies in the same
6-digit GICS group that are closest in revenue to the company. To fail, the
company must under-perform its index and industry group on all 4 measures (1 and
3 year on industry peers and index).

MAJORI

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        13
<PAGE>



TY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS/ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMITTEES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of directors be
independent unless the board composition already meets the proposed threshold by
ISS' definition of independent outsider. (See Classification of Directors.)

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that board audit, compensation, and/or
nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors if they
currently do not meet that standard.

MAJORITY VOTE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Generally vote FOR precatory and binding resolutions requesting that the board
change the company's bylaws to stipulate that directors need to be elected with
an affirmative majority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the
state law where the company is incorporated. Binding resolutions need to allow
for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard when there are more nominees than
board seats.

Companies are strongly encouraged to also adopt a post-election policy (also
know as a director resignation policy) that will provide guidelines so that the
company will promptly address the situation of a holdover director.

OFFICE OF THE BOARD

Generally vote FOR shareholders proposals requesting that the board establish an
Office of the Board of Directors in order to facilitate direct communications
between shareholders and non-management directors, unless the company has all of
the following:

o        Established a communication structure that goes beyond the exchange
         requirements to facilitate the exchange of information between
         shareholders and members of the board;
o        Effectively disclosed information with respect to this structure to its
         shareholders;
o        Company has not ignored majority-supported shareholder proposals or a
         majority withhold vote on a director nominee; and
o        The company has an independent chairman or a lead/presiding director,
         according to ISS' definition. This individual must be made available
         for periodic consultation and direct communication with major
         shareholders.

OPEN ACCESS

Generally vote FOR reasonably crafted shareholder proposals providing
shareholders with the ability to nominate director candidates to be included on
management's proxy card, provided the proposal substantially mirrors the SEC's
proposed two-trigger formulation (see the proposed "Security Holder Director
Nominations" rule (HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV/RULES/PROPOSED/34-48626.HTM) or ISS'
comment letter to the SEC dated 6/13/2003, available on ISS website under
Governance Center- ISS Position Papers).

PERFORMANCE TEST FOR DIRECTORS

WITHHOLD from directors of Russell 3000 companies that underperformed relative
to their industry peers. The criterion used to evaluate such underperformance is
a combination of four performance measures:

One measurement will be a market-based performance metric and three measurements
will be tied to the company's operational performance. The market performance
metric in the methodology is five-year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) on a
relative basis within each four-digit GICS group. The three operational
performance metrics are sales growth, EBITDA growth, and pre-tax operating
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) on a relative basis within each four-digit
GICS group. All four metrics will be time-weighted as follows: 40 percent on the
trailing 12 month period and 60 percent on the 48 month period prior to the
trailing 12 months. This methodology emphasizes the company's historical
performance over a five-year period yet also accounts for near-term changes in a
company's performance.

<PAGE>

The table below summarizes the new framework: Adopt a two-phased approach. In
2007 (YEAR 1), the worst performers (bottom five percent) within each of the 24
GICS groups will automatically receive CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE, except for companies
that have already received cautionary language or withhold votes in 2006 under
the current policy. The latter may be subject to withhold votes in 2007. For
2008 (YEAR 2), WITHHOLD votes from director nominees if a company continues to
be in the bottom five percent within its GICS group for that respective year
and/or shows no improvement in its most recent trailing 12 months operating and
market performance relative to its peers in its GICS group. This policy would be
applied on a rolling basis going forward.

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While stock ownership on the part of directors is desired, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking that the company adopt a
holding or retention period for its executives (for holding stock after the
vesting or exercise of equity awards), taking into account any stock ownership
requirements or holding period/retention ratio already in place and the actual
ownership level of executives.

TERM LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors through term limits. However, scrutinize boards where the average
tenure of all directors exceeds 15 years for independence from management and
for sufficient turnover to ensure that new perspectives are being added to the
board.

3. PROXY CONTESTS

VOTING FOR DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the election of directors in contested elections,
considering the following factors:
Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
Management's track record; Background to the proxy contest;
Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);
Strategic plan of dissident slate and quality of critique against
management; Likelihood that the proposed goals and objectives can be
achieved (both slates); Stock ownership positions.

REIMBURSING PROXY SOLICITATION EXPENSES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses. When
voting in conjunction with support of a dissident slate, vote FOR the
reimbursement of all appropriate proxy solicitation expenses associated with the
election.

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that corporations adopt confidential
voting, use independent vote tabulators, and use independent inspectors of
election, as long as the proposal includes a provision for proxy contests as
follows: In the case of a contested election, management should be permitted to
request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy. If the
dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents will not agree,
the confidential voting policy is waived.

Vote FOR management proposals to adopt confidential voting.

4. ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSES AND VOTING RELATED ISSUES
ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS/NOMINATIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on advance notice proposals, supporting those proposals which
allow shareholders to submit proposals as close to the meeting date as
reasonably possible and within the broadest window possible.

AMEND BYLAWS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.
Vote FOR proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition
to shareholders.

POISON PILLS

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that the company submit its poison
pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it UNLESS the company has: (1) A
shareholder approved poison pill in place; or (2) The company has adopted a
policy concerning the adoption of a pill in the future specifying that the board
will only adopt a shareholder rights plan if either:

o        Shareholders have approved the adoption of the plan; or
o        The board, in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities,
         determines that it is in the best interest of shareholders under the
         circumstances to adopt a pill without the delay in adoption that would
         result from seeking stockholder approval (i.e. the "fiduciary out"
         provision). A poison pill adopted under this fiduciary out will be put
         to a shareholder ratification vote within twelve months of adoption or
         expire. If the pill is not approved by a majority of the votes cast on
         this issue, the plan will immediately terminate.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for poison pills to be put to a vote
within a time period of less than one year after adoption. If the company has no
non-shareholder approved poison pill in place and has adopted a policy with the
provisions outlined above, vote AGAINST the proposal. If these conditions are
not met, vote FOR the proposal, but with the caveat that a vote within twelve
months would be considered sufficient.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals on poison pill ratification, focusing
on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the
following attributes:

o        No lower than a 20% trigger, flip-in or flip-over;
o        A term of no more than three years;
o        No dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the
         ability of a future board to redeem the pill;
o        Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the board
         refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying offer is
         announced, ten percent of the shares may call a special meeting or seek
         a written consent to vote on rescinding the pill.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take
action by written consent. Vote FOR proposals to allow or make easier
shareholder action by written consent.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to call
special meetings. Vote FOR proposals that remove restrictions on the right of
shareholders to act independently of management.

SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote. Vote FOR
proposals to lower supermajority vote requirements.

5. MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS OVERALL APPROACH

For mergers and acquisitions, review and evaluate the merits and drawbacks of
the proposed transaction, balancing various and sometimes countervailing factors
including:

o        VALUATION - Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or
         paid by the acquirer) reasonable? While the fairness opinion may
         provide an initial starting point for assessing valuation
         reasonableness, emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market
         reaction and strategic rationale.

o        MARKET REACTION - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A
         negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal.

o        STRATEGIC RATIONALE - Does the deal make sense strategically? From
         where is the value derived? Cost and revenue synergies should not be
         overly aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable. Management
         should also have a favorable track record of successful integration of
         historical acquisitions.

o        NEGOTIATIONS AND PROCESS - Were the terms of the transaction negotiated
         at arm's-length? Was the process fair and equitable? A fair process
         helps to ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant
         negotiation "wins" can also signify the deal makers' competency. The
         comprehensiveness of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial
         auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder value.

o        CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction
         disproportionately and inappropriately as compared to non-insider
         shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and
         officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger
         than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether these
         interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support
         or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the "ISS
         Transaction Summary" section of this report is an aggregate figure that
         can in certain cases be a misleading indicator of the true value
         transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to be
         excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a
         potential conflict exists.

o        GOVERNANCE - Will the combined company have a better or worse
         governance profile than the current governance profiles of the
         respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is to
         change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that other
         issues (such as valuation) outweigh any deterioration in governance.

combined effect is positive, support such proposals.

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals regarding conversion of securities. When

o        Increases in capital structure;
o        Changes to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the company.

     Absent compelling financial reasons to recommend the transaction, vote
     AGAINST the formation of a holding company if the transaction would include
     either of the following:

o        Increases in common or preferred stock in excess of the allowable
         maximum (see discussion under "Capital Structure");
o        Adverse changes in shareholder rights.

transaction enhances shareholder value by taking into consideration:

o        Whether the company has attained benefits from being publicly-traded
         (examination of trading volume, liquidity, and market research of the
         stock);
o        Cash-out value;
o        Whether the interests of continuing and cashed-out shareholders are
         balanced; and

6. STATE OF INCORPORATION
CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION PROVISIONS

Control share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting
rights when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting
rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by
approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus,
control share acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put
its offer to a shareholder vote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder
continues buying up a large block of shares.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing
so would enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to
shareholders.

Vote AGAINST proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition
provisions.

Vote FOR proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.

CONTROL SHARE CASH-OUT PROVISIONS

Control share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to
"cash-out" of their position in a company at the expense of the shareholder who
has taken a control position. In other words, when an investor crosses a preset
threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares
to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share cash-out statutes.

DISGORGEMENT PROVISIONS

Disgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a
certain percentage of a company's stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company
any profits realized from the sale of that company's stock purchased 24 months
before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the acquirer
occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months)
prior to the investor's gaining control status are subject to these
recapture-of-profits provisions.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.

FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that
stipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it
paid to acquire the control shares), evaluating factors such as the vote
required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required to repeal the
fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.

Generally, vote AGAINST fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements
greater than a majority of disinterested shares.

FREEZE-OUT PROVISIONS

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of state freeze-out provisions. Freeze-out
provisions force an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a
company to wait a specified period of time before gaining control of the
company.

GREENMAIL

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market
value of its shares, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Vote FOR proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or
otherwise restrict a company's ability to make greenmail payments.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other
charter or bylaw amendments.

REINCORPORATION PROPOSALS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to change a company's state of incorporation,
taking into consideration both financial and corporate governance concerns,
including:
The reasons for reincorporating;
A comparison of the governance provisions;
Comparative economic benefits; and
A comparison of the jurisdictional laws.

Vote FOR re-incorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or
negative governance changes.

STAKEHOLDER PROVISIONS

Vote AGAINST proposals that ask the board to consider non-shareholder
constituencies or other non-financial effects when evaluating a merger or
business combination.

STATE ANTITAKEOVER STATUTES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to opt in or out of state takeover statutes
(including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out statutes,
freezeout provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill
endorsements, severance pay and labor contract provisions, anti-greenmail
provisions, and disgorgement provisions).

ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK

Vote FOR management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock.

COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance using a model developed by ISS.

Vote FOR proposals to approve increases beyond the allowable increase when a
company's shares are in danger of being delisted or if a company's ability to
continue to operate as a going concern is uncertain.

In addition, for capital requests less than or equal to 300 percent of the
current authorized shares that marginally fail the calculated allowable cap
(i.e., exceed the allowable cap by no more than 5 percent), on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, vote FOR the increase based on the company's performance and whether the
company's ongoing use of shares has shown prudence. Factors should include, at a
minimum, the following:

o        Rationale;
o        Good performance with respect to peers and index on a five-year total
         shareholder return basis;
o        Absence of non-shareholder approved poison pill;
o        Reasonable equity compensation burn rate;
o        No non-shareholder approved pay plans; and
o        Absence of egregious equity compensation practices.

DUAL-CLASS STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior
voting rights.

Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with dual-class capital structures to
increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock that has superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to create a new class of nonvoting or sub-voting common stock
if:

o        It is intended for financing purposes with minimal or no dilution to
         current shareholders;
o        It is not designed to preserve the voting power of an insider or
         significant shareholder.

ISSUE STOCK FOR USE WITH RIGHTS PLAN

Vote AGAINST proposals that increase authorized common stock for the explicit
purpose of implementing a non-shareholder approved shareholder rights plan
(poison pill).

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals that seek preemptive rights, taking
into consideration: the size of a company, the characteristics of its
shareholder base, and the liquidity of the stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other
rights ("blank check" preferred stock).

Vote FOR proposals to create "declawed" blank check preferred stock (stock that
cannot be used as a takeover defense).

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        25
<PAGE>

Vote FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and
the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.

Vote AGAINST proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred stock
authorized for issuance when no shares have been issued or reserved for a
specific purpose.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred
shares after analyzing the number of preferred shares available for issue given
a company's industry and performance in terms of shareholder returns.

RECAPITALIZATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on recapitalizations (reclassifications of securities), taking
into account the following:

o        More simplified capital structure;
o        Enhanced liquidity;
o        Fairness of conversion terms;
o        Impact on voting power and dividends;
o        Reasons for the reclassification;
o        Conflicts of interest; and
o        Other alternatives considered.

delisting.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to implement a reverse stock split that do not
proportionately reduce the number of shares authorized for issue based on the
allowable increased calculated using the Capital Structure model.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

Vote FOR management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans in
which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.

STOCK DISTRIBUTIONS: SPLITS AND DIVIDENDS

Vote FOR management proposals to increase the common share authorization for a
stock split or share dividend, provided that the increase in authorized shares
would not result in an excessive number of shares available for issuance as
determined using a model developed by ISS.

TRACKING STOCK

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the creation of tracking stock, weighing the strategic
value of the transaction against such factors as:

o        Adverse governance changes;
o        Excessive increases in authorized capital stock;
o        Unfair method of distribution;
o        Diminution of voting rights;

8. EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on equity-based compensation plans. Vote AGAINST the equity
plan if any of the following factors apply:

o        The total cost of the company's equity plans is unreasonable;
o        The plan expressly permits the repricing of stock options without prior
         shareholder approval;
o        There is a disconnect between CEO pay and the company's performance;
o        The company's three year burn rate exceeds the greater of 2% and the
         mean plus 1 standard deviation of its industry group; or
o        The plan is a vehicle for poor pay practices.

Each of these factors is further described below:

COST OF EQUITY PLANS

Generally, vote AGAINST equity plans if the cost is unreasonable. For
non-employee director plans, vote FOR the plan if certain factors are met (see
Director Compensation section).

The cost of the equity plans is expressed as Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT),
which is measured using a binomial option pricing model that assesses the amount
of shareholders' equity flowing out of the company to employees and directors.
SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value,
and includes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and
shares granted but unexercised. All award types are valued. For omnibus plans,
unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of awards (for
example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be
granted will be the most expensive types. See discussion of specific types of
awards.

The Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below the
company-specific allowable cap. The allowable cap is determined as follows: The
top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry
Classification Standard GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each
industry are established based on these top performers' historic SVT. Regression
analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly
correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or
downwards for the specific company by plugging the company-specific performance
measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive
at the company's allowable cap.

REPRICING PROVISIONS

Vote AGAINST plans that expressly permit the repricing of underwater stock
options without prior shareholder approval, even if the cost of the plan is
reasonable. Also, WITHHOLD from members of the Compensation Committee who
approved and/or implemented an option exchange program by repricing and buying
out underwater options for stock, cash or other consideration or canceling
underwater options and regranting options with a lower exercise price without
prior shareholder approval, even if such repricings are allowed in their equity
plan.

Vote AGAINST plans if the company has a history of repricing options without
shareholder approval, and the applicable listing standards would not preclude
them from doing so.

PAY-FOR PERFORMANCE DISCONNECT Generally vote AGAINST plans in which:

o        there is a disconnect between the CEO's pay and company performance (an
         increase in pay and a decrease in performance);
o        the main source of the pay increase (over half) is equity-based, and
o        the CEO is a participant of the equity proposal.

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        27
<PAGE>

Performance decreases are based on negative one- and three-year total
shareholder returns. CEO pay increases are based on the CEO's total direct
compensation (salary, cash bonus, present value of stock options, face value of
restricted stock, value of non-equity incentive payouts, change in pension value
and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings, and all other compensation)
increasing over the previous year.

WITHHOLD votes from the Compensation Committee members when the company has a
pay for performance disconnect.

On a CASE-BY-CASE basis, vote for equity plans and FOR compensation committee
members with a pay-for-performance disconnect if compensation committee members
can present strong and compelling evidence of improved committee performance.
This evidence must go beyond the usual compensation committee report disclosure.
This additional evidence necessary includes all of the following:

o        The compensation committee has reviewed all components of the CEO's
         compensation, including the following:

         - Base salary, bonus, long-term incentives;
         - Accumulative realized and unrealized stock option and restricted
           stock gains;
         - Dollar value of perquisites and other personal benefits to the CEO
           and the total cost to the company;
         - Earnings and accumulated payment obligations under the company's
           nonqualified deferred compensation program;
         - Actual projected payment obligations under the company's supplemental
           executive retirement plan (SERPs).

o        A tally sheet with all the above components should be disclosed for the
         following termination scenarios:

         -  Payment if termination occurs within 12 months: $_____;
         -  Payment if "not for cause" termination occurs within 12 months:
            $_____;
         -  Payment if "change of control" termination occurs within 12 months:
            $_____.

o        The compensation committee is committed to providing additional
         information on the named executives' annual cash bonus program and/or
         long-term incentive cash plan for the current fiscal year. The
         compensation committee will provide full disclosure of the qualitative
         and quantitative performance criteria and hurdle rates used to
         determine the payouts of the cash program. From this disclosure,
         shareholders will know the minimum level of performance required for
         any cash bonus to be delivered, as well as the maximum cash bonus
         payable for superior performance.

The repetition of the compensation committee report does not meet ISS'
requirement of compelling and strong evidence of improved disclosure. The level
of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where shareholders can
understand the mechanics of the annual cash bonus and/or long-term incentive
cash plan based on the additional disclosure.

o        The compensation committee is committed to granting a substantial
         portion of performance-based equity awards to the named executive
         officers. A substantial portion of performance-based awards would be at
         least 50 percent of the shares awarded to each of the named executive
         officers. Performance-based equity awards are earned or paid out based
         on the achievement of company performance targets. The company will
         disclose the details of the performance criteria (e.g., return on
         equity) and the hurdle rates (e.g., 15 percent) associated with the
         performance targets. From this disclosure, shareholders will know the
         minimum level of performance required for any equity grants to be made.
         The performance-based equity awards do not refer to non-qualified stock
         options(1) or performance-accelerated grants.(2) Instead,
         performance-based equity awards are performance-contingent grants where
         the individual will not receive the equity grant by not meeting the
         target performance and vice versa.

The level of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where
shareholders can understand the mechanics of the performance-based equity awards
based on the additional disclosure.

o        The compensation committee has the sole authority to hire and fire
         outside compensation consultants. The role of the outside compensation
         consultant is to assist the compensation committee to analyze executive
         pay packages or contracts and understand the company's financial
         measures.

THREE-YEAR BURN RATE/BURN RATE COMMITMENT

Generally vote AGAINST plans if the company's most recent three-year burn rate
exceeds one standard deviation in excess of the industry mean (per the following
Burn Rate Table) and is over two percent of common shares outstanding. The
three-year burn rate policy does not apply to non-employee director plans unless
outside directors receive a significant portion of shares each year.

However, vote FOR equity plans if the company fails this burn rate test but the
company commits in a public filing to a three-year average burn rate equal to
its GICS group burn rate mean plus one standard deviation (or 2%, whichever is
greater), assuming all other conditions for voting FOR the plan have been met.

If a company fails to fulfill its burn rate commitment, vote to WITHHOLD from
the compensation committee.

(1) Non-qualified stock options are not performance-based awards unless the
grant or the vesting of the stock options is tied to the achievement of a
pre-determined and disclosed performance measure. A rising stock market will
generally increase share prices of all companies, despite of the company's
underlying performance. (2) Performance-accelerated grants are awards that vest
earlier based on the achievement of a specified measure. However, these grants
will ultimately vest over time even without the attainment of the goal(s).

For companies that grant both full value awards and stock options to their
employees, ISS shall apply a premium on full value awards for the past three
fiscal years. The guideline for applying the premium is as follows:

POOR PAY PRACTICES

Vote AGAINST equity plans if the plan is a vehicle for poor compensation
practices.

WITHHOLD from compensation committee members, CEO, and potentially the entire
board, if the company has poor compensation practices. The following practices,
while not exhaustive, are examples of poor compensation practices that may
warrant withholding votes:

Egregious employment contracts (e.g., those containing multi-year guarantees for
bonuses and grants);
Excessive perks that dominate compensation (e.g., tax gross-ups for personal use
of corporate aircraft);
Huge bonus payouts without justifiable performance linkage or proper disclosure;
Performance metrics that are changed (e.g., canceled or replaced during the
performance period
without adequate explanation of the action and the link to performance);
Egregious pension/SERP (supplemental executive retirement plan) payouts
(e.g., the inclusion of additional years of service not worked or inclusion of
performance-based equity awards in the pension calculation);
New CEO awarded an overly generous new hire package (e.g., including excessive
"make whole" provisions or any of the poor pay practices listed in this policy);
Excessive severance provisions (e.g., including excessive change in control
payments);

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        31
<PAGE>

Change in control payouts without loss of job or substantial diminution of job
duties; Internal pay disparity;
Options backdating (covered in a separate policy);
and Other excessive compensation payouts or poor pay practices at the company.

SPECIFIC TREATMENT OF CERTAIN AWARD TYPES IN EQUITY PLAN EVALUATIONS:

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS

Options that have Dividend Equivalent Rights (DERs) associated with them will
have a higher calculated award value than those without DERs under the binomial
model, based on the value of these dividend streams. The higher value will be
applied to new shares, shares available under existing plans, and shares awarded
but not exercised per the plan specifications. DERS transfer more shareholder
equity to employees and non-employee directors and this cost should be captured.

LIBERAL SHARE RECYCLING PROVISIONS

Under net share counting provisions, shares tendered by an option holder to pay
for the exercise of an option, shares withheld for taxes or shares repurchased
by the company on the open market can be recycled back into the equity plan for
awarding again. All awards with such provisions should be valued as full-value
awards. Stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) will also be considered
as full-value awards if a company counts only the net shares issued to employees
towards their plan reserve.

OTHER COMPENSATION PROPOSALS AND POLICIES

401(K) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Vote FOR proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on compensation plans for non-employee directors, based on the
cost of the plans against the company's allowable cap.

On occasion, director stock plans that set aside a relatively small number of
shares when combined with employee or executive stock compensation plans exceed
the allowable cap. Vote for the plan if ALL of the following qualitative factors
in the board's compensation are met and disclosed in the proxy statement:

Director stock ownership guidelines with a minimum of three times the annual
cash retainer.

         o     Vesting schedule or mandatory holding/deferral period:
         -     A minimum vesting of three years for stock options or restricted
               stock; or
         -     Deferred stock payable at the end of a three-year deferral
               period.
         o     Mix between cash and equity:
         -     A balanced mix of cash and equity, for example 40% cash/60%
               equity or 50% cash/50% equity;

or

         -     If the mix is heavier on the equity component, the vesting
               schedule or deferral period should be more stringent, with the
               lesser of five years or the term of directorship.

No retirement/benefits and perquisites provided to non-employee directors; and
Detailed disclosure provided on cash and equity compensation delivered to each
non-employee director for the most recent fiscal year in a table. The column
headers for the table may include the following: name of each non-employee
director, annual retainer, board meeting fees, committee retainer,
committee-meeting fees, and equity grants.

DIRECTOR RETIREMENT PLANS

<PAGE>

Vote AGAINST retirement plans for non-employee directors.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to eliminate retirement plans for non-employee
directors.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)

Vote FOR proposals to implement an ESOP or increase authorized shares for
existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive
(more than five percent of outstanding shares).

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS-- QUALIFIED PLANS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on qualified employee stock purchase plans. Vote FOR employee
stock purchase plans where all of the following apply:
Purchase price is at least 85 percent of fair market value;
Offering period is 27 months or less; and
The number of shares allocated to the plan is ten percent or less of the
outstanding shares.

Vote AGAINST qualified employee stock purchase plans where any of the following
apply:
Purchase price is less than 85 percent of fair market value; or
Offering period is greater than 27 months; or
The number of shares allocated to the plan is more than ten percent of the
outstanding shares.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS-- NON-QUALIFIED PLANS

Vote CASE-by-CASE on nonqualified employee stock purchase plans. Vote FOR
nonqualified employee stock purchase plans with all the following features:
Broad-based participation (i.e., all employees of the company with the exclusion
of individuals with 5 percent or more of beneficial ownership of the company);
Limits on employee contribution, which may be a fixed dollar amount or expressed
as a percent of base salary;
Company matching contribution up to 25 percent of employee's contribution, which
is effectively a discount of 20 percent from market value;
No discount on the stock price on the date of purchase since there is a company
matching contribution.

Vote AGAINST nonqualified employee stock purchase plans when any of the plan
features do not meet the above criteria. If the company matching contribution
exceeds 25 percent of employee's contribution, evaluate the cost of the plan
against its allowable cap.

INCENTIVE BONUS PLANS AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY PROPOSALS (OBRA-RELATED COMPENSATION
PROPOSALS) Vote FOR proposals that simply amend shareholder-approved
compensation plans to include administrative features or place a cap on the
annual grants any one participant may receive to comply with the provisions of
Section 162(m).

Vote FOR proposals to add performance goals to existing compensation plans to
comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) unless they are clearly
inappropriate.

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        33
<PAGE>

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on amendments to existing plans to increase shares reserved
and to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the provisions of Section
162(m) as long as the plan does not exceed the allowable cap and the plan does
not violate any of the supplemental policies.

Generally vote FOR cash or cash and stock bonus plans that are submitted to
shareholders for the purpose of exempting compensation from taxes under the
provisions of Section 162(m) if no increase in shares is requested.

OPTIONS BACKDATING

In cases where a company has practiced options backdating, WITHHOLD on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis from the members of the compensation committee, depending on
the severity of the practices and the subsequent corrective actions on the part
of the board. WITHHOLD from the compensation committee members who oversaw the
questionable options grant practices or from current compensation committee
members who fail to respond to the issue proactively, depending on several
factors, including, but not limited to:

Reason and motive for the options backdating issue, such as inadvertent vs.
deliberate grant date changes;

Length of time of options backdating;
Size of restatement due to options backdating;
Corrective actions taken by the board or compensation committee,
such as canceling or repricing backdated options,
or recoupment of option gains on backdated grants;
Adoption of a grant policy that prohibits backdating, and creation of a fixed
grant schedule or window period for equity grants going forward.

OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAMS/REPRICING OPTIONS

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals seeking approval to exchange/reprice
options taking into consideration:

Historic trading patterns--the stock price should not be so volatile that the
options are likely to be back "in-the-money" over the near term;
Rationale for the re-pricing--was the stock price decline beyond management's
control? Is this a value-for-value exchange?
Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?
Option vesting--does the new option vest immediately or is there a black-out
period?
Term of the option--the term should remain the same as that of the replaced
option;
Exercise price--should be set at fair market or a premium to market;
Participants--executive officers and directors should be excluded.

If the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance,
then also take into consideration the company's three-year average burn rate. In
addition to the above considerations, evaluate the intent, rationale, and timing
of the repricing proposal. The proposal should clearly articulate why the board
is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time. Repricing
underwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company's stock price
demonstrates poor timing. Repricing after a recent decline in stock price
triggers additional scrutiny and a potential AGAINST vote on the proposal. At a
minimum, the decline should not have happened within the past year. Also,
consider the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise
price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options should be far
enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being
done to take advantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the
exercise price of surrendered options should be above the 52-week high for the
stock price.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

STOCK PLANS IN LIEU OF CASH

Vote CASE-by-CASE on plans which provide participants with the option of taking
all or a portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.

(C) 2006 INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.        34

price volatility should indicate if the options are likely to be back
"in-the-money" over the near term.

OPTION REPRICING

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

PAY FOR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals based on a case-by-case analysis that
requests the board establish a pay-for-superior performance standard in the
company's executive compensation plan for senior executives. The proposals call
for:
the annual incentive component of the plan should utilize financial performance
criteria that can be benchmarked against peer group performance, and provide
that no annual bonus be awarded based on financial performance criteria unless
the company exceeds the median or mean performance of a disclosed group of peer
companies on the selected financial criteria;
the long-term equity compensation component of the plan should utilize financial
and/or stock price performance criteria that can be benchmarked against peer
group performance, and any options, restricted shares, or other equity
compensation used should be structured so that compensation is received only
when company performance exceeds the median or mean performance of the peer
group companies on the selected financial and stock price performance criteria;
and
the plan disclosure should allow shareholders to monitor the correlation between
pay and performance.

Consider the following factors in evaluating this proposal:
What aspects of the company's annual and long -term equity incentive programs
are performance driven?
If the annual and long-term equity incentive programs are performance driven,
are the performance criteria and hurdle rates disclosed to shareholders or are
they benchmarked against a disclosed peer group?
Can shareholders assess the correlation between pay and performance based on the
current disclosure?
What type of industry and stage of business cycle does the company belong to?

PENSION PLAN INCOME ACCOUNTING

PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposal requesting that a significant amount
of future long-term incentive compensation awarded to senior executives shall be
performance-based and requesting that the board adopt and disclose challenging
performance metrics to shareholders, based on the following analytical steps:

First, vote FOR shareholder proposals advocating the use of performance-based
equity awards, such as performance contingent options or restricted stock,
indexed options or premium-priced options, unless the proposal is overly
restrictive or if the company has demonstrated that it is using a "substantial"
portion of performance-based awards for its top executives. Standard stock
options and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria to be
considered as performance-based awards. Further, premium-priced options should
have a premium of at least 25 percent and higher to be considered
performance-based awards.
Second, assess the rigor of the company's performance-based equity program. If
the bar set for the performance-based program is too low based on the company's
historical or peer group comparison, generally vote FOR the proposal.
Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target payout, vote FOR
the shareholder proposal due to program's poor design. If the company does not
disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity program, vote
FOR the shareholder proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the
test.

The triggering mechanism should be beyond the control of management; The amount
should not exceed three times base amount (defined as the average annual taxable
W-2 compensation during the five years prior to the year in which the change of
control occurs;
Change-in-control payments should be double-triggered, i.e., (1) after a change
in control has taken place, and (2) termination of the executive as a result of
the change in control. Change in control is defined as a change in the company
ownership structure.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS (SERPS)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary
benefits contained in SERP agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company's
executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered
under employee-wide plans.

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting to limit the executive
benefits provided under the company's supplemental executive retirement plan
(SERP) by limiting covered compensation to a senior executive's annual salary
and excluding of all incentive or bonus pay from the plan's definition of
covered compensation used to establish such benefits.

undertaken by regulators and the scientific community.

Vote AGAINST proposals to completely phase out GE ingredients from the company's

eliminate GE ingredients from the company's products. Such resolutions
presuppose that there are proven health risks to GE ingredients (an issue better
left to federal regulators) that outweigh the economic benefits derived from
biotechnology.

HANDGUNS

Generally vote AGAINST requests for reports on a company's policies aimed at
curtailing gun violence in the United States unless the report is confined to

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

         In general,  Four  Corners  seeks to allocate  the purchase and sale of
corporate  loans to  clients  in a fair and  equitable  manner  to  quickly  and
prudently  create a  well-constructed,  fully  invested  portfolio  of corporate
loans.  Since Four Corners' clients have varying  investment  restrictions,  and
because of the

<PAGE>

constraining  mechanics  of the  corporate  loan  market,  allocation  of trades
through  methods such as pro-rata  allocation are not feasible.  Therefore,  the
allocation  of  corporate  loan  purchases  and  sales to  various  accounts  is
generally  based on factors such as the  client's  investment  restrictions  and
objectives,  including expected liquidity and/or third party credit ratings, the
client's acceptance or rejection of prospective investments,  if applicable, and
the  relative  percentage  of  invested  assets of a client's  portfolio,  among
others.  Assets may be  disproportionately  allocated  to accounts  during their
initial  investment  (ramp up) period,  notwithstanding  that other accounts may
also have assets available for investment.  Such disproportionate  allocation to
accounts  during the  ramp-up  process  may have a  detrimental  effect on other
accounts.  Subject  to  the  foregoing,  whenever  Four  Corners'  clients  have
available  funds for investment,  investments  suitable and appropriate for each
will be  allocated  in a manner Four  Corners  believes to be equitable to each,
although such  allocation  may result in a delay in one or more client  accounts
being  fully  invested  that would not occur if an  allocation  to other  client
accounts  were  not  made.  Moreover,  it is  possible  that  due  to  differing
investment  objectives or for other reasons, Four Corners and its affiliates may
purchase  securities  or loans of an issuer for one client and at  approximately
the same time recommend  selling or sell the same or similar types of securities
or loans for another  client.  For these and other  reasons,  not all portfolios
will  participate in the gains or losses  experienced by other  portfolios  with
similar investment objectives.

(A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

         Portfolio   Manager  and  Management  Team  compensation  is  typically
comprised of a base salary and a bonus. There are no pre-determined  formulas to
determine base salaries or bonus amounts.  Currently, the registrant's Portfolio
Managers  are also Principals of Four Corners Capital Management,  and thus also
maintain  a  percentage  equity  ownership  of the  firm.  From  time  to  time,
individuals on the Management  Team may also be offered equity  ownership in the
firm.

         The Portfolio  Managers' and Management Team's compensation (e.g., base
salary and bonus) is determined  by the  profitability  of Four Corners  Capital
Management as a firm without  regard to the  performance  of any one  particular
fund. The Portfolio Managers and the Management Team have no direct incentive to
take undue risks when individual fund performance is lagging.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.       INTRODUCTION.

         This code of  conduct  is being  adopted  by the  investment  companies
advised by First Trust Advisors,  L.P.,  from time to time,  (the "FUNDS").  The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable  assets that are vital to the
Funds'  success.  Each officer of the Funds,  and officers and  employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters,  including each of the
Funds' senior financial  officers  ("SFOS"),  is responsible for conducting each
Fund's  business  in a manner  that  demonstrates  a  commitment  to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President),  the Controller (who is the principal accounting  officer),  and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer),  and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds,  First Trust Advisors,  L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted  Codes of Ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the  Investment  Company Act of
1940 (the "RULE  17J-1  CODE").  These  Codes of Ethics are  designed to prevent
certain  conflicts  of  interest  that may arise when  officers,  employees,  or
directors of the Funds and the  foregoing  entities know about present or future
Fund  transactions  and/or have the power to influence those  transactions,  and
engage in  transactions  with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise  take  advantage of their  position and  knowledge  with
respect to those  securities.  In an effort to prevent  these  conflicts  and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1,  the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions  and conduct that create  conflicts  of interest,  and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  was  designed  to  address  corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely  disclosing financial  information.  Under Section
406 of the Act, all public  companies  (including  the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent  future  situations  (such as  occurred in  well-reported  situations
involving  such  companies  as Enron and  WorldCom)  where a company  creates an
environment  in which  employees  are afraid to  express  their  opinions  or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds  have  chosen  to adopt a senior  financial  officer  Code of
Conduct to encourage  their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust  Advisors  or First Trust  Portfolios,  to act  ethically  and to question
potentially  unethical  or illegal  practices,  and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.

II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT.

         The purposes of this Code are:

                A. To promote honest and ethical conduct,  including the ethical
         handling of actual or apparent  conflicts of interest  between personal
         and professional relationships;

                B. To promote full, fair,  accurate,  timely, and understandable
         disclosure  in reports  and  documents  that the Funds  file  with,  or
         submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the Funds make;

                C. To promote  compliance  with  applicable  governmental  laws,
         rules and regulations;

                D. To encourage the prompt internal  reporting to an appropriate
         person of violations of the Code; and

                E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE.

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated Mitchell E. Mohr or other
appropriate  officer  designated by the President of the respective  Funds to be
the Compliance  Coordinator for the  implementation  and  administration  of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         The Funds have adopted  guidelines  under which its SFOs perform  their
duties.  However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or  distributor  who  participate  in the  preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                A. Act with honesty and integrity  and avoid  violations of this
         Code,  including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund
         in personal and professional relationships.

                B. Disclose to the Fund's  Compliance  Coordinator  any material
         transaction or relationship  that reasonably  could be expected to give
         rise to any  violations  of the  Code,  including  actual  or  apparent
         conflicts  of  interest  with  the  Fund.  You  should  disclose  these
         transactions  or  relationships  whether you are  involved or have only
         observed  the  transaction  or  relationship.  If it is not possible to
         disclose  the  matter  to the  Compliance  Coordinator,  it  should  be
         disclosed  to the  Fund's  Principal  Financial  Officer  or  Principal
         Executive Officer.

<PAGE>

                C.  Provide   information  to  the  Fund's  other  officers  and
         appropriate  employees of service  providers  (adviser,  administrator,
         outside auditor,  outside counsel,  custodian,  etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                D.  Endeavor  to  ensure  full,  fair,  timely,   accurate,  and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                E. Comply with the federal  securities laws and other applicable
         laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care, competence
         and diligence,  without misrepresenting material facts or allowing your
         independent judgment to be subordinated.

                G. Respect the  confidentiality  of information  acquired in the
         course of your work except  when you have Fund  approval to disclose it
         or where  disclosure  is otherwise  legally  mandated.  You may not use
         confidential  information  acquired  in the  course  of your  work  for
         personal advantage.

                H. Share and  maintain  skills  important  and  relevant  to the
         Fund's needs.

                I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your work
         environment.

                J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources employed
         or entrusted to you.

                K.  Record or  participate  in the  recording  of entries in the
         Fund's  books  and  records  that  are  accurate  to the  best  of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE.

         SFOs and other  parties  subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain  provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting   their  request  in  writing  to  the  Compliance   Coordinator  for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's  shareholders  to the  extent  required  by SEC  rules.  A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code,  however,  shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual  basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.     REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS.

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code MUST immediately  report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the  Audit  Committee  of the Fund  Board.  An  example  of a  possible  Code
violation  is the  preparation  and filing of  financial  disclosure  that omits
material  facts,  or that is accurate but is written in a way that  obscures its
meaning.

          B.  Because  service  providers  such  as  an  administrator,  outside
accounting  firm, and custodian  provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements,  you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal,  or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct.  You
should report these actions to the Compliance  Coordinator  even if you know, or
think,  that the  service  provider  has its own code of ethics  for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other  officers  or  employees  who  report  violations  or
suspected  violations  in good faith will not be subject to  retaliation  of any
kind.  Reported  violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.    VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this  Code,  regardless  of  whether  this Code  specifically  refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary  action,
up to and including  termination of  employment.  A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940,  state laws  relating to duties owed by Fund  directors and
officers,  and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material  misstatements  in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material  fact.  These  material
misstatements and omissions include financial  statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B.  Examples  of  criminal  violations  of the law  include  stealing,
embezzling,  misapplying  corporate  or bank  funds,  making  a  payment  for an
expressed  purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments,  whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to  influence  the judgment or actions
of political  candidates,  government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the  Funds'  activities.  The Funds must and will  report  all  suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.

              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
