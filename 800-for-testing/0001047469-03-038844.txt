EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUND as of September 30, 2003

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]
Thomas J. Fetter
President

In our shareholder reports, we refer frequently to "quality spreads" and their
important role in bond analysis. However, while followed closely by bond
analysts and portfolio managers, this aspect of municipal bond investing is
generally overlooked by individual investors. As part of our continuing
educational series, we thought it might be instructive to discuss quality
spreads and why they constitute a key variable for investors in the municipal
bond market.

QUALITY SPREADS: COMPENSATION FOR ADDED CREDIT RISK...

The term "quality spread" refers to the difference in yields between bonds of
varying quality but similar maturities. A bond rated BBB, for example, should
have a higher yield than an insured bond rated AAA because investors who buy
lower-quality bonds anticipate being paid for accepting a higher level of credit
risk. That risk premium comes in the form of higher yields. Spreads are
typically stated in basis points, or 1/100's of a percentage point. Thus, a bond
yielding 5.00% trades at a spread of 100 basis points (1.00%) over a bond that
yields 4.00%.

SPREAD FLUCTUATIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS...

Spreads fluctuate with changes in market conditions, with many factors
influencing spread relationships. The quality and type of bond are primary
factors. For example, an insured general obligation rated AAA - with no credit
risk - will trade at a significantly lower yield than a BBB-rated industrial
bond, which has a significantly higher credit risk. Naturally, a bond's price
will respond to changes that may impact - for better or worse - the underlying
fundamentals of an issuer. Remember, bond yields move in the opposite direction
of bond prices.

Another factor that influences spreads is supply. Assuming stable demand,
spreads are likely to widen if the supply for a specific issuer increases, as
the market must now digest a larger volume of bonds. Similarly, if supply
declines, spreads may narrow, as investors may be willing to pay more for a
credit that is increasingly scarce.

Finally, quality spreads may fluctuate with changes in the overall economy. For
example, spreads tend to narrow as the economy strengthens and the revenue
outlook improves. On the other hand, as the economy slows or enters recession,
spreads tend to widen, as investors become increasingly worried about the
direction of the economy and its impact on bonds with higher credit risk.

SPREADS CONSTITUTE A KEY FACTOR IN INVESTMENT DECISIONS...

Quality spreads play an important role in the investment decisions of municipal
bond portfolio managers. The widening of spreads may suggest a developing
opportunity. If spreads have widened appreciably, the investor may detect an
unusual opportunity in a lower-quality, higher-yielding bond. Conversely, if
lower-quality bonds have significantly outperformed high-quality bonds over a
period, the resulting narrowing of spreads may signal the need for caution. This
"spread compression" may prompt portfolio managers to upgrade their portfolios
with higher-quality bonds because they are no longer being adequately
compensated for the risk of owning lower-quality bonds.

While quality spreads are a key metric for municipal bond investors, they
represent just one of many factors considered in establishing a diversified bond
portfolio. At Eaton Vance, we realize that complex markets require intensive
research, a need that emphasizes once again the value of experienced,
professional portfolio management.

                     Sincerely,

                     /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS as of September 30, 2003

MARKET RECAP

While the pace of job growth was disappointing, the U.S. economy improved
noticeably in the year ended September 30, 2003. The passage of significant tax
legislation appeared to give consumer spending a boost. Capital spending, which
has lagged the recovery rate of past expansions, was at last showing signs of
recovery in late summer and early fall, as manufacturers of industrial equipment
reported stronger orders.

TECHNOLOGY, RETAILING AND CONSTRUCTION HAVE LED THE ECONOMY IN THE EARLY STAGES
OF RECOVERY...

A beginning recovery was evident in several key sectors of the economy.
Technology companies, especially semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers, have
reported robust demand. The manufacturing sector also saw a pickup in activity,
with industrial segments, such as machine tools, faring well, as factories began
to refit their plants. The retail sector - with the exception of weak auto sales
- - was very strong, as consumer confidence rose and tax cuts filtered into
consumers' pockets. Despite a rise in mortgage rates, residential construction
maintained its strong momentum, although the commercial side was quite sluggish.

WITH SLOW JOB GROWTH AND MANAGEABLE INFLATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS KEPT
INTEREST RATES LOW...

Gross Domestic Product expanded 3.3% in the second quarter of 2003, followed by
a 7.2% rise in the third quarter. However, despite the rebounding economy, the
labor market remained stagnant through much of the year - the nation's jobless
rate was 6.1% in September 2003. While large employers were slow to rehire, the
pace of layoffs slowed considerably. Job growth was stronger among temporary
agencies and smaller firms, which have generated the lion's share of new jobs in
recent years.

Core inflation has generally been contained. Prices for finished goods, consumer
staples and services have seen little change. However, prices for some
commodities have witnessed a sharp rise, including lumber, plywood, steel and
natural gas. Meanwhile, gasoline prices, which spiked dramatically during the
prime summer driving season, have since fallen back slightly. With inflation
largely held at bay, the Federal Reserve has maintained an accommodative
monetary policy. The Fed lowered its Federal Funds rate - a key short-term
interest rate barometer - to 1.00% in June.

However, while the decline in short-term interest rates helped revive the stock
market, longer-term interest rates moved slightly higher, prompting a bond
market pullback. Ten-year Treasury bond yields - which were at 3.59% at
September 30, 2002 - rose to 3.93% by September 30, 2003 in response to a
reviving economy. The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index had a total return of
3.89% for the year ended September 30, 2003.*

FACING RISING BUDGET SHORTFALLS, BELEAGUERED STATES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RAISE
TAXES...

Despite lower federal tax rates, the rationale for tax-exempt income has
remained intact. Many state governments have enacted income tax hikes and fee
increases to make up for revenue shortfalls and budget deficits. Thus, while one
portion of the tax burden has fallen, another portion has grown more onerous for
many taxpayers. For that reason, we believe that municipal bonds will continue
to present interesting investment opportunities and to merit a place in the
portfolios of tax-conscious investors.

INVESTMENT UPDATE

Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- - The U.S. economy gathered new momentum in 2003. Consumer-based sectors, such
  as retail, have mounted a recovery, housing remains relatively strong and
  manufacturing appears to be on the mend in many sections of the nation. The
  nation's jobless rate was 6.1% in September 2003, up from 5.6% a year ago.

- - The Fund's largest sector weighting was insured* transportation bonds. The
  nation's transportation infrastructure is undergoing a dramatic overhaul to
  meet the needs of the next century. The Fund's holdings included issues for
  rapid transit, toll roads and bridges, monorails and highways.

- - Insured general obligations (GOs)* were a significant commitment for the Fund.
  Amid an uncertain recovery, a weak revenue outlook has raised the specter of
  budget deficits for many state and cities. As a consequence, the insured* GO
  sector has drawn more attention from investors.

- - In a slow economic recovery, management emphasized public purpose bonds that
  are relatively immune to economic fluctuations. Consistent with that approach,
  the Fund had a large investment in insured* water and sewer bonds, whose
  revenues derive from non-discretionary water bill payments.

- - In a changing interest rate environment, management continued to fine-tune the
  Fund's coupon structure. Management was able to take advantage of an increase
  in retail demand to make these adjustments.

</Table>

THE FUND

- - Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Fund had a
  total return of -3.42% for the year ended September 30, 2003. That return was
  the result of a decrease in share price from $15.00 on September 30, 2002 to
  $13.58 on September 30, 2003 and the reinvestment of $0.908 in regular monthly
  dividends.(3)

- - Based on net asset value, the Fund had a total return of 5.67% for the year
  ended September 30, 2003. That return was the result of a decrease in net
  asset value per share from $14.81 on September 30, 2002 to $14.67 on September
  30, 2003, and the reinvestment of all distributions.

- - Based on the most recent dividend and a share price of $13.58, the Fund had a
  market yield of 6.68% at September 30, 2003.(4) The Fund's market yield is
  equivalent to a taxable yield of 10.28%.(5)

EATON VANCE INSURED CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL BOND FUND as of September 30, 2003

INVESTMENT UPDATE

Cynthia J. Clemson
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- - The California economy showed signs of a rebound in 2003, although the pace of
  recovery remained slow. Health care, hospitality and residential construction
  were the major sources of new jobs. Manufacturing remained sluggish, with
  technology still slow to gain traction. The state's September 2003 jobless
  rate was 6.4%, down from 6.7% a year ago.

- - Insured* transportation bonds were the Fund's largest sector weighting at
  September 30, 2003. Given the state's vast geography, the efficient transport
  of passengers and freight is a key segment of California's economy. The Fund's
  investments included issues for airport authorities, mass transit and toll
  bridges.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) were key components of the Fund. Given the
  state's budgetary issues, the insured* nature of the bonds added an additional
  measure of protection, and provided quality and a dependable revenue stream.

- - Insured* lease revenue/certificates of participation constituted significant
  investments. These issues provided financing for a broad range of public
  projects, including the Sacramento City Hall Redevelopment and the San Jose
  Civic Center.

- - Insured* special tax revenue bonds were a major commitment for the Fund. These
  issues provide municipalities an alternative financing method for the
  infrastructure, utilities and transportation projects that are needed to
  support California's population growth.

THE FUND

- - Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Fund had a
  total return of -4.54% for the year ended September 30, 2003. That return was
  the result of a decrease in share price from $15.00 on September 30, 2002 to

  dividends.(3)

- - Based on net asset value, the Fund had a total return of 2.58% for the year

  30, 2003, and the reinvestment of all distributions.

INVESTMENT UPDATE

Thomas J. Fetter
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- - The New York economy has showed positive trends in 2003. The mid-August power
  outage had only a minor impact on economic activity, mainly on retailers and
  temporary agencies. Manufacturing and port activity improved, while housing
  and hospitality markets remained strong. The state's September 2003 jobless
  rate was 6.4%, up from 6.0% a year ago.

- - Insured* transportation bonds were the Fund's largest sector weighting at
  September 30, 2003. Among the Fund's investments were bonds for thruways,
  bridges and tunnels, port authorities and the New York City mass transit
  authority.

- - While insured* hospital bonds constituted a large Fund weighting, management
  was very selective within the sector. In a very competitive market, the Fund
  focused on the state's top tier institutions, including New York Presbyterian
  Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering.

- - The Fund's insured* education bonds were deemed attractive for their stable
  tuition revenues. Investments included some of the state's most esteemed
  institutions, such as Rochester Institute of Technology, Rockefeller
  University and New York Medical College.

- - The Fund has continued to pursue broad diversification by sector, issuer and
  coupon distribution. In addition, amid a quickening pace of refundings, call
  protection remained a prime strategic consideration.

The Fund invests primarily in debt securities issued by California
municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their
obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or
municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such economic
developments, at September 30, 2003, 87.4% of the securities in the portfolio of
investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and
financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by
financial institutions ranged from 18.3% to 27.2% of total investments.

(1) Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
    requirements on open financial futures contracts.

be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality. In
order to reduce the risk associated with such economic developments, at
September 30, 2003, 84.8% of the securities in the portfolio of investments are
backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial
guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by financial
institutions ranged from 2.1% to 31.9% of total investments.

    requirements on open financial futures contracts.

(3) Net asset value at beginning of period reflects the deduction of the sales
    load of $0.675 per share paid by the shareholder from the $15.000 offering
    price.

(4) Total investment return on net asset value is calculated assuming a purchase
    at the offering price of $15.000 less the sales load of $0.675 per share
    paid by the shareholder on the first day and a sale at the net asset value
    on the last day of the period reported. Total investment return on market
    value is calculated assuming a purchase at the offering price of $15.000

    day and a sale at the current market price on the last day of the period
    reported. Total investment return on net asset value and total investment
    return on market value are not computed on an annualized basis.

(5) Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
    change in net asset value or market value with all distributions reinvested.
    Total return is not computed on an annualized basis.

(6) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
    reflect the Fund's leveraged capital structure.

(7) Annualized.

(8) Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
    preferred shares) from the Fund's total assets, and dividing this by the
    number of preferred shares outstanding.

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS as of September 30, 2003

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund (Insured Municipal Fund), Eaton Vance
   Insured California Municipal Bond Fund (Insured California Fund), and Eaton
   Vance Insured New York Municipal Bond Fund (Insured New York Fund),
   (individually referred to as the Fund or collectively the Funds) are
   registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), as
   amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies. The
   Insured Municipal Fund was organized under the laws of The Commonwealth of
   Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated July 2, 2002.
   The Insured California Fund and the Insured New York Fund were organized
   under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and
   Declaration of Trust dated July 8, 2002. Each Fund's investment objective is
   to achieve current income exempt from regular federal income tax, including
   alternative minimum tax, and taxes in its specified state. Each Fund seeks to
   achieve its objective by investing primarily in high grade municipal
   obligations that are insured as to the timely payment of principal and
   interest.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by each Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Futures contracts listed on the
   commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Interest rate
   swaps are normally valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a broker.
   Short-term obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at
   amortized cost, which approximates value. Investments for which valuations or
   market quotations are unavailable are valued at fair value using methods
   determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

   B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

   D FEDERAL TAXES -- Each Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable, if any, and
   tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore,
   no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At September 30,
   2003, the Funds, for federal income tax purposes, had capital loss carryovers
   which will reduce taxable income arising from future net realized gain on
   investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code and
   thus will reduce the amount of distributions to shareholders which would
   otherwise be necessary to relieve the Funds of any liability for federal
   income or excise tax. The amounts and expiration dates of the capital loss
   carryovers are as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
   FUND                                   AMOUNT             EXPIRES
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   <S>                                     <C>               <C>
   Insured Municipal Fund                  $  1,076,715      September 30, 2011
   Insured California Municipal Fund            672,504      September 30, 2011

   Insured New York Municipal Fund            1,251,495      September 30, 2011
</Table>

   Additionally, at September 30, 2003, Insured Municipal Fund, Insured
   California Fund and Insured New York Fund had net capital losses of
   $6,521,683, $4,261,210 and $164,124, respectively, attributable to security
   transactions incurred after October 31, 2002. These capital losses are
   treated as arising on the first day of each Fund's taxable year ending
   September 30, 2004.

   In addition, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable it to
   designate distributions from the interest income generated by its investments
   in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal income taxes
   when received by each Fund, as exempt-interest dividends.

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Funds in connection with the
   offerings of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a
   reduction of capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, a Fund is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the

                                       27
<Page>

   financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or received by a
   Fund (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily fluctuations in
   the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for book purposes as
   unrealized gains or losses by a Fund. A Fund's investment in financial
   futures contracts is designed for both hedging against anticipated future
   changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should interest rates move
   unexpectedly, a Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
   financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   G USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   H EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Funds. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT
   receives a fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average
   daily cash balances each Fund maintains with IBT. All significant credit
   balances used to reduce the Funds' custodian fees are reported as a reduction
   of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   Each Fund issued Auction Preferred Shares on October 29, 2002 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded
   as a reduction of the capital of the common shares of each Fund. Dividends on
   the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
   at the offering of each Fund's APS and have been reset every seven days
   thereafter by an auction. Special dividend periods were set on the following
   series:

</Table>

   The APS are redeemable at the option of each Fund at a redemption price equal
   to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
   payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if any Fund is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the Common Shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each Fund is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in each
   Fund's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each Fund pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auction.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   Each Fund intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payments of any dividends on any outstanding APS. Distributions are
   recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distribution to preferred shareholders are
   recorded daily and are payable at the end of each dividend period. Each
   dividend payment period for the APS is generally seven days. Insured
   Municipal Fund Series B and Series D shares and Insured New York Series A
   shares set a special dividend period of 364 days effective March 4, 2003,
   August 7, 2003 and August 4, 2003, respectively. Insured

                                       28

   Municipal Fund Series C shares set a special dividend period of 728 days
   effective August 6, 2003. Insured Municipal Fund Series B, Series C, Series D
   and Insured New York Fund Series A will pay each Series' accumulated
   dividends on the first business day of each month. The applicable dividend
   rate for APS on September 30, 2003 are listed below. For the year ended
   September 30, 2003, the amount of dividends each Fund paid to Auction
   Preferred shareholders and average APS dividend rates for such period were as

</Table>

   The Funds distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.65% of each
   Fund's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to each Fund.
   Except for Trustees of each Fund who are not members of EVM's organization,
   officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services to each Fund
   out of such investment adviser fee. For the year ended September 30, 2003,
   the fee was equivalent to 0.65% of each Fund's average weekly gross assets
   and amounted to $9,563,761, $3,147,936, and $2,310,673 for Insured Municipal
   Fund, Insured California Fund and Insured New York Fund, respectively. EVM
   also serves as the administrator of the Funds, but currently receives no
   compensation.

   In addition, EVM has contractually agreed to reimburse the Fund for fees and
   other expenses in the amount of 0.32% of average weekly gross assets of each
   Fund during the first five full years of each Fund's operations, 0.24% of
   average weekly gross assets of each Fund in year six, 0.16% in year seven and
   0.08% in year eight. For the year ended September 30, 2003, EVM contractually
   waived $4,723,082, $1,555,160 and $1,137,562 of its advisory fee for Insured
   Municipal Fund, Insured California Fund and Insured New York Fund,
   respectively.

   Certain officers and one Trustee of each Fund are officers of the above
   organization.

5  INVESTMENTS

   Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. Government securities and
   short-term obligations, for the year ended September 30, 2003 were as

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   Each Fund may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
   the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
   to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment each Fund
   has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily
   represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the
   risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related
   and offsetting transactions are considered.

   A summary of obligations under these financial instruments at September 30,
   2003 is as follows:

 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUND,
EATON VANCE INSURED CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL BOND FUND AND EATON VANCE INSURED NEW
YORK MUNICIPALS BOND FUND:

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Eaton Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund, Eaton
Vance Insured California Municipal Bond Fund, and Eaton Vance Insured New York
Municipal Bond Fund ("the Funds") as of September 30, 2003, the related
statements of operations for the year then ended, and the statement of changes
in net assets and financial highlights for the year then ended and the period
from the start of business, August 30, 2002 to September 30, 2002. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities held as of September 30, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received
from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights, referred to
above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund, Eaton Vance Insured California Municipal Bond
Fund, and Eaton Vance Insured New York Municipal Bond Fund at September 30,
2003, the results of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in
their net assets and their financial highlights for the year then ended and the
period from the start of business, August 30, 2002 to September 30, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Fund offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
automatically reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Fund. You may
elect to participate in the Plan by completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Application Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions
in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying
agent. On the distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is
equal to or less than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage
commissions then new Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be
determined by the greater of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market
price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased on the open market by the
Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or
not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Fund's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Fund. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquiries regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.
