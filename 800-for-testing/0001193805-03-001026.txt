MuniVest Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net
asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments,
net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the
form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the
per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to
benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped;
that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At the same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common Stock shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks
of leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. As of August 31, 2003, the percentage of the Fund's
total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 13.18%.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may also invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter
contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the
change in market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return
for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change
in market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or
taking physical custody of securities.

A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

Now more than half behind us, 2003 has been a meaningful year in many respects.
Perhaps the most significant development was the conclusion of all-out war in
Iraq. Although not especially sensitive to geopolitical events, the municipal
market has not been exempt from the general market excitement we have seen since
fighting gave way to restructuring in Iraq.

Municipal bond yields rose and fell in response to war fears, equity market
uncertainty, sub par economic growth, unemployment and deflation. By the end of
August, long-term municipal revenue bond yields stood at 5.4%, as measured by
the Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index. With many state deficits at record levels,
municipalities issued more than $390 billion in new long-term tax-exempt bonds
during the 12-month period ended August 31, 2003. The availability of bonds,
together with attractive yield ratios relative to U.S. Treasury issues, made
municipal bonds a popular fixed income investment alternative.

Against this backdrop, our portfolio managers continued to work diligently to
deliver on our commitment to provide superior performance within reasonable
expectations for risk and return. This included striving to outperform our peers
and the market indexes. With that said, remember also that the advice and
guidance of a skilled financial advisor often can mean the difference between
fruitful and fruitless investing. A financial professional can help you choose
those investments that will best serve you as you plan for your financial
future.

Finally, I am proud to premiere a new look to our shareholder communications.
Our portfolio manager commentaries have been trimmed and organized in such a way
that you can get the information you need at a glance, in plain language.
Today's markets are confusing enough. We want to help you put it all in
perspective. The report's new size also allows us certain mailing efficiencies.
Any cost savings in production or postage are passed on to the Fund and,
ultimately, to Fund shareholders.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment
assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years ahead.

                                                Sincerely,


                                                /s/ Terry K. Glenn

                                                Terry K. Glenn
                                                President and Director

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      The Fund was able to successfully weather bouts of excessive interest rate
volatility during the fiscal year and outperform its Lipper category.

Discuss the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

During the past 12 months, long-term fixed income bond yields generally rose.
For the first eight months of the period, bond yields traded in a relatively
broad range. Volatile equity markets, concerns over the Iraq conflict and a sub
par economic recovery, particularly weak employment trends, all combined to
foster a generally benign fixed income environment. By the end of April 2003,
long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields had declined approximately 20 basis points
(.20%) to 4.77%. Weaker economic activity and continued reductions in short-term
interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board pushed bond yields even lower in May
and June to 4.17%. Bond yields rose dramatically in July and August in response
to stronger-than-expected domestic economic growth and a consensus that the
Federal Reserve Board had finished lowering interest rates to revive economic
activity. At the end of August 2003, long-term U.S. Treasury yields stood at
5.22%, an increase of approximately 30 basis points over the past year.

Long-term tax-exempt bond yields also rose over the 12 months, although to a
lesser extent than U.S. Treasury obligations. Yield volatility was lower than
that seen in U.S. Treasury issues, as municipal bond prices typically are less
sensitive to worldwide geopolitical pressures on a daily and weekly basis. By
the end of August, long-term municipal revenue bond yields, as measured by the
Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, stood at 5.40%, an increase of 15 basis points
during the past year. During the 12-month period, the rise in tax-exempt bond
yields has been approximately half that seen in their taxable counterparts.

The municipal market's outperformance of the U.S. Treasury market during the
period has been especially impressive given the dramatic increase in new bond
issuance. Over the past 12 months, municipalities have issued more than $390
billion in new securities, an increase of nearly 20% versus last year's
issuance. Recent semi-annual issuance has, in fact, exceeded the annual issuance
seen during much of the mid-1990s. Historically low interest rates over the past
year have been used by state and local governments as an opportunity to finance
existing infrastructure needs and refinance outstanding, higher-couponed issues.
Current estimates for 2003 municipal bond new issuance are approximately $350
billion, similar to 2002's record high issuance.

As an asset class, municipal bonds have remained an attractive investment
alternative, especially relative to U.S. Treasury issues. At the end of August
2003, long-term tax-exempt bond yields were 90% - 94% of comparable U.S.
Treasury issues, well in excess of their recent historic average of 85% - 88%.
Current yield ratios have made municipal securities attractive to both retail
and institutional investors. We expect the tax-exempt market's favorable
technical position to remain stable in the near term, therefore, an increase in
bond issuance during the remainder of 2003 is not likely to significantly impact
the municipal bond market's performance. Looking ahead, while many investors are
concerned about how economic growth might affect bond prices and yield, we
believe moderate economic growth, especially within a context of negligible
inflationary pressure, should not greatly endanger the positive fixed income
environments tax-exempt products have enjoyed.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the year ended August 31, 2003, the Common Stock of MuniVest Fund, Inc. had
a net annualized yield of 6.62%, based on a year-end per share net asset value
of $9.54 and $.632 per share income dividends. Over the same period, the total
investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +4.79%, based on a change in
per share net asset value from $9.76 to $9.54, and assuming reinvestment of
$.629 per share ordinary income dividends.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2003, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +.18%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $9.86 to $9.54, and assuming reinvestment of $.318 per share ordinary
income dividends.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2003, the Fund's Auction Market
Preferred Stock had an average yield as follows: Series A, .98%; Series B, .89%;
Series C, .85%; Series D, 1.04%; and Series E, .93%.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's

Common Stock (as measured by the trading price of the Fund's shares on the
American Stock Exchange), and assuming reinvestment of dividends, please refer
to the Financial Highlights section of the Financial Statements included in this
report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment return based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

Over the past 12 months, the Fund outperformed its Lipper category of General
Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged), which had an average return of +3.26% for the
period. We established a neutral posture with respect to interest rates in 2002
and early 2003, and maintained that stance through the middle of the year. We
believe this positioning helped insulate the Fund from much of the interest rate
volatility experienced during the past six months. Our strategy of enhancing
yield by increasing the Fund's exposure to lower-rated investment-grade issues
also was beneficial to total return performance, as these issues helped to
increase the Fund's investment income stream. In addition, these lower-rated
issues have exhibited less price volatility than many general market issues in
recent months, which also served to enhance performance.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

In April and May, as market yields declined in response to weak economic growth
and the possibility of additional short-term interest rate changes by the
Federal Reserve Board, we adopted a slightly more defensive strategy, further
reducing the portfolio's interest rate sensitivity by lowering the Fund's
average maturity. This defensive positioning resulted in relative outperformance
as interest rates rose dramatically in July and August. We also continued to add
higher-yielding instruments to the portfolio whenever they were attractively
priced in an effort to help the Fund maintain its favorable dividend yield in
the coming months.

In terms of leverage, the Fund's borrowing costs remained in the low 1% range
during the period. These attractive funding levels, in combination with a steep
tax-exempt yield curve, have generated a significant income benefit to the
Fund's Common Stock shareholders. Further declines in the Fund's borrowing costs
would require significant easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve
Board. While such action is not expected, neither is an increase in short-term
interest rates. We expect short-term borrowing costs to remain near current
attractive levels for the coming months. However, should the spread between
short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of leverage will
decline, and as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. (For a
more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 2 of
this report to shareholders.)

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We ended the period with a neutral to slightly defensive posture with respect to
future interest rate movements. We continue to favor more defensive,
higher-couponed issues over the more interest-rate-sensitive securities. At the
close of the period, the Fund had modest cash reserves of about 4%.

Overall, the Fund is structured to perform better in stable or rising interest
rate environments. If yields decline to the recent lows seen in June, we would
expect to adopt a much stronger defensive strategy.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
may require the use of management accruals and estimates. The Fund determines
and makes available for publication the net asset value of its Common Stock on a
weekly basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on the American Stock Exchange
under the symbol MVF. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter markets and are valued at the most recent bid price on the
basis of yield equivalent as obtained by the Fund's pricing service from dealers
that make markets in the securities. Financial futures contracts and options
thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing prices as of
the close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are valued at the last
sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In the case of options traded
in the over-the-counter market, valuation is the last asked price (options
written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Forward interest rate swaps
are valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Fund from the
counterparty. Short-term investments with a remaining maturity of sixty days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Securities
and assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at
fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors of the Fund, including valuations furnished by a pricing service
retained by the Fund, which may utilize a matrix system for valuations. The
procedures of the pricing service and its valuations are reviewed by the
officers of the Fund under the general supervision of the Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movement and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Options -- The Fund is authorized to purchase and write call and put
      options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium
      received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability.
      The amount of the liability is subsequently marked to market to reflect
      the current market value of the option written.

      When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the
      related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from) the
      basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
      of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
      closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to
      the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent
      the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co. ("ML &
Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at
an annual rate of .50% of the Fund's average weekly net assets, including assets
acquired from the sale of Preferred Stock. For the year ended August 31, 2003,
FAM reimbursed the Fund in the amount of $33,163.

For the year ended August 31, 2003, the Fund reimbursed FAM $19,189 for certain
accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, PSI, and/or ML & Co.

Preferred Stock

Auction Market Preferred Stock ("AMPS") are redeemable shares of Preferred Stock
of the Fund with a par value of $.025 per share and a liquidation preference of
$25,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, that entitle their holders
to receive cash dividends at an annual rate that may vary for the successive
dividend periods for each series. The yields in effect at August 31, 2003 were
as follows: Series A, .70%; Series B, .77%; Series C, .70%; Series D, .70%; and
Series E, .80%.

The Fund pays commissions to certain broker-dealers at the end of each auction
at an annual rate ranging from .25% to .375% calculated on the proceeds of each
auction. For the year ended August 31, 2003, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Incorporated, an affiliate of FAM, received $240,542 as commissions.

*     On August 31, 2003, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $26,099,945, of which $8,420,062 expires in 2008 and $17,679,883 expires
      in 2009. This amount will be available to offset like amounts of any
      future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized gains is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      tax deferral of losses on straddles, the difference between book and tax
      amortization methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income
      securities.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The following description of the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required by Federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock otherwise elects,
all dividend and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested by
The Bank of New York (the "Plan Agent"), as agent for shareholders in
administering the Plan, in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund.
Holders of Common Stock who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of
record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name then to such
nominee) by The Bank of New York, as dividend paying agent. Such participants
may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive all distributions of
dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to The Bank
of New York, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by written notice if received by the Plan
Agent not less than ten days prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
termination will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend
or distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares an income dividend or capital gains distribution
(collectively referred to as "dividends") payable either in shares or in cash,
non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be acquired by
the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon the circumstances
described below, either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of Common Stock from the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii)
by purchase of outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market
("open-market purchases") on the American Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If on the
payment date for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the Common Stock
is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common Stock plus
estimated brokerage commissions (such conditions being referred to herein as
"market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly
issued shares on behalf of the participant. The number of newly issued shares of
Common Stock to be credited to the participant's account will be determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
current market price per share on the date of issuance may not exceed 5%. If on
the dividend payment date the net asset value per share is greater than the
market value (such condition being referred to herein as "market discount"), the
Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the
participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the Plan Agent
will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no event more than 30 days after the
dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest the dividend amount
in shares acquired in open-market purchases. It is contemplated that the Fund
will pay monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which
open-market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date on the
dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date, which typically
will be approximately ten days. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
open-market purchases, the market price of a share of Common Stock exceeds the
net asset value per share, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan
Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisitions of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in newly issued
shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to open-market purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is
unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the
purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market purchases and will
invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at
the close of business on the last purchase date determined by dividing the
uninvested portion of the dividend by the net asset value per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all
proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold shares
of others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan
on the basis of


22      MUNIVEST FUND, INC.                     AUGUST 31, 2003
<PAGE>

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (concluded)

the number of shares certified from time to time by the record shareholders as
representing the total amount registered in the record shareholder's name and
held for the account of beneficial owners who are to participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the
Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains distributions payable either in
shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any Federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not available to
shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the market price plus commissions
of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants in the Plan will
receive shares of the Fund at less than they could otherwise purchase them and
will have shares with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market price plus
commissions is below the net asset value, participants will receive
distributions in shares with a net asset value greater than the value of any
cash distribution they would have received on their shares. However, there may
be insufficient shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be excluded
from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would be
excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a premium
over net asset value, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a
greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible
that all or a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the fair
market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable distribution. If
the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also possible that the
taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all the shareholders,
including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders
who do not participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary
income a portion of their distributions equal to their allocable share of the
discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right
to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
The Bank of New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY
10286-1258, Telephone: 800-432-8224.

Important Tax Information (unaudited)

All of the net investment income distributions paid by MuniVest Fund, Inc.
during the taxable year ended August 31, 2003 qualify as tax-exempt interest
dividends for Federal income tax purposes.

Please retain this information for your records.

Managed Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more consistent yield to the current trading price of shares
of Common Stock of the Fund, the Fund may at times pay out less than the entire
amount of net investment income earned in any particular month and may at times
in any particular month pay out such accumulated but undistributed income in
addition to net investment income earned in that month. As a result, the
dividends paid by the Fund for any particular month may be more or less than the
amount of net investment income earned by the Fund during such month. The Fund's
current accumulated but undistributed net investment income, if any, is
disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which comprises part of the financial
information included in this report.

MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level of
current income exempt from Federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment-grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which is exempt from Federal income taxes in the opinion of bond counsel to
the issuer.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to the
shareholders of MuniVest Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase of
shares of the Fund or any securities mentioned in the report. Past performance
results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. The Fund has leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Statements and other information herein
are as dated and are subject to change.

Item 7 - For closed-end funds that contain voting securities in their portfolio,

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that the Investment Adviser considers
         the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not the
         interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that real
         (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Investment
         Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's clients are
         properly addressed and resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a
         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except
         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested
         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting
         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

<PAGE>

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.
