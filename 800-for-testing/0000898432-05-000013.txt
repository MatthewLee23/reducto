CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds, for the period ending October 31, 2004.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Funds' investments
and their audited financial statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide current income exempt from
regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific Fund, current income
exempt from that state's income taxes.

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds (maturities between three and
eight years) because our experience and research indicate strongly that this
maturity range has historically offered the best risk/reward profile on the
yield curve, providing much of the return of longer-term bonds -- with less
volatility and risk.

We believe that our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax-exempt current income over
the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to keep earning it.

Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS Portfolio Commentaries

     We are pleased to report that on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, all three
     of Neuberger Berman's Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds delivered
     positive returns and materially outperformed the Lehman Brothers 10 Year
     Municipal Bond Index benchmark in fiscal 2004.

     In fiscal 2004, two difficult months (April and May) for municipal
     securities -- and bonds in general -- were sandwiched between two
     five-month periods of stable returns. This reflected investors' changing
     perspective on the economy. From November 2003 until March 2004, investors
     questioned the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery. In
     early April, the release of a strong March jobs report convinced investors
     the recovery was for real, and bond prices started to fall. An impressive
     April jobs report released at the beginning of May kept the pressure on
     bond prices through the end of the month. Then in June, the tide turned.
     Rapidly rising oil prices caused the economy to hit what Federal Reserve
     Chairman Greenspan characterized as a "soft patch." In addition, concern
     that terrorists would target the Olympics or U.S. targets during the
     presidential campaign caused a flight to quality. Bonds continued to rally
     through the end of the reporting period, with the yield on an AAA-rated
     10-year general obligation municipal bond falling from 4.06% at the end of
     May to 3.46% on October 29.

     Looking ahead, we believe that the outlook for municipal bonds is
     favorable, but we remain cautious. Increased tax revenue resulting from the
     recovering economy has improved state and local government balance sheets.
     However, this is being offset to varying degrees by the reduction in
     federal subsidies to municipalities, prompted by the growing federal budget
     deficit. Consequently, analysis of municipal securities' credit quality
     remains critical. Also, President Bush's election victory is likely to
     increase speculation about the potential for a flat tax and/or national
     sales tax replacing the graduated income tax. If this "chatter" gets loud
     enough, it could have a negative impact on the municipal securities market.
     However, despite the Republicans' new dominance at the federal level, we
     think it will once again prove difficult to build the substantial support
     required to approve a major tax overhaul. Consequently, we believe that any
     pressure on municipal securities prices due to discussion of tax reform
     will represent a good buying opportunity.

     (AMEX: NBH)

     For the six months ending October 31, 2004, on a net asset value (NAV)

     on an NAV basis the Fund returned 10.91% versus the benchmark's 6.35%.

     As of October 31, 2004, the portfolio was composed of 73.6% revenue bonds,
     24.1% general obligation bonds, 0.5% prerefunded/escrowed bonds and 1.8%

     is an initial public offering and once issued, common shares of closed-end

     an NAV basis, the Fund returned 10.97% versus the benchmark's 6.35%.

     As of October 31, 2004, the portfolio was composed of 87.1% revenue bonds,
     10.9% general obligation bonds, and 2.0% cash and cash equivalents. Bonds
     subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) equaled 13.0% of assets. At
     the close of the reporting period, the Fund's duration was 6.0 years and
     the portfolio's leverage position was 36.6% of assets.

     Shortly after the close of first-half fiscal 2004, California successfully
     issued $7.9 billion in Economic Recovery Bonds. The issue was
     over-subscribed at prices reflecting investor confidence that California
     will effectively address its structural budget deficit.

     months, on an NAV basis, the Fund returned 9.67% versus the benchmark's
     6.35%.

          valued has other securities outstanding. Short-term debt securities
          with less than 60 days until maturity may be valued at cost which,
          when combined with interest earned, approximates market value.

     @    At time of investment, municipal securities purchased by the Funds are
          within the four highest rating categories (with respect to at least
          80% of total assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical
          rating organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
          Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where not
          rated, are determined by the Funds' investment manager to be of
          comparable quality. Approximately 79%, 74%, and 54% of the municipal
          securities held by California, Intermediate, and New York,
          respectively, have credit enhancement features backing them, which the
          Funds may rely on, such as letters of credit, insurance, or
          guarantees. Without these credit enhancement features the securities
          may or may not meet the quality standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded
          bonds are supported by securities in escrow issued or guaranteed by
          the U.S. Government, its agencies, or instrumentalities. The amount
          escrowed is sufficient to pay the periodic interest due and the
          principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give the Funds the right to
          sell back the issue on the date specified.

     ++   Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

     **   Security exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.
          These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
          registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under Rule
          144A and are deemed liquid. At October 31, 2004, these securities
          amounted to $2,571,000 or 0.8% of net assets for Intermediate.

     *    Credit ratings are unaudited.

     ^^   Not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds

          NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
          ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
          ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal
          Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", collectively, the
          "Funds") were organized as Maryland corporations on July 29, 2002.
          California and New York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end
          management investment companies and Intermediate is registered as a
          diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
          Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Each Fund's Board of
          Directors may classify or re-classify any unissued shares of capital
          stock into one or more classes of preferred stock without the approval
          of shareholders.

          The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
          generally accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman
          Management Inc. ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at
          the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
          those estimates.

     2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in
          the notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

     3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions
          are recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income, including
          accretion of discount (adjusted for original issue discount, where
          applicable) and amortization of premium, where applicable, is recorded
          on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from securities
          transactions are recorded on the basis of identified cost and stated
          in the Statements of Operations.

     4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: Each Fund is treated as a separate entity for
          U.S. Federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to
          continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying
          with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
          applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
          substantially all of its earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no
          Federal income or excise tax provision is required.

          Income dividends and capital gain distributions are determined in
          accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from
          generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are
          primarily due to differing treatments of income and gains on various
          investment securities held by each Fund, timing differences and
          differing characterization of distributions made by each Fund as a
          whole.

          As determined on October 31, 2004, there were no permanent differences
          resulting from different book and tax accounting reclassified at year
          end.

          The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October
          31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

          As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings
          (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as
          follows:

          The difference between book basis and tax basis is attributable
          primarily to timing differences of dividend payments.

          To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be
          offset by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund
          not to distribute such gains. As determined at October 31, 2004, the
          Funds had unused capital loss carryforwards available for Federal
          income tax purposes to offset net realized capital gains, if any, as
          follows:

     5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income,
          net of expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of each
          Fund to declare and pay dividends to common shareholders from net
          investment income on a monthly basis. Distributions from net realized
          capital gains, if any, are normally distributed in December. Income
          dividends and capital gain distributions to common shareholders are
          recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividends and distributions to
          preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note
          A-7.

          Subsequent to October 31, 2004, each Fund declared two monthly
          dividends to common shareholders from its net investment income
          payable December 15, 2004 and January 18, 2005, to shareholders of
          record on November 26, 2004 and December 27, 2004, respectively, with
          ex-dividend dates of November 23, 2004 and December 22, 2004,
          respectively, as follows:

</TABLE>

     6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
          Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund.
          Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
          includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which
          Management serves as investment manager, that are not directly
          attributed to a Fund, are allocated among the Funds and the other
          investment companies in the complex or series thereof, on the basis of
          relative net assets, except where a more appropriate allocation of
          expenses to each investment company in the complex or series thereof
          can otherwise be made fairly.

</TABLE>

          All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of
          $25,000 per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends, whether or
          not earned or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon
          ("Liquidation Value"). Dividends to AMPS shareholders, which are
          cumulative, are accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay
          dividends every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28 days
          for each Fund's AMPS Series B, unless in a special rate period.

          In the absence of a special rate period, dividend rates are reset
          every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an
          auction. Each Fund has approved a special rate period for its AMPS
          Series A of 728 days for California and New York and 546 days for
          Intermediate. The effective dates and dividend rates for each Fund are

          The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in
          part, on the second business day preceding any dividend payment date
          at Liquidation Value.

          The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the
          AMPS. Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the
          Funds from declaring any distributions to common shareholders or
          repurchasing common shares and/or could trigger the mandatory
          redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value.

          The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote
          with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the AMPS
          will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law
          or the Funds' charter. The holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a
          separate class, are entitled at all times to elect two Directors of
          the Fund, and to elect a majority of the Directors of a Fund if the
          Fund failed to pay dividends on AMPS for two consecutive years.

     8    ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay
          all organizational expenses and the amount by which each Fund's
          offering costs for common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03
          per share. The costs incurred by management were $261,029, $276,501,
          and $289,752 for California, Intermediate and New York, respectively.
          Offering costs for common stock paid by each Fund were charged as a
          reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the completion of each
          Fund's offerings and amounted to $203,759, $620,459, and $167,159 for
          California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

          Additionally, offering costs of $154,612, $337,770, and $143,704 and
          sales loads of $590,000, $1,794,000, and $482,500 for AMPS for
          California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, were charged as
          a reduction of common stock paid-in capital for each Fund's AMPS
          offering.

     9    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt
          securities held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected
          by economic developments, including those particular to a specific
          industry or region. The investment policies of California and New York
          involve investing substantially all of their assets in municipal bonds
          of issuers located in the state of California and the state of New
          York, respectively. This policy makes those Funds more susceptible to
          adverse economic, political, regulatory or other factors affecting the
          issuers of such municipal bonds than a fund that does not limit its
          investments to such issuers.

     10   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Funds' organizational
          documents provide that their officers and directors are indemnified
          against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
          duties to the Funds. In addition, both in some of their principal
          service contracts and in the normal course of their business, the
          Funds enter into contracts that provide indemnifications to other
          parties for certain types of losses or liabilities. Each Fund's
          maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this could
          involve future claims against each Fund.

          NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
          WITH AFFILIATES:

          Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a
          Management Agreement. For such investment management services, each
          Fund pays Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its

                                       33
<PAGE>

          average daily Managed Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of
          the Fund, less liabilities other than the aggregate indebtedness
          entered into for purposes of leverage. For purposes of calculating
          Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value of any AMPS outstanding is not
          considered a liability.

          Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the
          management fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the
          following annual rates:

          Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond
          October 31, 2011.

          For the year ended October 31, 2004, such waived fees amounted to
          $396,184, $1,212,644, and $324,473 for California, Intermediate, and
          New York, respectively.

          Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an
          Administration Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an administration
          fee at the annual rate of 0.30% of its average daily Managed Assets
          under this agreement. Additionally, Management retains State Street
          Bank and Trust Company ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under
          a Sub-Administration Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for
          all services received under the agreement.

          On October 31, 2003, Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC
          ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and
          sub-adviser to each Fund, became indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of
          Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly-owned holding company.
          Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with investment
          recommendations and research information without added cost to each
          Fund. Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of each
          Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

          Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
          custodian contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected in the
          Statements of Operations under the caption Custodian fees, was a
          reduction of $498, $610, and $524 for California, Intermediate, and
          New York, respectively.

          In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund
          pays, through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
          broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the
          AMPS held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding
          a rate period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the
          annual rate of 1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of
          one year or more, the service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each
          Fund and the broker-dealer.

                                       34

          Each Fund has paid Merrill Lynch a fee equal to 1/8 of 1% in
          connection with entering the special rate periods in return for which
          Merrill Lynch had agreed to pay dividends on the AMPS that, as a
          result of the auction, exceed a specified rate.

          In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, each Fund is
          required to provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis
          verifying that each Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a
          discounted value equal to or greater than the Preferred Shares Basic
          Maintenance Amount, which is a minimum level set by each rating agency
          as one of the conditions to maintain the AAA rating on the AMPS.
          'Discounted value' refers to the fact that the rating agencies require
          the Fund, in performing this calculation, to discount portfolio
          securities below their face value, at a rate depending on their
          rating. Each Fund pays a fee to State Street, as Fund
          sub-administrator, for the preparation of this report.

     obtained under each Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may

ended October 31, 2004 and financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2004, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers or other appropriate auditing
procedures where replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each
of Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger
Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and Neuberger Berman New York
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. at October 31, 2004, the results of their
operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of
the two years in the period ended October 31, 2004, and their financial
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (Unaudited)

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

                                       41

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

objectivity of the Registrant's  financial  statements and the independent audit
thereof;  (c) to oversee,  or, as  appropriate,  assist Board  oversight of, the
Registrant's  compliance with legal and regulatory  requirements  that relate to
the  Portfolios'  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  internal  controls and
independent  audits;  (d) to approve prior to appointment  the engagement of the
Registrant's  independent auditors and, in connection  therewith,  to review and
evaluate the  qualifications,  independence  and performance of the Registrant's
independent  auditors;  and (e) to act as a  liaison  between  the  Registrant's
independent  auditors  and the full  Board.  The  Audit  Committee  is  composed
entirely of Independent Fund Directors;  its members are John Cannon,  Cornelius
T. Ryan (Chairman), Tom D. Seip, and Peter P. Trapp.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The  complete  schedule  of  investments  for each  series is  disclosed  in the
Registrant's Annual Report, which is included as Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board has  delegated  to  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger  Berman") the
responsibility  to vote  proxies  related to the  securities  held in the Fund's
portfolios.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by the Board to
vote proxies  related to portfolio  securities in the best interests of the Fund
and its  stockholders.  The Board  permits  Neuberger  Berman to contract with a
third party to obtain proxy voting and related services,  including  research of
current issues.

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger  Berman has voting  authority,  including the Fund. The Proxy
Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman  addresses any conflicts that
may arise  between its  interests and those of its clients with respect to proxy
voting.

<PAGE>

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.

ITEM 8.  PURCHASES OF EQUITY  SECURITIES  BY  CLOSED-END  MANAGEMENT  INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS

No reportable purchases for the period covered by this report.

ITEM 9.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no changes to the  procedures  by which  shareholders  may  recommend
nominees to the Board.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)   Based on an  evaluation  of the  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as
      defined in rule  30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as
      amended  (the  "Act")) as of a date  within 90 days of the filing  date of
      this  document,  the Chief  Executive  Officer and Treasurer and Principal
      Financial and  Accounting  Officer of the  Registrant  have concluded that
      such disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure

<PAGE>

      that information required to be disclosed by the Registrant is accumulated
      and communicated to the Registrant's  management to allow timely decisions
      regarding required disclosure.

(b)   There were no significant  changes in the Registrant's  internal  controls
      over financial  reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that
      occurred  during  the   Registrant's   last  fiscal  half-year  that  have
      materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially  affect, the
      Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 11. EXHIBITS

(a)(1)  A  copy  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  is   incorporated  by  reference  to
        Registrant's  Form N-CSR,  Investment  Company Act file number 811-21334
        (filed January 9, 2004).

(a)(2)  The certifications  required by Rule 30a-2(a) of the Act and Section 302
        of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  ("Sarbanes-Oxley  Act") are attached

(b)     The  certification  required by Rule 30a-2(b) of the Act and Section 906
        of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is attached hereto.

The  certifications  provided pursuant to Section 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act
are not deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.
Such  certifications will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any
filing  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 or the  Exchange  Act,  except to the
extent that the Registrant specifically incorporates them by reference.
