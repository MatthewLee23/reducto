A Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder

Financial markets weathered intense bouts of volatility in 2007, only to enter
2008 with no relief. January and February proved to be trying months for
equities, but strong ones for some areas of the bond market, as fears of an
economic recession swelled. The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed"), after cutting
the target federal funds rate 100 basis points (1%) between September 2007 and
year-end, more than matched those cuts in January alone. Responding to a slowing
economy and continued fallout from chaos in the credit markets, the Fed cut
interest rates 75 basis points in a rare unscheduled session on January 22, and
followed with a 50-basis-point cut at its regular meeting on January 30. Another
75-basis-point cut on March 18 brought the target rate to 2.25%.

Reverberations from the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse, and the associated
liquidity and credit crisis, continue to permeate global financial markets. The
S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks was down in February, marking the fourth
consecutive month of negative returns. International markets, while not
unscathed, generally have outperformed their U.S. counterparts so far in 2008.
Emerging markets, benefiting from stronger economic growth rates, have done
particularly well. In fixed income markets, fears related to the economic
slowdown and related credit crisis have led to a prolonged flight to quality.
Investors have largely shunned bonds associated with the housing and credit
markets in favor of higher-quality government issues. The yield on 10-year
Treasury issues, which touched 5.30% in June 2007 (its highest level in five
years), fell to 4.04% by year-end and to 3.53% by the end of February, while
prices correspondingly rose.

After setting a new-issuance record in 2007, supply in the municipal bond market
has been on the decline for four consecutive months (measured year over year).
The market has struggled with concerns around the creditworthiness of monoline
bond insurers and the failure of auctions for auction rate securities, driving
yields higher and prices lower across the curve. By period-end, municipal bonds
were trading at higher yields than their Treasury counterparts, a very unusual
occurrence by historical standards.

Against this backdrop, the major benchmark indexes posted mixed results for the
current reporting period, generally reflecting heightened investor risk
aversion:

Fund Summary as of February 29, 2008

Investment Objective

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (DSU) seeks to provide current income by
investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies' debt
instruments, including corporate loans, that are rated in the lower rating
categories of the established rating services (Ba or lower by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or BB or lower by Standard & Poor's) or unrated debt instruments
of comparable quality.

Performance

For the year ended February 29, 2008, the Fund returned -17.13% based on market
price, with dividends reinvested. The Fund's return based on net asset value
("NAV") was -11.72%, with dividends reinvested. For the same period, the Lipper
High Current Yield Funds (Leveraged) category posted a return of -16.04% on a
NAV basis. Fund performance was hampered by an overweight investment in
CCC-rated issues, whose spreads widened more than higher-rated securities during
the period. The Fund's large leverage position (approximately 25% of total
assets invested) and the poor performance of bank loans also were significant
detractors from performance.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") utilizes leverage through
borrowings or issuance of short-term debt securities. The concept of leveraging
is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from leverage
will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be lower than
the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio investments. To the
extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the assets obtained from
leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio investments, the Fund's
Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for Common Stock shareholders including the likelihood of
greater NAV and market price volatility. In addition, there is the risk that
fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings may reduce the Common Stock's yield
and negatively impact its NAV and market price. If the income derived from
securities purchased with assets received from leverage exceeds the cost of
leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater than if leverage had not been
used. Conversely, if the income from the securities purchased is not sufficient
to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be less than if
leverage had not been used, and therefore the amount available for distribution
to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking physical custody
of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party with whom the
Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to pay the Fund
and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the
other party to the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The Fund's financial statements are
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which may require the use of management accruals and
estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Fund determines
and makes available for publication the net asset value of its Common Stock on a
daily basis.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

Valuation of Investments: The Fund values most of its corporate bond investments
on the basis of last available bid price or current market quotations provided
by dealers or pricing services selected under the supervision of the Fund's
Board of Directors (the "Board"). In determining the value of a particular
investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to
transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, market transactions
in comparable investments, various relationships observed in the market between
investments, and calculated yield measures based on valuation technology
commonly employed in the market for such investments.

Floating rate loans are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
Board. Floating rate loan interests are valued at the mean between the last
available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan
Pricing Corporation ("LPC"). For the limited number of floating rate loans for
which no reliable price quotes are available, such floating rate loans may be
valued by LPC through the use of pricing matrixes to determine valuations. If
the pricing service does not provide a value for floating rate loans, BlackRock
Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc., will value the floating rate loans at fair value, which is
intended to approximate market value.

Equity investments traded on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ
Global Market System are valued at the last reported sale price that day or the
NASDAQ official closing price, if applicable. Equity investments traded on a
national securities exchange for which there were no sales on that day and
equity investments traded on other over-the-counter ("OTC") markets for which
market quotations are readily available are valued at the last available bid
price. Effective September 4, 2007, exchanged-traded options are valued at the
mean between the last bid and ask prices at the close of the options market in
which the options trade and previously were valued at the last sales price as of
the close of the options trading on applicable exchanges. OTC options quotations
are provided by dealers or pricing services selected under the supervision of
the Board. Considerations utilized by dealers or pricing services in valuing OTC
options include, but are not limited to, volatility factors of the underlying
security, price movement of the underlying security in relation to the strike
price and the time left until expiration of the option. Swap agreements are
valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Fund's pricing service.
Short-term securities may be valued at amortized cost.

In the event that application of these methods of valuation results in a price
for an investment which is deemed not to be representative of the market value
of such investment, the investment will be valued by, under the direction of, or
in accordance with, a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value
("Fair Value Assets"). When determining the price for Fair Value Assets, the
Advisor and/or sub-advisor seeks to determine the price that the Fund might
reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset in an
arm's-length transaction. Fair value determinations shall be based upon all
available factors that the Advisor and/or sub-advisor deems relevant. The
pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a
committee thereof.

Generally, trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at
various times prior to the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE"). The values of such securities used in computing the net assets of the
Fund are determined as of such times. Foreign currency exchange rates will be
determined as of the close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events
affecting the values of such securities and such exchange rates may occur
between the times at which they are determined and the close of business on the
NYSE that may not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's net assets. If
events (for example, a company announcement, market volatility or a natural
disaster) occur during such periods that are expected to materially affect the
value of such securities, those securities will be valued at their fair value as
determined in good faith by the Board or by the Advisor using a pricing service
and/or procedures approved by the Board.

Floating Rate Loans: The Fund invests in floating rate loans, which are
generally non-investment grade, made by banks, other financial institutions and
privately and publicly offered corporations. Floating rate loans generally pay
interest at rates that are periodically determined by reference to a base
lending rate plus a premium. The base lending rates are generally (i) the
lending rate offered by one or more European banks, such as LIBOR (London
InterBank Offered Rate), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more U.S. banks
or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. The Fund considers these investments
to be investments in debt securities for purposes of its investment policies.

The Fund earns and/or pays facility and other fees on floating rate loans. Other
fees earned/paid include commitment, amendment, consent, commissions and
prepayment penalty fees. Facility, amendment and consent fees are typically
amortized as premium and/or accreted as discount over the term of the loan.
Commitment, commission and various other fees are recorded as income. Prepayment
penalty fees are recorded as gains or losses. When the Fund buys a floating rate
loan it may receive a facility fee and when it sells a floating rate loan it may
pay a facility fee. On an

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

ongoing basis, the Fund may receive a commitment fee based on the undrawn
portion of the underlying line of credit portion of a floating rate loan. In
certain circumstances, the Fund may receive a prepayment penalty fee upon the
prepayment of a floating rate loan by a borrower. Other fees received by the
Fund may include covenant waiver fees and covenant modification fees.

The Fund may invest in multiple series or tranches of a loan. A different series
or tranche may have varying terms and carry different associated risks.

Floating rate loans are usually freely callable at the issuer's option. The Fund
may invest in such loans in the form of participations in loans
("Participations") and assignments of all or a portion of loans from third
parties. Participations typically will result in the Fund having a contractual
relationship only with the lender, not with the borrower. The Fund will have the
right to receive payments of principal, interest and any fees to which it is
entitled only from the lender selling the Participation and only upon receipt by
the lender of the payments from the borrower.

In connection with purchasing Participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement
relating to the loans, nor any rights of offset against the borrower, and the
Fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan in which
it has purchased the Participation.

As a result, the Fund will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the
lender that is selling the Participation. The Fund's investments in loan
participation interests involve the risk of insolvency of the financial
intermediaries who are parties to the transactions. In the event of the
insolvency of the lender selling the Participation, the Fund may be treated as a
general creditor of the lender and may not benefit from any offset between the
lender and the borrower.

Preferred Stock: The Fund may invest in preferred stocks. Preferred stock has a
preference over common stock in liquidation (and generally in receiving
dividends as well) but is subordinated to the liabilities of the issuer in all
respects. As a general rule, the market value of preferred stock with a fixed
dividend rate and no conversion element varies inversely with interest rates and
perceived credit risk, while the market price of convertible preferred stock
generally also reflects some element of conversion value. Because preferred
stock is junior to debt securities and other obligations of the issuer,
deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer will cause greater changes in
the value of a preferred stock than in a more senior debt security with similar
stated yield characteristics. Unlike interest payments on debt securities,
preferred stock dividends are payable only if declared by the issuer's board of
directors. Preferred stock also may be subject to optional or mandatory
redemption provisions.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise if the value of the contract decreases due to an
unfavorable change in the price of the underlying security, or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Credit default swaps -- The Fund may invest in credit default swaps, which
      are OTC contracts in which one party pays fixed periodic payments to a
      counterparty in consideration for a guarantee from the counterparty to
      make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place. These
      periodic payments received or made by the Fund are recorded in the
      accompanying Statement of Operations as realized gains or losses,
      respectively. Gains or losses are also realized upon termination of the
      swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market daily and changes in value are
      recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Risks arise from the
      possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their
      contracts. The Fund is exposed to credit loss in the event of
      non-performance by the other party to the swap.

      The Fund may utilize credit default swaps for the purpose of reducing the
      interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio and decreasing the Fund's
      exposure to interest rate risk.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. Forward currency contracts, when used by the Fund,
      help manage the overall exposure to the foreign backing some of the
      investments help by the Fund. The contract is marked-to-market daily and
      the change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain
      or loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

Foreign Currency Transactions: Foreign currency amounts are translated into
United States dollars on the following basis: (i) market value of investment
securities, assets and liabilities at the current rate of exchange; and (ii)
purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the rates
of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.

The Fund reports foreign currency related transactions as components of realized
gains for financial reporting purposes, whereas such components are treated as
ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.

Income Taxes: It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax laws, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

Effective August 31, 2007, the Fund implemented Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48
prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in
connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or
expected to be taken by an entity, including investment companies, before being
measured and recognized in the financial statements. The Advisor has evaluated
the application of FIN 48 to the Fund, and has determined that the adoption of
FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements. The
Fund files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax
returns are currently under examination. The statute of limitations on the
Fund's U.S. federal tax returns remain open for the years ended February 28,
2005 through February 28, 2007. The statutes of limitations on the Fund's state
and local tax returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon the
jurisdiction.

Investment Transactions and Investment Income: Investment transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are deter-mined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

Dividends and Distributions: Dividends from net investment income are declared
and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the ex-dividend
dates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2006, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The impact on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures, if any, is currently being assessed.

In addition, in February 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
("FAS 159"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that
choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
liabilities. The impact on the Fund's financial statement disclosure, if any, is
currently being assessed.

Segregation: In cases in which the 1940 Act and the interpretive positions of
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") require that the Fund segregate
assets in connection with certain investments (e.g., swaps), the Fund will,
consistent with certain interpretive letters issued by the SEC, designate on its
books and records cash or other liquid debt securities having a market value at
least equal to the amount that would otherwise be required to be physically
segregated.

Deferred Compensation and BlackRock Closed-End Share Equivalent Investment Plan:
Under the deferred compensation plan approved by the Fund's Board,
non-interested Directors ("Independent Directors") defer a portion of their
annual complex-wide compensation. Deferred amounts earn an approximate return as
though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in common shares of other
certain BlackRock Closed-End Funds selected by the Independent Directors. This
has approximately the same economic effect for the Independent Directors as if
the Independent Directors had invested the deferred amounts directly in other
certain BlackRock Closed-End Funds.

The deferred compensation plan is not funded and obligations thereunder
represent general unsecured claims against the general assets of the Fund. Each
Fund may, however, elect to invest in common shares of other certain BlackRock
Closed-End Funds selected by the Independent Directors in order to match its
deferred compensation obligations. Investments to cover the Fund's deferred
compensation liability are included in other assets on the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities.

Other: Expenses that are directly related to one of the Funds are charged to
that Fund. Other operating expenses are pro-rated to certain Funds on the basis
of relative net assets.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Other Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Advisor to
provide investment advisory and administration services. Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. are principal
owners of BlackRock, Inc.

The Advisor is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays the Advisor a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.60% of the average daily
value of the Fund's net assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings
used for leverage. In addition, the Advisor has entered into a sub-advisory
agreement with BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. ("BFM"), an affiliate of the
Advisor, under which the Advisor pays BFM for services it provides a monthly fee
that is a percentage of the management fee paid by the Fund to the Advisor. For
the year ended February 29, 2008, the Fund reimbursed the Advisor $12,728 for
certain accounting services, which are included in accounting services expenses
in the Statement of Operations.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales (including paydowns) of investments, excluding short-term
securities, for the year ended February 29, 2008 were $496,066,365 and
$613,647,072, respectively.

4. Capital Stock Transactions:

The Fund is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value
$0.10, all of which were initially classified as Common Stock. The Board is
authorized, however, to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of capital
stock without approval of the holders of Common Stock.

Shares issued and outstanding during the years ended February 29, 2008 and
February 28, 2007 increased by 332,989 and 579,550, respectively, as a result of
dividend reinvestment.

5. Commitments:

The Fund may invest in floating rate loans. In connection with these
investments, the Fund may, with its Advisor, also enter into unfunded corporate
loans ("commitments"). Commitments may obligate the Fund to furnish temporary
financing to a borrower until permanent financing can be arranged. At February
29, 2008, the Fund had outstanding commitments of approximately $2,835,000. In
connection with these commitments, the Fund earns a commitment fee, typically
set as a percentage of the commitment amount. Such fee income, which is
classified in the Statement of Operations as facility and other fees, is
recognized ratably over the commitment period. As of February 29, 2008, the Fund
had the following unfunded loan commitments:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        Value of
                                                        Unfunded      Underlying
                                                      Commitment           Loans

Univision Communications, Inc. .......................      $168            $140
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

The Fund is a party to a revolving credit and security agreement funded by a
commercial paper asset securitization program with Citicorp North America, Inc.
("Citicorp"), as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and certain asset
securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). On May 16, 2007, the
agreement was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $370,000,000.
Under the Citicorp administered program, the conduits will fund advances to the
Fund through highly rated commercial paper. The Fund has granted a security
interest in substantially all of its assets to, and in favor of, the Lenders as
security for its obligations to the Lender. The interest rate on the Fund's
borrowings is based on the interest rate carried by the commercial paper plus a
program fee. In addition the Fund pays a liquidity fee to the secondary backstop
lenders and the agent. The weighted average annual interest rate was 5.54% for
the year ended February 29, 2008.

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

7. Distribution to Shareholders:

No provision is made for U.S. federal income taxes as it is the Fund's intention
to continue to qualify for and elect the tax treatment applicable to regulated
investment companies under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and to make the requisite distributions to their respective
shareholders, which will be sufficient to relieve them from federal income and
excise taxes.

Reclassifications: U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that
certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent differences
between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly, during the current year,
$51,081,498 has been reclassified between paid-in capital in excess of par and
accumulated net realized capital losses, and $890,224 has been reclassified
between accumulated net realized capital losses and undistributed net investment
income as a result of permanent differences attributable to expiration of
capital loss carryforwards, amortization methods on fixed income securities,
foreign currency transactions, and swap agreements. These reclassifications have
no effect on net assets or net asset values per share.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended February
29, 2008 and February 28, 2007 was as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    2/29/2008          2/28/2007
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income ........................        $71,016,850        $69,729,202
                                                  ------------------------------
Total taxable distributions ..............        $71,016,850        $69,729,202
                                                  ==============================

As of February 29, 2008, the components of accumulated losses on a tax basis
were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undistributed net ordinary income ..........................    $   6,446,869
Undistributed net long-term capital gains ..................               --
                                                                -------------
Total undistributed net earnings ...........................        6,446,869
Capital loss carryforward ..................................     (259,454,191)*
Net unrealized losses ......................................     (144,633,076)**
                                                                -------------
Total net accumulated losses ...............................    $(397,640,398)
                                                                =============

*     On February 29, 2008, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $259,454,191, of which $21,442,332 expires in 2009, $90,564,493 expires in
      2010, $85,285,305 expires in 2011, $17,223,475 expires in 2012,
      $21,126,025 expires in 2013, $20,233,987 expires in 2014 and $3,578,574
      expires in 2015. This amount will be available to offset like amounts of
      any future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized losses is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      difference between book and tax amortization methods for premiums and
      discounts on fixed income securities, book/tax differences in the accrual
      of income on securities in default, the deferral of post-October capital
      losses for tax purposes, the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
      gains (losses) on certain foreign currency contracts, the accounting for
      swap agreements and book/tax differences on investments in passive foreign
      investment companies.

8. Subsequent Event:

The Fund paid an ordinary income dividend in the amount of $0.053000 per share
on March 31, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2008.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") including the schedule of
investments, as of February 29, 2008, and the related statements of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of February 29, 2008, by correspondence with the
custodian and financial intermediaries; where replies were not received from
financial intermediaries, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. as of February 29, 2008, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

How the Plan Works -- The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by the Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the shareholders by The Bank of New York
Mellon (the "Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Fund declares a
dividend, participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of
Common Stock of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the
participant's account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of
outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset
value per share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus
estimated brokerage commissions (a condition often referred to as a "market
premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
shares. If the Fund's net asset value per share is greater than the market price
per share (a condition often referred to as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent
will invest the dividend amount by purchasing on the open market additional
shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount in open
market purchases, or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during
the purchase period, the Plan Agent will invest any uninvested portion in newly
issued shares. The shares acquired are credited to each shareholder's account.
The amount credited is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend
by either (i) when the shares are newly issued, the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued or (ii) when shares are purchased in the open
market, the average purchase price per share.

Participation in the Plan -- Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Fund unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time
without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan -- The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants
in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they could otherwise
purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received. However, there may not be enough shares
available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem shares, the price on resale
may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees -- There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders will
pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications -- The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore, income and
capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not receive
cash. Participation in the Plan generally will not affect the tax-exempt status
of exempt interest dividends paid by the Fund. If, when the Fund's shares are
trading at a market premium, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that
have a greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is
possible that all or a portion of the discount from the market value (which may
not exceed 5% of the fair market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as
a taxable distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it
is also possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable
to all the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the
Plan. Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information -- All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The Bank of
New York Mellon, One Wall Street, New York, NY 10286, Telephone: (800) 432-8224.

                           **    Following the combination of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, L.P. ("MLIM") and BlackRock, Inc.
                                 ("BlackRock") in September 2006, the various legacy MLIM and legacy BlackRock Fund boards were
                                 realigned and consolidated into three new Fund boards in 2007. As a result, although the chart
                                 shows certain directors as joining the Fund's board in 2007, those directors first became a member
                                 of the board of directors of other legacy MLIM or legacy BlackRock Funds as follows: G. Nicholas

Shareholders Who Hold Accounts with Investment Advisors, Banks or Brokerages:

Please contact your financial advisor to enroll. Please note that not all

General Information

The Fund does not make available copies of its Statements of Additional
Information because the Fund's shares are not continuously offered, which means
that the Statement of Additional Information of the Fund has not been updated
after completion of the Fund's offering and the information contained in the
Fund's Statement of Additional Information may have become outdated.

During the period, there were no material changes in the Fund's investment
objective or policies or to the Fund's character or by-laws that were not
approved by the shareholders or in the principal risk factors associated with
investment in the Fund. There have been no changes in the persons who are
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio.

The Fund will mail only one copy of shareholder documents, including annual and
semi-annual reports and proxy statements, to shareholders with multiple accounts
at the same address. This practice is commonly called "householding" and it is
intended to reduce expenses and eliminate duplicate mailings of shareholder
documents. Mailings of your shareholder documents may be householded
indefinitely unless you instruct us otherwise. If you do not want the mailing of
these documents to be combined with those for other members of your household,
please contact the Fund at (800) 441-7762.

regarding the Fund may be found on BlackRock's website, which can be accessed at

            determined that (i) the registrant has the following audit committee
            financial experts serving on its audit committee and (ii) each audit
            committee financial expert is independent:

            Kent Dixon (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Frank J. Fabozzi (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            James T. Flynn (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Ronald W. Forbes (term ended effective November 1, 2007)
            W. Carl Kester (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Karen P. Robards (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Robert S. Salomon, Jr. (term began effective November 1, 2007)
            Richard R. West (term ended effective November 1, 2007)

            The registrant's board of directors has determined that W. Carl
            Kester and Karen P. Robards qualify as financial experts pursuant to
            Item 3(c)(4) of Form N-CSR.

            Prof. Kester has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
            accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
            over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions. Prof.
            Kester has been involved in providing valuation and other financial
            consulting services to corporate clients since 1978. Prof. Kester's
            financial consulting services present a breadth and level of
            complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the
            breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to
            be raised by the registrant's financial statements.

            Ms. Robards has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
            accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
            over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions. Ms.

            advisory firm, since 1987. Ms. Robards was formerly an investment
            banker for more than 10 years where she was responsible for

            Under applicable securities laws, a person determined to be an audit
            committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any
            purpose, including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11
            of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or
            identified as an audit committee financial expert. The designation
            or identification as an audit committee financial expert does not
            impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liabilities
            greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on
            such person as a member of the audit committee and board of
            directors in the absence of such designation or identification.

            reasonably related to the performance of the audit of financial
            statements not included in Audit Fees.
      2     The nature of the services include tax compliance, tax advice and
            tax planning.
      3     The nature of the services include a review of compliance procedures
            and attestation thereto.

            (e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures:

                  The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
            policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
            Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
            registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
            Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
            provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to
            the registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly
            to the operations and the financial reporting of the registrant.
            Certain of these non-audit services that the Committee believes are
            a) consistent with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b)
            routine and recurring services that will not impair the independence
            of the independent accountants may be approved by the Committee
            without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis ("general
            pre-approval"). The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months
            from the date of the pre-approval, unless the Committee provides for
            a different period. Tax or other non-audit services provided to the
            registrant which have a direct impact on the operation or financial
            reporting of the registrant will only be deemed pre-approved
            provided that any individual project does not exceed $10,000
            attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for all of the registrants
            the Committee oversees. For this purpose, multiple projects will be
            aggregated to determine if they exceed the previously mentioned cost
            levels.

                  Any proposed services exceeding the pre-approved cost levels
            will require specific pre-approval by the Committee, as will any
            other services not subject to general pre-approval (e.g.,
            unanticipated but permissible services). The Committee is informed
            of each service approved subject to general pre-approval at the next
            regularly scheduled in-person board meeting. At this meeting, an
            analysis of such services is presented to the Committee for
            ratification. The Committee may delegate to one or more of its
            members the authority to approve the provision of and fees for any
            specific engagement of permitted non-audit services, including
            services exceeding pre-approved cost levels.

            (e)(2) None of the services described in each of Items 4(b) through
            (d) were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraph
            (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

            sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is

            adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
            control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services
            to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph

Item 8 -    Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies -
            as of February 29, 2008.

            (a)(1) BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. is managed by a team of
            investment professionals comprised of Mark J. Williams, Managing
            Director at BlackRock and Kevin J. Booth, CFA, Managing Director at
            BlackRock. Each is a member of BlackRock's fixed income portfolio

            Mr. Williams is the head of BlackRock's bank loan group and a member

            (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest

            BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, herein
            "BlackRock") has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
            compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
            protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
            another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address
            the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio

<PAGE>

            transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
            conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
            accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
            furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
            clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
            applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
            accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have
            performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio
            managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees),
            which may be the same as or different from those made to the Fund.
            In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and any officer, director,
            stockholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the
            securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Fund.
            BlackRock, or any of its affiliates, or any officer, director,
            stockholder, employee or any member of their families may take
            different actions than those recommended to the Fund by BlackRock
            with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain
            from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of
            companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
            directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
            which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors
            and employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest
            or possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager
            also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be
            opposed to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection,
            it should be noted that certain portfolio managers, including
            Messrs. Booth and Williams, currently manage certain accounts that
            are subject to performance fees. In addition, certain portfolio
            managers may assist in managing certain hedge funds and may be
            entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees earned on such
            funds and a portion of such incentive fees may be voluntarily or
            involuntarily deferred. Additional portfolio managers may in the
            future manage other such accounts or funds and may be entitled to
            receive incentive fees.

            As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
            must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
            securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated
            in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts
            to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
            accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
            end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
            investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
            client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve
            reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock
            with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that
            is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client
            base.

            (a)(3) As of February 29, 2008:

            Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview

            BlackRock's financial arrangements with its portfolio managers, its
            competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels
            reflect the value senior management places on key resources.
            Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from
            year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components
            of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based
            discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and
            one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by
            BlackRock such as its Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan and
            Restricted Stock Program.

<PAGE>

            Base compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base
            compensation based on their seniority and/or their position with the
            firm. Senior portfolio managers who perform additional management
            functions within the portfolio management group or within BlackRock
            may receive additional compensation for serving in these other
            capacities.

            Discretionary Incentive Compensation

            Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several
            components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of
            the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, the investment
            performance, including risk-adjusted returns, of the firm's assets
            under management or supervision by that portfolio manager relative
            to predetermined benchmarks, and the individual's seniority, role
            within the portfolio management team, teamwork and contribution to
            the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock. In most
            cases, including for the portfolio managers of the Fund, these
            benchmarks are the same as the benchmark or benchmarks against which
            the performance of the Fund or other accounts managed by the
            portfolio managers are measured. BlackRock's Chief Investment
            Officers determine the benchmarks against which the performance of
            funds and other accounts managed by each portfolio manager is
            compared and the period of time over which performance is evaluated.
            With respect to the portfolio managers, such benchmarks include the
            following:

            BlackRock's Chief Investment Officers make a subjective
            determination with respect to the portfolio managers' compensation
            based on the performance of the funds and other accounts managed by
            each portfolio manager relative to the various benchmarks noted
            above. Performance is measured on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis
            over various time periods including 1, 3, 5 and 10-year periods, as
            applicable.

            Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation

            Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio
            managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted
            stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. The
            BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units, if properly vested, will be
            settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Typically, the cash bonus,
            when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of total
            compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying a portion of annual
            bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for
            a given year "at risk" based on the Company's ability to sustain and
            improve its performance over future periods.

            Other compensation benefits. In addition to base compensation and
            discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be
            eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:

<PAGE>

                  Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan ("LTIP") --The LTIP is
            a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward certain key
            employees. Prior to 2006, the plan provided for the grant of awards
            that were expressed as an amount of cash that, if properly vested
            and subject to the attainment of certain performance goals, will be
            settled in cash and/or in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Beginning in
            2006, awards are granted under the LTIP in the form of BlackRock,
            Inc. restricted stock units that, if properly vested and subject to
            the attainment of certain performance goals, will be settled in
            BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Each portfolio manager has received
            awards under the LTIP.

                  Deferred Compensation Program --A portion of the compensation
            paid to eligible BlackRock employees may be voluntarily deferred
            into an account that tracks the performance of certain of the firm's
            investment products. Each participant in the deferred compensation
            program is permitted to allocate his deferred amounts among various
            options, including to certain of the firm's hedge funds and other
            proprietary mutual funds. Each portfolio manager has participated in
            the deferred compensation program.

                  Options and Restricted Stock Awards -- A portion of the annual
            compensation of certain employees is mandatorily deferred into
            BlackRock restricted stock units. Prior to the mandatory deferral
            into restricted stock units, the Company granted stock options to
            key employees, including certain portfolio managers who may still
            hold unexercised or unvested options. BlackRock, Inc. also granted
            restricted stock awards designed to reward certain key employees as
            an incentive to contribute to the long-term success of BlackRock.
            These awards vest over a period of years. Mr. Williams has been
            granted stock options and/or restricted stock in prior years.

                  Incentive Savings Plans -- BlackRock, Inc. has created a
            variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock employees are
            eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock
            Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), and the BlackRock Employee Stock
            Purchase Plan (ESPP). The employer contribution components of the
            RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 6% of eligible
            pay contributed to the plan capped at $4,000 per year, and a company
            retirement contribution equal to 3% of eligible compensation, plus
            an additional contribution of 2% for any year in which BlackRock has
            positive net operating income. The RSP offers a range of investment
            options, including registered investment companies managed by the
            firm. Company contributions follow the investment direction set by
            participants for their own contributions or, absent employee
            investment direction, are invested into a balanced portfolio. The
            ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock common stock at a 5%
            discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date.
            Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to the purchase of 1,000
            shares or a dollar value of $25,000. Each portfolio manager is
            eligible to participate in these plans.

            (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of February 29, 2008,
                   the portfolio managers beneficially owned stock issued by the
                   Fund in the ranges set forth below:

                      Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

      These Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures ("Policy") for BlackRock
Advisors, LLC and its affiliated U.S. registered investment advisers(1)
("BlackRock"), which were effective October 1, 2006 and Amended and Restated
March 5, 2008, reflect our duty as a fiduciary under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") to vote proxies in the best interests of our
clients. BlackRock serves as the investment manager for investment companies,
other commingled investment vehicles and/or separate accounts of institutional
and other clients. The right to vote proxies for securities held in such
accounts belongs to BlackRock's clients. Certain clients of BlackRock have
retained the right to vote such proxies in general or in specific
circumstances.(2) Other clients, however, have delegated to BlackRock the right
to vote proxies for securities held in their accounts as part of BlackRock's
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets.

      When BlackRock votes proxies for a client that has delegated to BlackRock
proxy voting authority, BlackRock acts as the client's agent. Under the Advisers
Act, an investment adviser is a fiduciary that owes each of its clients a duty
of care and loyalty with respect to all services the adviser undertakes on the
client's behalf, including proxy voting. BlackRock is therefore subject to a
fiduciary duty to vote proxies in a manner BlackRock believes is consistent with
the client's best interests,(3) whether or not the client's proxy voting is
subject to the fiduciary standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 ("ERISA").(4) When voting proxies for client accounts (including
investment companies), BlackRock's primary objective is to make voting decisions
solely in the best interests of clients and ERISA clients' plan beneficiaries
and participants. In fulfilling its obligations to clients, BlackRock will seek
to act in a manner that it believes is most likely to enhance the economic value
of the underlying securities held in client accounts.(5) It is imperative that
BlackRock considers the interests of its clients, and not the interests of
BlackRock, when voting proxies and that real (or perceived) material conflicts
that may arise between BlackRock's interest and those of BlackRock's clients are
properly addressed and resolved.

- ----------
(1) The Policy does not apply to BlackRock Asset Management U.K. Limited and
BlackRock Investment Managers International Limited, which are U.S. registered
investment advisers based in the United Kingdom.
(2) In certain situations, a client may direct BlackRock to vote in accordance
with the client's proxy voting policies. In these situations, BlackRock will
seek to comply with such policies to the extent it would not be inconsistent
with other BlackRock legal responsibilities.
(3) Letter from Harvey L. Pitt, Chairman, SEC, to John P.M. Higgins, President,
Ram Trust Services (February 12, 2002) (Section 206 of the Investment Advisers
Act imposes a fiduciary responsibility to vote proxies fairly and in the best
interests of clients); SEC Release No. IA-2106 (February 3, 2003).
(4) DOL Interpretative Bulletin of Sections 402, 403 and 404 of ERISA at 29
C.F.R. 2509.94-2
(5) Other considerations, such as social, labor, environmental or other
policies, may be of interest to particular clients. While BlackRock is cognizant
of the importance of such considerations, when voting proxies it will generally
take such matters into account only to the extent that they have a direct
bearing on the economic value of the underlying securities. To the extent that a
BlackRock client desires to pursue a particular social, labor, environmental or
other agenda through the proxy votes made for its securities held through
BlackRock as investment adviser, BlackRock encourages the client to consider
retaining direct proxy voting authority or to appoint independently a special
proxy voting fiduciary other than BlackRock.

<PAGE>

      Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-6 was adopted by the SEC in 2003 and requires,
among other things, that an investment adviser that exercises voting authority
over clients' proxy voting adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients,
discloses to its clients information about those policies and procedures and
also discloses to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has
voted their proxies.

      In light of such fiduciary duties, the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6, and
given the complexity of the issues that may be raised in connection with proxy
votes, BlackRock has adopted these policies and procedures. BlackRock's Equity
Investment Policy Oversight Committee, or a sub-committee thereof (the
"Committee"), addresses proxy voting issues on behalf of BlackRock and its
clients.(6) The Committee is comprised of senior members of BlackRock's
Portfolio Management Group and advised by BlackRock's Legal and Compliance
Department.

- ----------
(6) Subject to the Proxy Voting Policies of Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Company
FSB, the Committee may also function jointly as the Proxy Voting Committee for
Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Company FSB trust accounts managed by personnel
dually-employed by BlackRock.

<PAGE>

I.    Scope of Committee Responsibilities

      The Committee shall have the responsibility for determining how to address
proxy votes made on behalf of all BlackRock clients, except for clients who have
retained the right to vote their own proxies, either generally or on any
specific matter. In so doing, the Committee shall seek to ensure that proxy
votes are made in the best interests of clients, and that proxy votes are
determined in a manner free from unwarranted or inappropriate influences. The
Committee shall also oversee the overall administration of proxy voting for
BlackRock accounts.(7)

      The Committee shall establish BlackRock's proxy voting guidelines, with
such advice, participation and research as the Committee deems appropriate from
portfolio managers, proxy voting services or other knowledgeable interested
parties. As it is anticipated that there will not necessarily be a "right" way
to vote proxies on any given issue applicable to all facts and circumstances,
the Committee shall also be responsible for determining how the proxy voting
guidelines will be applied to specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's
unique structure, management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances,
probable economic and other anticipated consequences of alternative actions. In
so doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a manner
contrary to its generally stated guidelines.

      The Committee may determine that the subject matter of certain proxy
issues are not suitable for general voting guidelines and requires a
case-by-case determination, in which case the Committee may elect not to adopt a
specific voting guideline applicable to such issues. BlackRock believes that
certain proxy voting issues - such as approval of mergers and other significant
corporate transactions - require investment analysis akin to investment
decisions, and are therefore not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee
may elect to adopt a common BlackRock position on certain proxy votes that are
akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit portfolio managers to make
individual decisions on how best to maximize economic value for the accounts for
which they are responsible (similar to normal buy/sell investment decisions made
by such portfolio managers).(8)

      While it is expected that BlackRock, as a fiduciary, will generally seek
to vote proxies over which BlackRock exercises voting authority in a uniform
manner for all BlackRock clients, the Committee, in conjunction with the
portfolio manager of an account, may determine that the specific circumstances
of such account require that such account's proxies be voted differently due to
such account's investment objective or other factors that differentiate it from
other accounts. In addition, on proxy votes that are akin to investment

- ----------
(7) The Committee may delegate day-to-day administrative responsibilities to
other BlackRock personnel and/or outside service providers, as appropriate.
(8) The Committee will normally defer to portfolio managers on proxy votes that
are akin to investment decisions except for proxy votes that involve a material
conflict of interest, in which case it will determine, in its discretion, the
appropriate voting process so as to address such conflict.

<PAGE>

decisions, BlackRock believes portfolio managers may from time to time
legitimately reach differing but equally valid views, as fiduciaries for
BlackRock's clients, on how best to maximize economic value in respect of a
particular investment.

      The Committee will also be responsible for ensuring the maintenance of
records of each proxy vote, as required by Advisers Act Rule 204-2.(9) All
records will be maintained in accordance with applicable law. Except as may be
required by applicable legal requirements, or as otherwise set forth herein, the
Committee's determinations and records shall be treated as proprietary,
nonpublic and confidential.

      The Committee shall be assisted by other BlackRock personnel, as may be
appropriate. In particular, the Committee has delegated to the BlackRock
Operations Department responsibility for monitoring corporate actions and
ensuring that proxy votes are submitted in a timely fashion. The Operations
Department shall ensure that proxy voting issues are promptly brought to the
Committee's attention and that the Committee's proxy voting decisions are
appropriately disseminated and implemented.

      To assist BlackRock in voting proxies, the Committee may retain the
services of a firm providing such services. BlackRock has currently retained
Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") in that role. ISS is an independent
adviser that specializes in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related
services to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians,
consultants, and other institutional investors. The services provided to
BlackRock may include, but are not limited to, in-depth research, voting
recommendations (which the Committee is not obligated to follow), vote
execution, and recordkeeping.

- ----------
(9) The Committee may delegate the actual maintenance of such records to an
outside service provider. Currently, the Committee has delegated the maintenance
of such records to Institutional Shareholder Services.

<PAGE>

II.   Special Circumstances

      Routine Consents. BlackRock may be asked from time to time to consent to
an amendment to, or grant a waiver under, a loan agreement, partnership
agreement, indenture or other governing document of a specific financial
instrument held by BlackRock clients. BlackRock will generally treat such
requests for consents not as "proxies" subject to these Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures but as investment matters to be dealt with by the responsible
BlackRock investment professionals would, provided that such consents (i) do not
relate to the election of a board of directors or appointment of auditors of a
public company, and (ii) either (A) would not otherwise materially affect the
structure, management or control of a public company, or (B) relate to a company
in which BlackRock clients hold only interests in bank loans or debt securities
and are consistent with customary standards and practices for such instruments.

      Securities on Loan. Registered investment companies that are advised by
BlackRock as well as certain of our advisory clients may participate in
securities lending programs. Under most securities lending arrangements,
securities on loan may not be voted by the lender (unless the loan is recalled).
BlackRock believes that each client has the right to determine whether
participating in a securities lending program enhances returns, to contract with
the securities lending agent of its choice and to structure a securities lending
program, through its lending agent, that balances any tension between loaning
and voting securities in a matter that satisfies such client. If client has
decided to participate in a securities lending program, BlackRock will therefore
defer to the client's determination and not attempt to seek recalls solely for
the purpose of voting routine proxies as this could impact the returns received
from securities lending and make the client a less desirable lender in a
marketplace. Where a client retains a lending agent that is unaffiliated with
BlackRock, BlackRock will generally not seek to vote proxies relating to
securities on loan because BlackRock does not have a contractual right to recall
such loaned securities for the purpose of voting proxies. Where BlackRock or an
affiliate acts as the lending agent, BlackRock will also generally not seek to
recall loaned securities for proxy voting purposes, unless the portfolio manager
responsible for the account or the Committee determines that voting the proxy is
in the client's best interest and requests that the security be recalled.

      Voting Proxies for Non-US Companies. While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States, voting proxies of non-US companies
frequently involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock's ability to
vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These
issues include (but are not limited to): (i) untimely notice of shareholder
meetings, (ii) restrictions on a foreigner's ability to exercise votes, (iii)
requirements to vote proxies in person, (iv) "shareblocking" (requirements that
investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of
their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder
meeting), (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy, and (vi)
requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to
facilitate voting instructions.

<PAGE>

      As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies of non-US companies only on a
"best-efforts" basis. In addition, the Committee may determine that it is
generally in the best interests of BlackRock clients not to vote proxies of
companies in certain countries if the Committee determines that the costs
(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with shareblocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote generally are expected to
outweigh the benefit the client will derive by voting on the issuer's proposal.
If the Committee so determines in the case of a particular country, the
Committee (upon advice from BlackRock portfolio managers) may override such
determination with respect to a particular issuer's shareholder meeting if the
Committee believes the benefits of seeking to exercise a vote at such meeting
outweighs the costs, in which case BlackRock will seek to vote on a best-efforts
basis.

      Securities Sold After Record Date. With respect to votes in connection
with securities held on a particular record date but sold from a client account
prior to the holding of the related meeting, BlackRock may take no action on
proposals to be voted on in such meeting.

      Conflicts of Interest. From time to time, BlackRock may be required to
vote proxies in respect of an issuer that is an affiliate of BlackRock (a
"BlackRock Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of BlackRock (a
"BlackRock Client").(10) In such event, provided that the Committee is aware of
the real or potential conflict, the following procedures shall apply:

      o     The Committee intends to adhere to the voting guidelines set forth
            herein for all proxy issues including matters involving BlackRock
            Affiliates and BlackRock Clients. If, however, the matter to be
            voted on represents a non-routine matter that is material to a
            BlackRock Affiliate or a BlackRock Client and the Committee does not
            reasonably believe it is able to follow its general voting
            guidelines (or if the particular proxy matter is not addressed in
            the guidelines) and vote impartially, the Committee may, in its
            discretion for the purposes of ensuring that an independent
            determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to advise
            the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of
            BlackRock's clients; and
      o     if the Committee determines not to retain an independent fiduciary,
            or does not desire to follow the advice of such independent
            fiduciary, the Committee shall determine how to vote the proxy after
            consulting with the BlackRock Legal and Compliance Department and
            concluding that the vote cast is in the client's best interest
            notwithstanding the conflict.

- ----------
(10) Such issuers may include investment companies for which BlackRock provides
investment advisory, administrative and/or other services.

<PAGE>

III.  Voting Guidelines

      The Committee has determined that it is appropriate and in the best
interests of BlackRock's clients to adopt the following voting guidelines, which
represent the Committee's usual voting position on certain recurring proxy
issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances. With respect to
any particular proxy issue, however, the Committee may elect to vote differently
than a voting guideline if the Committee determines that doing so is, in the
Committee's judgment, in the best interest of its clients. The guidelines may be
reviewed at any time upon the request of any Committee member and may be amended
or deleted upon the vote of a majority of voting Committee members present at a
Committee meeting for which there is a quorum.

<PAGE>

      A. Boards of Directors

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders relating to
the composition of the Board of Directors of companies other than investment
companies. As a general matter, the Committee believes that a company's Board of
Directors (rather than shareholders) is most likely to have access to important,
nonpublic information regarding a company's business and prospects, and is
therefore best-positioned to set corporate policy and oversee management. The
Committee therefore believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is
the election of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to
diligently represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over time.
In individual cases, the Committee may look at a Director nominee's history of
representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies, or other
factors to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#     VOTE and DESCRIPTION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.1   FOR nominees for director of United States companies in uncontested
      elections, except for nominees who
      o     have missed at least two meetings and, as a result, attended less
            than 75% of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees
            the previous year, unless the nominee missed the meeting(s) due to
            illness or company business
      o     voted to implement or renew a "dead-hand" poison pill
      o     ignored a shareholder proposal that was approved by either a
            majority of the shares outstanding in any year or by the majority of
            votes cast for two consecutive years
      o     failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the
            shareholders have tendered their shares
      o     are corporate insiders who serve on the audit, compensation or
            nominating committees or on a full Board that does not have such
            committees composed exclusively of independent directors
      o     on a case-by-case basis, have served as directors of other companies
            with allegedly poor corporate governance
      o     sit on more than six boards of public companies
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.2   FOR nominees for directors of non-U.S. companies in uncontested elections,
      except for nominees from whom the Committee determines to withhold votes
      due to the nominees' poor records of representing shareholder interests,
      on a case-by-case basis
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.3   FOR proposals to declassify Boards of Directors, except where there exists
      a legitimate purpose for classifying boards
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.4   AGAINST proposals to classify Boards of Directors, except where there
      exists a legitimate purpose for classifying boards
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.8   FOR proposals seeking election of supervisory board members

A.9   AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking additional representation of women
      and/or minorities generally (i.e., not specific individuals) to a Board of
      Directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.10  AGAINST shareholder proposals for term limits for directors

A.22  AGAINST proposals to eliminate shareholder ability to remove directors
      directly
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.23  FOR shareholder proposals requiring the position of chair be filled by an
      independent director unless there are compelling reasons to recommend

A.24  FOR precatory and binding resolutions requesting that the board change the
      company's by-laws to stipulate that directors need to be elected with an
      affirmative majority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the
      state law where the company is incorporated. Binding resolutions need to
      allow for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard when there are more
      nominees than board seats
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.25  AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring two candidates per board seat
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.26  AGAINST proposals to eliminate entirely directors' and officers' liability
      for monetary damages for violating the duty of care
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.27  AGAINST indemnification proposals that would expand coverage beyond just
      legal expenses to liability for acts, such as negligence, that are more
      serious violations of fiduciary obligation than mere carelessness
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.28  AGAINST proposals that would expand the scope of indemnification to
      provide for mandatory indemnification of company officials in connection
      with acts that previously the company was permitted to provide
      indemnification for at the discretion of the company's board (i.e.
      "permissive indemnification"), but that previously the company was not
      required to indemnify
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.29  FOR only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a
      director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if both of the
      following apply:
      o     If the director was found to have acted in good faith and in a
            manner that he or she reasonably believed was in the best interests
            of the company; and
      o     If only the director's legal expenses would be covered
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.30  AGAINST proposals that provide that directors may be removed only for
      cause
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.31  FOR proposals to restore shareholders' ability to remove directors with or
      without cause
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.32  AGAINST proposals that provide that only continuing directors may elect
      replacements to fill board vacancies
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.33  FOR proposals that permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board
      vacancies, provided that it is understood that investment company
      directors may fill Board vacancies as permitted by the Investment Company
      Act of 1940, as amended
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      B. Auditors

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders related to
the selection of auditors. As a general matter, the Committee believes that
corporate auditors have a responsibility to represent the interests of
shareholders and provide an independent view on the propriety of financial
reporting decisions of corporate management. While the Committee will generally
defer to a corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee
may look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.1   FOR approval of independent auditors, except for
      o     auditors that have a financial interest in, or material association
            with, the company they are auditing, and are therefore believed by
            the Committee not to be independent
      o     auditors who have rendered an opinion to any company which in the
            Committee's opinion is either not consistent with best accounting
            practices or not indicative of the company's financial situation
      o     on a case-by-case basis, auditors who in the Committee's opinion
            provide a significant amount of non-audit services to the company
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.2   FOR proposals seeking authorization to fix the remuneration of auditors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.3   FOR approving internal statutory auditors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.4   FOR proposals for audit firm rotation, except for proposals that would
      require rotation after a period of less than 5 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

      C. Compensation and Benefits

      These proposals concern those issues submitted to shareholders related to
management compensation and employee benefits. As a general matter, the
Committee favors disclosure of a company's compensation and benefit policies and
opposes excessive compensation, but believes that compensation matters are
normally best determined by a corporation's board of directors, rather than
shareholders. Proposals to "micro-manage" a company's compensation practices or
to set arbitrary restrictions on compensation or benefits will therefore
generally not be supported.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.1   IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF ISS on compensation plans if the
      ISS recommendation is based solely on whether or not the company's plan
      satisfies the allowable cap as calculated by ISS. If the recommendation of
      ISS is based on factors other than whether the plan satisfies the
      allowable cap the Committee will analyze the particular proposed plan.
      This policy applies to amendments of plans as well as to initial
      approvals.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.2   FOR proposals to eliminate retirement benefits for outside directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.3   AGAINST proposals to establish retirement benefits for outside directors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.4   FOR proposals approving the remuneration of directors or of supervisory
      board members
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.5   AGAINST proposals to reprice stock options
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.6   FOR proposals to approve employee stock purchase plans that apply to all
      employees. This policy applies to proposals to amend ESPPs if the plan as
      amended applies to all employees.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.7   FOR proposals to pay retirement bonuses to directors of Japanese companies
      unless the directors have served less than three years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.8   AGAINST proposals seeking to pay outside directors only in stock
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.9   FOR proposals seeking further disclosure of executive pay or requiring
      companies to report on their supplemental executive retirement benefits
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.10  AGAINST proposals to ban all future stock or stock option grants to
      executives
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.11  AGAINST option plans or grants that apply to directors or employees of
      "related companies" without adequate disclosure of the corporate
      relationship and justification of the option policy
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.12  FOR proposals to exclude pension plan income in the calculation of
      earnings used in determining executive bonuses/compensation
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.13  FOR shareholder proposals - based on a case-by-case analysis - that
      request the Board to establish a pay-for-superior performance standard in
      the company's executive compensation plan for senior executives
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.14  AGAINST executive compensation plans in which there is a no connection
      between the CEO's pay and company performance (e.g., the plan calls for an
      increase in pay and when there has been a decrease in company performance
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.15  WITHHOLD votes from the Compensation Committee members when company
      compensation plan has no connection between executive pay and company
      performance
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.16  FOR shareholder proposals that call for non-binding shareholder
      ratification of the compensation of the named Executive Officers and the
      accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to
      understand the Summary Compensation Table
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.17  FOR shareholder proposals seeking disclosure regarding the company, Board,
      or Board committee's use of compensation consultants, such as company
      name, business relationship(s) and fees paid
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.18  AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking to set absolute levels on
      compensation or otherwise dictate the amount or form of compensation
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.19  FOR shareholder proposals to require golden parachutes or executive
      severance agreements to be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless
      the proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into
      employment contracts
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.20  FOR shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits
      contained in Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP") agreements
      to a shareholder vote unless the company's executive pension plans do not
      contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employee-wide
      plans
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.21  FOR shareholder proposals requesting to limit the executive benefits
      provided under the company's supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP)
      by limiting covered compensation to a senior executive's annual salary and
      excluding all incentive or bonus pay from the SERP's definition of covered
      compensation used to establish such benefits
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.22  AGAINST the equity plan if any of the following factors apply:
      o     The total cost of the company's equity plans is unreasonable;
      o     The plan expressly permits the repricing of stock options without
            prior shareholder approval;
      o     There is a disconnect between CEO pay and the company's performance;
            and/or
      o     The plan is a vehicle for poor compensation practices
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.23  FOR equity plans for non-employee director on a case-by-case basis based
      on the structure of the plan
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.24  AGAINST plans if the company has a history of repricing options without
      shareholder approval, and the applicable listing standards would not
      preclude them from doing so
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.25  FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      D. Capital Structure

      These proposals relate to various requests, principally from management,
for approval of amendments that would alter the capital structure of a company,
such as an increase in authorized shares. As a general matter, the Committee
will support requests that it believes enhance the rights of common shareholders
and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably dilutive.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.1   AGAINST proposals seeking authorization to issue shares without preemptive
      rights except for issuances up to 10% of a non-US company's total
      outstanding capital
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.2   FOR management proposals seeking preemptive rights or seeking
      authorization to issue shares with preemptive rights
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.3   FOR management proposals approving share repurchase programs
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.4   FOR management proposals to split a company's stock
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.5   FOR management proposals to denominate or authorize denomination of
      securities or other obligations or assets in Euros
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.6   FOR proposals requiring a company to expense stock options (unless the
      company has already publicly committed to do so by a certain date)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.7   AGAINST proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior
      voting rights
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.8   AGAINST proposals at companies with dual-class capital structures to
      increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock that has
      superior voting rights
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.9   FOR proposals to create a new class of nonvoting or sub-voting common
      stock if:
      o     It is intended for financing purposes with minimal or no dilution to
            current shareholders; and
      o     It is not designed to preserve the voting power of an insider or
            significant shareholder
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.10  AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
      stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and
      other rights ("blank check" preferred stock)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.11  FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
      specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock
      and the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.12  FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split when the
      number of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.13  FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split to avoid
      delisting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.14  FOR management proposals to increase the common share authorization for a
      stock split or share dividend
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.15  FOR management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans
      in which all shareholders may participate on equal terms
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      E. Corporate Charter and By-Laws

      These proposals relate to various requests for approval of amendments to a
corporation's charter or by-laws, principally for the purpose of adopting or
redeeming "poison pills". As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
provisions.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.1   AGAINST proposals seeking to adopt a poison pill
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.2   FOR proposals seeking to redeem a poison pill
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.3   FOR proposals seeking to have poison pills submitted to shareholders for
      ratification
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.4   FOR management proposals to change the company's name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.5   AGAINST proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.6   FOR proposals to lower supermajority vote requirements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.7   AGAINST proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.8   FOR proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition
      to shareholders
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.9   CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to change a company's state of incorporation,
      taking into consideration both financial and corporate governance
      concerns, including:
      -     The reasons for reincorporating
      -     A comparison of the governance provisions
      -     Comparative economic benefits, and
      -     A comparison of the jurisdiction laws
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.10  FOR re-incorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or
      negative governance changes
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.11  FOR proposals to restore, or provide shareholders with rights of appraisal
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

      F. Corporate Meetings

      These are routine proposals relating to various requests regarding the
formalities of corporate meetings.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.1   AGAINST proposals that seek authority to act on "any other business that
      may arise"
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.2   FOR proposals designating two shareholders to keep minutes of the meeting
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.3   FOR proposals concerning accepting or approving financial statements and
      statutory reports
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.4   FOR proposals approving the discharge of management and the supervisory
      board
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.5   FOR  proposals approving the allocation of income and the dividend
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.6   FOR proposals seeking authorization to file required documents/other
      formalities
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.7   FOR proposals to authorize the corporate board to ratify and execute
      approved resolutions
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.8   FOR proposals appointing inspectors of elections
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.11  AGAINST proposals to require rotating sites for shareholder meetings
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.12  AGAINST proposals that are substantially duplicative (i.e., shareholder
      proposals that are unnecessary because a management proposal serves the
      same purpose)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

      G. Investment Companies

      These proposals relate to proxy issues that are associated solely with
holdings of shares of investment companies, including, but not limited to,
investment companies for which BlackRock provides investment advisory,
administrative and/or other services. As with other types of companies, the
Committee believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its
shareholders) is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management.
However, the Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over
certain matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
Investment Company Act of 1940 envisions will be approved directly by
shareholders.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.1   FOR nominees for director of mutual funds in uncontested elections, except
      for nominees who
      o     have missed at least two meetings and, as a result, attended less
            than 75% of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees
            the previous year, unless the nominee missed the meeting due to
            illness or fund business
      o     ignore a shareholder proposal that was approved by either a majority
            of the shares outstanding in any year or by the majority of votes
            cast for two consecutive years
      o     are interested directors who serve on the audit or nominating
            committees or on a full Board that does not have such committees
            composed exclusively of independent directors
      o     on a case-by-case basis, have served as directors of companies with
            allegedly poor corporate governance
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.2   FOR the establishment of new series or classes of shares
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.3   AGAINST proposals to change a fund's investment objective to
      nonfundamental
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.4   FOR proposals to establish a master-feeder structure or authorizing the
      Board to approve a master-feeder structure without a further shareholder
      vote
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.5   AGAINST a shareholder proposal for the establishment of a director
      ownership requirement
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.6   FOR classified boards of closed-end investment companies
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.7   AGAINST removal of shareholder approval requirement to reorganize or
      terminate the trust or any of its series
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

      H. Environmental and Social Issues

      These are shareholder proposals to limit corporate conduct in some manner
that relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are inappropriate
forums for the discussion of larger social issues, and opposes shareholder
resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting release of
information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an investment in the
corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee is generally supportive
of proposals to require corporate disclosure of matters that seem relevant and
material to the economic interests of shareholders, the Committee is generally
not supportive of proposals to require disclosure of corporate matters for other
purposes.

      The Committee's general policy is to vote:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.1   AGAINST proposals seeking to have companies adopt international codes of
      conduct
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.2   AGAINST proposals seeking to have companies provide non-required reports
      on:
      o   environmental liabilities;
      o   bank lending policies;
      o   corporate political contributions or activities;
      o   alcohol advertising and efforts to discourage drinking by minors;
      o   costs and risk of doing business in any individual country;
      o   involvement in nuclear defense systems
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.3   AGAINST proposals requesting reports on Maquiladora operations or on CERES
      principles
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.4   AGAINST proposals seeking implementation of the CERES principles
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.5   FOR resolutions requesting that a company disclose information on the
      impact of climate change on the company's operations unless:
      -     The company already provides current, publicly available information
            on the perceived impact that climate change may have on the company
            as well as associated policies and procedures to address such risks
            and/or opportunities;
      -     The company's level of disclosure is comparable to or better than
            information provided by industry peers; and
      -     There are no significant fines, penalties, or litigation associated
            with the company's environmental performance
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.6   AGAINST proposals that call for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
      specified amounts or within a restrictive time frame unless the company
      lags industry standards and has been the subject of recent, significant
      fines or litigation resulting from greenhouse gas emissions
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.7   FOR resolutions requesting that companies outline their preparations to
      comply with standards established by Kyoto Protocol signatory markets
      unless:
      -     The company does not maintain operations in Kyoto signatory markets;
      -     The company already evaluates and substantially discloses such
            information;
      -     Greenhouse gas emissions do not significantly impact the company's
            core businesses; or
      -     The company is not required to comply with the Kyoto Protocol
            standards
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.8   AGAINST resolutions that request the disclosure of detailed information on
      a company's policies related to land use or development unless the company
      has been the subject of recent, significant fines or litigation stemming
      from its land use
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.9   AGAINST proposals to publish in newspapers and public media the company's
      political contributions as such publications could present significant
      cost to the company without providing commensurate value to shareholders
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.10  AGAINST proposals barring the company from making political contributions.
      Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and local
      level and barring contributions can put the company at a competitive
      disadvantage
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.11  AGAINST proposals restricting the company from making charitable
      contributions. Charitable contributions are generally useful for assisting
      worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill in the community. In the
      absence of bad faith, self-dealing, or gross negligence, management should
      determine which contributions are in the best interests of the company
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.12  AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives, directors,
      consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that have
      prior government service and whether such service had a bearing on the
      business of the company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare
      without providing any meaningful information to shareholders
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
