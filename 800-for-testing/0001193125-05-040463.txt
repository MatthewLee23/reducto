ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

        The Annual Report to Stockholders follows.

<PAGE>

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

    Performance Review: We are pleased to report that your Fund had a total
return (market price change plus income) of 17.4% for the year ended December
31, 2004. In comparison, the S&P Utilities Index had a total return of 24.3%. A
composite of the S&P Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index,
reflecting the stock and bond ratio of the Fund, had a total return of 19.4%.

    On a longer-term basis, as of December 31, 2004, your Fund had a three-year
cumulative total return of 36.3%. In comparison, the S&P Utilities Index had a
total return during that period of 10.0%, while a composite of the S&P
Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index, reflecting the stock and
bond ratio of the Fund, had a total return of 12.1%. For the three-year period,
your Fund also outperformed the S&P 500 Index return of 11.3% and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average return of 14.9%.

    Consistent with its primary objective of current income, the Fund declared
twelve monthly 6.5 cent per share dividends during 2004. The Fund also declared
an extra one and one-half cents per share in the final dividend of the year
(paid in January 2005). This "extra" amount was declared because the Fund's
2004 operating earnings and investment gains exceeded 78 cents per share. This
was the thirteenth "extra" dividend in the last seventeen years.

    The 6.5 cent per share monthly rate, without compounding, would be 78 cents
annualized, or a 6.54% common stock dividend yield based on the December 31,
2004 closing price of $11.92 per share. That yield compares favorably with the
quarter-end yields of 3.19% on the Dow Jones Utility Index and 3.44% on the S&P
Utilities Index.

    Is Fed Policy Still Relevant for Investors? Common sense and economic
theory suggest to investors that the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) monetary policy
does matter. After all, the Fed's policy decisions affect the availability and
cost of money and credit, which in turn affect a wide range of economic
variables including employment, output, and the prices of goods and services.
The capital markets, both stock and bond, have their valuations set in part by
the cost and availability of credit, and the outlook for the demand for goods
and services. Moreover, investor intuition says that certain stock market
sectors and companies are more sensitive than others to changes in monetary
policy.

    A study by Conover, Jensen, Johnson, and Mercer published in the
January/February issue of the Financial Analysts Journal quantifies the impact
of monetary policy on the aggregate stock markets, their economic sectors, and
individual companies. The study covered long-term stock returns from 1963 to
2001. Sensitivity to monetary policy was measured relative to several criteria
including company size and industry. The study had several conclusions that
would not surprise investors and several that could be characterized as
surprising.

    Not surprising is the conclusion that monetary conditions have a strong
relationship with security returns. In periods of monetary accommodation (when
the Fed is lowering interest rates), investors tend to enjoy above average
stock returns. Likewise, in periods of monetary restraint (when the Fed is

<PAGE>

raising interest rates), investors tend to experience below average stock
returns. This relationship of Fed policy and equity returns is very consistent.
Also not surprising, is the higher sensitivity of small company stocks to
monetary conditions. Small companies typically are more financially sensitive
to the cost of capital and consumer demand.

    The study findings also indicate that the returns on cyclical industry
stocks, those with the most sensitivity to general business conditions, are the
most closely tied to monetary policy. Defensive sectors performed best during
periods of restrictive monetary policy. Perhaps partly surprising to investor
intuition is that utilities ranked second of the best performing sectors during
periods of restrictive monetary policy. We will see if the conclusions of this
study in regard to utilities hold true in the current cycle.

    It seems clear that current monetary policy is becoming more restrictive.
In January 2004, the Federal Reserve changed its commitment to hold rates
steady for "a considerable period" in favor of saying that it would be
"patient." In June 2004, the Fed raised the federal funds rate for the first
time in more than four years, the first of five rate hikes in 2004, and began
speaking about "measured" increases in short-term rates. The recently released
minutes of the December 14, 2004 Fed policy meeting cites robust consumer
spending, gradually improving employment conditions, increasing single-family
home and condo prices, and the role of prolonged monetary accommodation in
potential excessive risk-taking in financial markets as reasons it would
continue to move in the direction of monetary restraint.

    Less clear is how the economy and capital markets will respond to the Fed's
current steps toward a more restrictive monetary policy. Favorable business
fundamentals are expected to remain intact through 2005, though the rate of
increase in aggregate corporate revenue and profits is widely forecasted to
decline somewhat. Interest rates remain historically low and corporations have
access to low cost capital and many have generated sizable cash pools from
internal operations.

    Your Fund managers spend more time focused on utility and REIT fundamentals
and valuations than divining macro-economic conditions, and we believe that
there are many and varied reasons for investing in utilities and REITs. When we
speak to shareholders and potential shareholders, we often refer to the
diversification benefits of utilities--that utility stock prices can move
differently from the stocks of other economic sectors and, therefore, may
enhance long-term portfolio returns and reduce portfolio volatility. We also
refer to the importance of higher yield in long-term total return. More
recently, however, we have also discussed improving utility company
fundamentals--the continuing emphasis on stable and predictable earnings,
strong cash flow, financial strength, and efficient operation of core
businesses.

    At the February Board meeting each year, the Fund's analysts present
utility and REIT industry trends and outlooks. A more through review of
specific issues based on those presentations will appear in our next quarterly
letter to you.

    Board of Directors Meeting: At the regular December 2004 Board of
Directors' meeting, the Board declared the following monthly dividends:

    The determination of the character of all Fund distributions (specifying
which portion is ordinary income, qualifying dividend income, short or long
term capital gains, or return of capital) is made each year-end and is reported
to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed every year in late January.

    At the February 2005 meeting, the Board reviewed the Fund's dividend policy
and reaffirmed the current 6.5 cents per share per month distribution rate.
Interest rates remain near 40-year lows despite recent Federal Reserve actions
and utility common stock dividends are well below their long-term average. In
2004, the Fund made increased use of realized gains to supplement its
investment income and reduced its use of short-term trading strategies designed
to capture dividend income. Until the Fund utilizes all of its tax loss
carryforwards, distributions to shareholders derived from realized gains will
be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. In addition, the reduced use of
short-term trading strategies by the Fund has lowered the Fund's portfolio
turnover rate and transaction costs. In the future, after the Fund utilizes all
of its tax loss carryforwards and, in the absence of an increase in the yields
available on Fund investments and/or realizable gains on Fund investments, the
Fund's dividend distributions may include a portion of non-taxable return of
capital in order to maintain the dividend rate.

    Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Direct Deposit Service--The Fund
has a dividend reinvestment plan available as a benefit to all registered
shareholders and also offers direct deposit service through electronic funds
transfer to all registered shareholders currently receiving a monthly

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
DNP Select Income Fund Inc.:

   We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of DNP
Select Income Fund Inc., including the schedule of investments, as of December
31, 2004, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year
then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the three years
in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based
on our audits. The financial highlights for the two years in the period ended
December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations.
Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights
in their report dated February 5, 2002.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2004, by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures
where replies from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
DNP Select Income Fund Inc. at December 31, 2004, the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the three years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               December 31, 2004

(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

   DNP SELECT INCOME FUND INC. (the "Fund") was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Maryland on November 26, 1986. The Fund commenced operations on
January 21, 1987, as a closed-end diversified management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The primary investment
objectives of the Fund are current income and long-term growth of income.
Capital appreciation is a secondary objective.

   The following are the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

      (a) The market values for securities are determined as follows: Equity
   securities traded on a national securities exchange or traded
   over-the-counter and quoted on the NASDAQ System are valued at last sales
   prices. Fixed income securities and any other securities for which it is
   determined that market prices are unavailable or inappropriate are valued at
   a fair value using a procedure determined in good faith by the Board of
   Directors which includes the use of a pricing service. Each money market
   instrument having a maturity of 60 days or less is valued on an amortized
   cost basis, which approximates market value.

      (b) Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury, U.S.
   Government Agency and other investment grade securities. All collateral is
   held by an independent third-party custodian bank on behalf of the Fund
   until maturity of the repurchase agreement. Provisions of the agreement
   provide that the market value of the collateral plus accrued interest on the
   collateral is greater than or equal to the repurchase price plus accrued
   interest at all times. In the event of a default or bankruptcy by the other
   party to the agreements, the Fund maintains the right to sell the underlying
   collateral securities at market value; however realization and/or retention
   of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

      (c) It is the Fund's policy to comply with requirements of Subchapter M
   of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies
   and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
   shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.
   The Fund intends to utilize provisions of Federal income tax laws which
   allow a realized capital loss to be carried forward for eight years
   following the year of loss. At December 31, 2004, the Fund had tax capital
   loss carryforwards of $288,053,758 of which $924,278 will expire in 2007:
   $76,055,964 will expire in 2010 and $211,073,516 will expire in 2011. These
   capital loss carryforwards will be reduced by future realized gains, whether
   or not distributed (see Note 4). The Fund incurred losses in November and
   December of $3,868,218, which will be deferred for tax purposes and treated
   as if they were incurred on January 1, 2005.

      At December 31, 2004, on a tax basis, the Fund had undistributed net
   investment income of $0 and based on a $2,776,340,015 tax cost of
   investments, gross unrealized appreciation of $365,962,302 and unrealized
   depreciation of $32,560,868. The difference between the book basis and tax
   basis of distributable earnings and cost of investments are primarily a
   result of tax deferral of wash sale losses, the accretion of market discount
   and amortization of premiums and alternative tax treatment of certain
   securities.

      Due to inherent differences in the recognition and distribution of income
   and realized gains/losses under U.S. generally accepted accounting
   principles and for federal income tax purposes, permanent

   differences between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and
   appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The
   reclassifications primarily relate to premium amortization and capital loss
   carryforwards utilized for current year distributions. These
   reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value of the Fund. At
   December 31, 2004, the following reclassifications were recorded:

</TABLE>

      (d) Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains
   or losses from sales of securities are determined on the specific identified
   cost basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest
   income and expense are recognized on the accrual basis. Discounts and
   premiums on securities are amortized over the lives of the respective
   securities for financial reporting purposes. Discounts and premiums are not
   amortized for tax purposes.

      (e) The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
   generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
   liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
   of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
   decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
   results could differ from those estimates.

(2) MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS:

   The Fund has engaged Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. (the "Adviser")
to provide professional investment management services for the Fund and has
engaged J. J. B. Hilliard, W. L. Lyons, Inc. (the "Administrator") to provide
administrative and management services for the Fund. The Adviser receives a
quarterly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the average weekly net assets of the
Fund up to $1.5 billion and .50% of average weekly net assets in excess
thereof. The Administrator receives a quarterly fee at annual rates of .25% of
average weekly net assets up to $100 million, .20% of average weekly net assets
from $100 million to $1 billion, and .10% of average weekly net assets over $1
billion. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, "average weekly net
assets" is defined as the sum of (i) the aggregate net asset value of the
Fund's common stock (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of the Fund's
preferred stock and (iii) the aggregate proceeds to the Fund of commercial
paper issued by the Fund. Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the Adviser
receive a fee of $25,000 per year plus $2,000 per board meeting, plus $1,500
per committee meeting attended. Committee Chairmen receive an additional fee of
$5,000 per year. Total fees paid to directors for the year ended December 31,
2004 were $371,727.

(3) INDEMNIFICATIONS:

   Under the Fund's organizational documents, its Officers and Directors are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other parties.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the

Fund that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or
losses pursuant to these contracts and believes the risk of loss to be remote.

(4) DIVIDENDS:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the following distributions to common
stockholders from investment income in 2004:

</TABLE>

The Fund declares and pays dividends monthly. The amount and timing of
distributions are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The tax
basis of all Fund distributions in 2003 and 2004 was ordinary income. Until the
Fund utilizes all of its tax loss carryforwards, distributions to shareholders
derived from realized gains will be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes.

(5) REMARKETED PREFERRED STOCK:

   In 1988, the Fund issued 5,000 shares of Remarketed Preferred Stock ("RP")
in five series of 1,000 shares each at a public offering price of $100,000 per
share. The underwriting discount and other expenses incurred in connection with
the issuance of the RP were recorded as a reduction of paid-in surplus on
common stock. Dividends on the RP are cumulative at a rate which was initially
established for each series at its offering. Since the initial offering of each
series, the dividend rate on each series has been reset every 49 days by a
remarketing process. Dividend rates ranged from 1.040% to 2.249% during the
year ended December 31, 2004.

   The RP is redeemable at the option of the Fund on any dividend payment date
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect
to the RP, and the RP is subject to mandatory redemption if that asset coverage
is not maintained. Each series of RP is also subject to mandatory redemption on
a date certain as follows: Series A--November 28, 2012; Series B--November 18,
2015; Series C--November 7, 2018; Series D--December 22, 2021; and Series
E--December 11, 2024.

   In general, the holders of the RP and of the Common Stock have equal voting
rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the RP, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Directors, and separate class votes
are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests of the RP
and the Common Stock. The RP has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(6) COMMERCIAL PAPER:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the Fund to issue up to $200,000,000
of Commercial Paper Notes (the "Notes") in minimum denominations of $100,000
with maturities up to 270 days. The Notes generally will be sold on a discount
basis, but may be sold on an interest-bearing basis. The Notes are not
redeemable by the Fund nor are they subject to voluntary prepayment prior to
maturity. The aggregate amount of Notes outstanding changes from time to time.
The Notes are unsecured, general obligations of the Fund. The Fund has entered
into a credit agreement to provide liquidity. The Fund is able to request loans
under the credit agreement of up to $100,000,000 at any one time, subject to
certain restrictions. Interest rates on the Notes ranged from 1.21% to 2.71%
during the year ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Fund had
Notes outstanding of $198,361,375.

(7) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS:

   For the year ended December 31, 2004, purchases and sales of investment
securities (excluding short-term securities) were $1,110,681,065 and
$1,069,959,485, respectively.

   The Fund may lend portfolio securities to a broker/dealer. Loans are
required to be secured at all times by collateral at least equal to the market
value of securities loaned. The Fund receives a portion of the income earned on
the securities held as collateral and continues to earn income on the loaned
securities. Security loans are subject to the risk of failure by the borrower
to return the loaned securities in which case the Fund could incur a loss. At
December 31, 2004, the Fund had loaned portfolio securities with a market value
of $458,937,852 to a broker/dealer and received $476,307,660 of cash
collateral. This cash was invested in securities as shown in the Schedule of
Investments.

(1)Since the adoption of FAS 150 in 2003, dividends on preferred stock are
   included in interest expense and are part of net investment income. Absent
   this change in accounting, per share net investment income and dividends on
   preferred stock would have been $.58 and $.03, respectively in 2004 and $.78
   and $.03, respectively in 2003.
(2)In 2004, the Fund reduced its use of short-term trading strategies designed
   to capture dividend income and made increased use of realized gains to
   supplement its investment income. Until the Fund utilizes all of its tax
   loss carryforwards, distributions to shareholders derived from such realized
   gains will be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. In addition, the
   reduced use of short-term trading strategies reduced the Fund's portfolio
   turnover rate during 2004.

                              Adopted May 13, 2003

          corporate restructurings, and

<PAGE>

          anti-takeover provisions such as staggered boards, poison pills, and
          supermajority voting provisions.

     C.   "Delegate" refers to the Adviser, any proxy committee to which the
          Adviser delegates its responsibilities hereunder and any qualified,
          independent organization engaged by the Adviser to vote proxies on
          behalf of the Fund.

     D.   "executive compensation matters" refers to stock option plans and
          other executive compensation issues.

     E.   "Fund" refers to DNP Select Income Fund Inc.

     F.   "portfolio holding" refers to any company or entity whose securities
          are held within the investment portfolio of the Fund as of the date a
          proxy is solicited.

     G.   "proxy contests" refer to any meeting of shareholders of an issuer for
          which there are at least two sets of proxy statements and proxy cards,
          one solicited by management and the others by a dissident or group of
          dissidents.

     H.   "social issues" refers to social, political and environmental issues.

     I.   "takeover" refers to "hostile" or "friendly" efforts to effect radical
          change in the voting control of the board of directors of a company.

II.  General policy. It is the intention of the Fund to exercise stock ownership
     rights in portfolio holdings in a manner that is reasonably anticipated to
     further the best economic interests of shareholders of the Fund.
     Accordingly, the Fund or its Delegate(s) shall endeavor to analyze and vote
     all proxies that are considered likely to have financial implications, and,
     where appropriate, to participate in corporate governance, shareholder
     proposals, management communications and legal proceedings. The Fund and
     its Delegate(s) must also identify potential or actual conflicts of
     interests in voting proxies and address any such conflict of interest in
     accordance with these Policies and Procedures.

III. Factors to consider when voting.

     A.   The Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect
          on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the portfolio
          holding is indeterminable or insignificant.

     B.   In analyzing anti-takeover measures, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
          long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
          industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,
          without limitation, five-year annual compound growth rates for sales,
          operating income, net income, and total shareholder returns (share
          price appreciation plus dividends). Other financial indicators that
          will be considered include margin analysis, cash flow, and debt
          levels.

     C.   In analyzing proxy contests for control, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
          financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
          management's track record; background to the proxy contest;
          qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation of what
          each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the
          proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership
          positions.

     D.   In analyzing contested elections for director, the Delegate shall vote
          on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as the
          qualifications of all director nominees. The Delegate shall also
          consider the independence and attendance record of board and

<PAGE>

          key committee members. A review of the corporate governance profile
          shall be completed highlighting entrenchment devices that may reduce
          accountability.

     E.   In analyzing corporate governance matters, the Delegate shall vote on
          a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as tax and
          economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
          incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
          changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
          supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and
          bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

     F.   In analyzing executive compensation matters, the Delegate shall vote
          on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as
          executive pay and spending on perquisites, particularly in conjunction
          with sub-par performance and employee layoffs.

     G.   The Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder proposals on
          social issues, except where the Delegate determines that a different
          position would be in the clear economic interests of the Fund and its
          shareholders.

IV.  Responsibilities of Delegates.

     A.   In voting proxies on behalf of the Fund, each Delegate shall have a
          duty of care to safeguard the best interests of the Fund and its
          shareholders and to act in accordance with these Policies and
          Procedures.

     B.   The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
          committee established from time to time by the Adviser and may engage
          one or more qualified, independent organizations to vote proxies on
          behalf of the Fund. The Adviser shall be responsible for the ensuring
          that any such Delegate is informed of and complies with these Policies
          and Procedures.

     C.   No Delegate shall accept direction or inappropriate influence from any
          other client or third party, or from any director, officer or employee
          of any affiliated company, and shall not cast any vote inconsistent
          with these Policies and Procedures without obtaining the prior
          approval of the Board of Directors of the Fund or its duly authorized
          representative.

V.   Conflicts of interest

     A.   The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived
          conflicts of interest in the voting of proxies for portfolio holdings
          between the interests of Fund shareholders, on the one hand, and those
          of the Adviser or any affiliated person of the Fund or the Adviser, on
          the other hand. The Board of Directors may take into account a wide
          array of factors in determining whether such a conflict exists,
          whether such conflict is material in nature, and how to properly
          address or resolve the same.

     B.   While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
          presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of
          Directors or its duly authorized representative may take the following
          actions, among others, or otherwise give weight to the following
          factors, in addressing material conflicts of interest in voting (or
          directing Delegates to vote) proxies pertaining to portfolio holdings:
          (i) vote pursuant to the recommendation of the proposing Delegate;
          (ii) abstain from voting; or (iii) rely on the recommendations of an
          established, independent third party with qualifications to vote
          proxies, such as Institutional Shareholder Services.

     C.   The Adviser shall promptly notify the Board of Directors of the Fund
          promptly after becoming aware that any actual or potential conflict of
          interest exists and shall seek the Board of Directors' recommendations
          for protecting the best interests of Fund's

<PAGE>

          shareholders. The Adviser shall not waive any conflict of interest or
          vote any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the
          Board of Directors or its duly authorized representative.

VI.  Miscellaneous.

     A.   A copy of the current Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures and the
          voting records for the Fund, reconciling proxies with portfolio
          holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
          justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and
          available for inspection either physically or through electronic
          posting on an approved website.

     B.   In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under these
          Policies and Procedures is requested at a time other than a regularly
          scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Audit
          Committee shall be the duly authorized representative of the Board of
          Directors with the authority and responsibility to interpret and apply
          these Policies and Procedures and shall provide a report of his or her
          determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of
          Directors.

     C.   The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from
          this Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the
          Board of Directors and shall provide such other reports as the Board
          of Directors may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide
          to the Fund or any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy
          voting pursuant to this Statement of Policy at such times and in such
          format or medium as the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser
          shall be solely responsible for complying with the disclosure and
          reporting requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
          including, without limitation, Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
          Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser shall gather, collate and present
          information relating to the its proxy voting activities of those of
          each Delegate in such format and medium as the Fund shall determine
          from time to time in order for the Fund to discharge its disclosure
          and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment
          Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     D.   The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
          portfolio holdings pursuant to these Policies and Procedures and
          assisting the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which
          such proxies were voted.

     E.   In performing its duties hereunder, any Delegate may engage the
          services of a research and/or voting adviser, the cost of which shall
          be borne by such Delegate.

     F.   These Policies and Procedures shall be presented to the Board of
          Directors annually for their amendment and/or approval.

     Act.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

          No changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend
     nominees to the registrant's board of directors have been implemented after

     Statement dated March 1, 2004) or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

          (a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal

     and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")) are effective, based on an evaluation of
     those controls and procedures made as of a date within 90 days of the
     filing date of this report as required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act
     and Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.

          (b) There has been no change in the registrant's internal control over
     financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) that
     occurred during the second fiscal quarter of the fiscal half-year covered
