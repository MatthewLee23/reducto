ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

The Report to Shareholders is attached herewith.



                                                                  [LOGO OMITTED]

                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2004



TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com/funds.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2004.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  ORGANIZATION.  The Gabelli Utility Trust (the "Utility Trust" or the "Fund")
is a closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment company organized as a
Delaware  statutory  trust  on  February  25,  1999  and  registered  under  the
Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940  Act"),  whose  primary
objective is long-term  growth of capital and income.  The Utility  Trust had no
operations  prior to July 9,  1999,  other  than the sale of  10,000  shares  of
beneficial  interest for $100,000 to The Gabelli  Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity
Trust") at $10.00 per share.  On July 9, 1999,  the Utility  Trust had a 4 for 3
stock split making the balance of Utility  Trust shares held by the Equity Trust
as 13,333. On July 9, 1999, the Equity Trust contributed $79,487,260 in cash and
securities  in exchange  for shares of the Utility  Trust,  and on the same date
distributed  such shares to Equity Trust  shareholders of record on July 1, 1999
at the rate of one share of the Utility Trust for every ten shares of the Equity
Trust. Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

     Effective  August 1, 2002, the Utility Trust  modified its  non-fundamental
investment  policy to increase,  from 65% to 80%, the portion of its assets that
it will  invest,  under normal  market  conditions,  in common  stocks and other
securities  of foreign and domestic  companies  involved in providing  products,
services or equipment for (i) the generation or distribution of electricity, gas
and water and (ii) telecommunications services or infrastructure operations (the
"80% Policy").

     The 80% Policy may be changed without shareholder  approval.  However,  the
Utility Trust has adopted a policy to provide  shareholders with notice at least
60 days prior to the implementation of any change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good faith,  to reflect its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are  generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close of the foreign  markets,  but prior to the close
of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change
significantly,  certain  foreign  securities  may be  fair  valued  pursuant  to
procedures  established  by the  Board.  Debt  instruments  that are not  credit
impaired  with  remaining  maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost,  unless the Board  determines such does not reflect the  securities'  fair
value,  in which  case  these  securities  will be valued at their fair value as
determined by the Board. Debt instruments having a maturity greater than 60 days
for which  market  quotations  are  readily  available  are valued at the latest
average of the bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on
such day, the security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts
are valued at the closing  settlement price of the exchange or board of trade on
which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under  procedures
established by and under the general  supervision  of the Board.  Fair valuation
methodologies  and procedures may include,  but are not limited to: analysis and
review of available  financial and non-financial  information about the company;
comparisons  to the  valuation  and changes in valuation of similar  securities,
including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value
ADR  securities at the close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other
information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

     REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.   The  Utility  Trust  may  enter  into  repurchase
agreements with primary government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal
Reserve  Board,  with member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System or with other
brokers or dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the Adviser and
reviewed by the Board.  Under the terms of a typical repurchase  agreement,  the
Utility Trust takes  possession of an underlying debt  obligation  subject to an
obligation of the seller to  repurchase,  and the Utility  Trust to resell,  the
obligation  at an  agreed-upon  price and time,  thereby  determining  the yield
during the Utility Trust's holding period. The Utility Trust will always receive
and maintain  securities as collateral  whose market  value,  including  accrued
interest,  will be at least equal to 100% of the dollar  amount  invested by the
Utility  Trust in each  agreement.  The Utility Trust will make payment for such
securities  only upon physical  delivery or upon evidence of book entry transfer
of the  collateral  to the  account of the  custodian.  To the  extent  that any
repurchase  transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is
marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral. If
the seller  defaults and the value of the  collateral  declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Utility Trust may be delayed or limited.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The books and records of the Utility Trust
are maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments
and other  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars  at the
exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period,  and purchases and sales of
investment  securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing on the respective  dates of such  transactions.  Unrealized gains and
losses,  which result from changes in foreign  exchange  rates and/or changes in
market    prices   of    securities,    have   been   included   in   unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency translations.  Net
realized  foreign  currency gains and losses  resulting from changes in exchange
rates  include  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  between  trade  date  and
settlement  date  on  investment  securities   transactions,   foreign  currency
transactions  and the  difference  between the amounts of interest and dividends
recorded on the books of the Utility  Trust and the amounts  actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Utility Trust may directly purchase securities of
foreign  issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves  special
risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The
risks include  possible  revaluation  of  currencies,  the ability to repatriate
funds, less complete  financial  information about companies and possible future
adverse  political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many
foreign  issuers  and their  markets  may be less  liquid and their  prices more
volatile than those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

     DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions to shareholders
are recorded on the  ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and capital gain
distributions  are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from that determined under U.S. generally  accepted  accounting
principles. Distributions to Shareholders of the Utility Trust's 5.625% Series A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock and Series B Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock
("Cumulative  Preferred  Stock") are accrued on a daily basis and are determined
as described in Note 5.

     For the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  reclassifications  were  made to
decrease accumulated  distributions in excess of net investment income by $3,970
and to  increase  accumulated  net  realized  loss on  investments  and  foreign
currency transactions by $3,970.

     The tax  character  of  distributions  paid  during the  fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were as follows:

     PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The  Utility  Trust  intends to  continue to
qualify as a regulated  investment  company  under  Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended.  It is the Fund's  policy to comply with the
requirements  of the Internal  Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment
companies  and to distribute  substantially  all of its net  investment  company
taxable income and net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income
taxes is required.

     Dividends and interest from non-U.S.  sources received by the Utility Trust
are generally subject to non-U.S.  withholding taxes at rates ranging up to 30%.
Such  withholding  taxes  may be  reduced  or  eliminated  under  the  terms  of
applicable U.S. income tax treaties,  and the Utility Trust intends to undertake
any procedural steps required to claim the benefits of such treaties.

     As of December 31, 2004, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

    Net unrealized appreciation on
      investments and foreign currency .............. $29,457,600
    Dividends payable ...............................     (28,733)

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Utility Trust has entered
into an  investment  advisory  agreement  (the  "Advisory  Agreement")  with the
Adviser which  provides that the Utility Trust will pay the Adviser on the first
business day of each month a fee for the previous month equal on an annual basis
to 1.00% of the value of the  Utility  Trust's  average  weekly net assets  plus
liquidation value of preferred stock. In accordance with the Advisory Agreement,
the Adviser  provides a continuous  investment  program for the Utility  Trust's
portfolio and oversees the  administration of all aspects of the Utility Trust's
business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee on the
incremental assets attributable to each series of the Cumulative Preferred Stock
if the total  return of the net asset value of the common  shares of the Utility
Trust, including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not
exceed the stated dividend rate of the respective Cumulative Preferred Stock for
the year.

     The  Utility  Trust's  total  return on the net asset  value of the  common
shares is monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the
net asset value of the common  shares  exceeds the stated  dividend  rate of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Utility  Trust's  total  return on the net asset value of the common  shares
exceeded the stated  dividend rate of all  outstanding  Preferred  Stock.  Thus,
management fees were accrued on these assets.

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, Gabelli & Company,  Inc. ("Gabelli
&  Company"),  an  affiliate  of the  Adviser,  received  $137,599 in  brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Utility Trust.

     In connection with the 2003 and 2004 Rights Offering ("Rights"), holders of
unexercised  rights to purchase  common shares of the Utility Trust were able to
instruct the Subscription Agent (EquiServe Trust Company) to sell such Rights on
their behalf.  The Subscription Agent was permitted to effect such sales through
Gabelli & Company,  unless the Subscription  Agent was able to negotiate a lower
commission  rate with an independent  broker.  Total  commissions  from sales of
Rights effected by the Subscription  Agent through Gabelli & Company amounted to
$22,630  and  $21,882  for  the  years  ended   December   31,  2003  and  2004,
respectively.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


     The cost of calculating  the Utility Trust's net asset value per share is a
Trust expense pursuant to the Investment  Advisory  Agreement  between the Trust
and the Adviser.  During the year ended  December 31,  2004,  the Utility  Trust
reimbursed  the Adviser  $34,800 in  connection  with the cost of computing  the
Trust's net asset value.

     The Trust is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer  in the  amount of $1,538  for the  period of
October 1, 2004 through  December 31, 2004 which is included in payroll  expense
on the Statement of Operations.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.   Cost  of  purchases  and  proceeds  from  sales  of
securities,  other than short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31,
2004 aggregated $69,810,451 and $28,560,536, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The Board of the Utility Trust has authorized the repurchase of its
shares on the open  market  when the shares are  trading at a discount of 10% or
more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may  determine  from time to time)
from the net asset value of the shares. During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Utility Trust did not  repurchase  any shares of beneficial  interest in the
open market.

     On October 20, 2004, the Utility Trust  distributed one transferable  right
for each of the 23,118,091  common shares  outstanding to shareholders of record
on that date. Four rights were required to purchase one additional  common share
at the subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders who exercised their
full  primary   subscription  rights  were  eligible  for  an  over-subscription
privilege  entitling  them to subscribe,  subject to certain  limitations  and a
pro-rata  allotment,  for any  additional  shares not purchased  pursuant to the
primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as authorized by the Board in
accordance with the registration  statement.  The subscription period expired on
November 24, 2004. The rights  offering was fully  subscribed,  having  received
over-subscription  requests  in  excess  of the  shares  available  for  primary
subscription  resulting in the issuance of 5,779,546  common shares and proceeds
of  $40,456,822  to the  Utility  Trust,  prior to the  deduction  of  estimated
expenses of $475,000.  The net asset value per share of the Utility Trust common
shareholders  was  reduced by  approximately  $0.06 per share as a result of the
issuance of shares below net asset value.

     On August 20, 2003, the Utility Trust  distributed one  transferable  right
for each of the 15,298,490  common shares  outstanding to shareholders of record
on that date. Three rights were required to purchase one additional common share
at the subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders who exercised their
full  primary   subscription  rights  were  eligible  for  an  over-subscription
privilege  entitling  them to subscribe,  subject to certain  limitations  and a
pro-rata  allotment,  for any  additional  shares not purchased  pursuant to the
primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as authorized by the Board in
accordance with the registration  statement.  The subscription period expired on
September 25, 2003. The rights offering was fully and over-subscribed  resulting
in the issuance of 7,500,000  common shares and proceeds of  $52,500,000  to the
Utility  Trust,  prior to the  deduction of expenses of $534,089.  The net asset
value per  share of the  Utility  Trust  common  shareholders  was  enhanced  by
approximately  $0.12 per share as a result of the  issuance of shares  above net
asset value.

     Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

     On July 31, 2003,  the Utility Trust  received net proceeds of  $28,877,500
(after  underwriting  discounts of $945,000  and offering  expenses of $169,949)
from the public  offering  of  1,200,000  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative
Preferred Stock. Commencing July 31, 2008 and thereafter,  the Utility Trust, at
its option,  may redeem the 5.625% Series A Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole
or in part at the  liquidation  value price.  During the year ended December 31,
2004, the Utility Trust repurchased  15,800 shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock in the open market at a cost of $364,714 and an average discount
of  approximately  7.72% from its  liquidation  value of $25.00  per share.  All
repurchased  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  have been
retired.  At  December  31,  2004,  1,184,200  shares  of the  5.625%  Series  A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$23,129.

     On July 31, 2003,  the Utility Trust  received net proceeds of  $24,572,500
(after  underwriting  discounts of $250,000  and offering  expenses of $169,949)
from the public  offering of 1,000  shares of Series B Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is
generally held every 7 days, is expected to vary with short-term interest rates.
The rates of Series B Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from 1.05%
to 2.69% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Existing  shareholders may submit
an order to hold, bid or sell such shares on each auction date. Series B Auction
Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  shareholders  may also  trade  shares in the
secondary  market.  The Utility  Trust,  at its option,  may redeem the Series B
Auction

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


     Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in  whole or in part at the  liquidation
value price at any time.  During the year ended  December 31, 2004,  the Utility
Trust did not redeem any shares of Series B Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  At  December  31,  2004,  1,000  shares  of the  Series B  Auction  Rate
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of
2.69 percent per share and accrued dividends amounted to $5,604.

     The  Utility  Trust is required  by the 1940 Act and by the  Statements  of
Preference to meet certain asset  coverage  tests with respect to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock. If the Utility Trust fails to meet these  requirements and does
not correct such failure,  the Utility Trust may be required to redeem,  in part
or in full, the 5.625% Series A and Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock at a redemption price of $25.00 and $25,000,  respectively, per share plus
an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid dividends  whether or not declared
on such  shares in order to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to
meet the  foregoing  asset  coverage  requirements  could  restrict  the Utility
Trust's ability to pay dividends to common  shareholders and could lead to sales
of portfolio securities at inopportune times.

     The holders of Cumulative  Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the holders of Common Stock (one vote per share) and will vote together
with holders of shares of Common Stock as a single class. In addition,  the 1940
Act  requires  that along with  approval  of a majority of the holders of Common
Stock,  approval  of a  majority  of the  holders of any  outstanding  shares of
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization  that would adversely affect the Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security  holders,
including,  among other things, changes in the Utility Trust's subclassification
as a  closed-end  investment  company or changes in its  fundamental  investment
restrictions.  The income  received on the Utility  Trust's assets may vary in a
manner  unrelated  to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
common shareholders.

     Under  Emerging   Issues  Task  Force  (EITF)   promulgating   Topic  D-98,
Classification  and  Measurement of Redeemable  Securities,  which was issued on
July 19, 2001, preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets
are to be  classified  outside  of  permanent  equity  to the  extent  that  the
redemption is at a fixed or  determinable  price and at the option of the holder
or upon the  occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the
issuer.  Subject to the  guidance of the EITF,  the Utility  Trust's  Cumulative
Preferred Stock has been  reclassified  outside of permanent  equity (net assets
attributable  to  common  stock  shareholders)  in  the  accompanying  financial
statements.

6. INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION. Because the Utility Trust primarily invests in common
stocks and other  securities  of foreign and  domestic  companies in the utility
industry,  its portfolio may be subject to greater risk and market  fluctuations
than a portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund  shares  trading  practices.  Gabelli  Asset  Management  Inc.,  the
Adviser's  parent company,  is responding to these  requests.  The Utility Trust
does not believe that these matters will have a material  adverse  effect on the
Utility Trust's financial position or the results of its operations.

8.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Utility  Trust enters into  contracts  that contain a
variety of  indemnifications.  The Utility Trust's maximum  exposure under these
arrangements is unknown.  However, the Utility Trust has not had prior claims or
losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Utility Trust:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of The Gabelli  Utility Trust (the
"Trust") at December 31, 2004,  the results of its  operations for the year then
ended,  the  changes  in its net  assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the
United States of America.  These financial  statements and financial  highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the responsibility of the
Trust's  management;  our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on these
financial  statements  based on our  audits.  We  conducted  our audits of these
financial  statements  in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe  that our  audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  securities  at
December 31, 2004 by  correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

   It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust  ("Utility  Trust")  to
automatically   reinvest   dividends.   As  a   "registered"   shareholder   you
automatically  become a participant in the Utility  Trust's  Automatic  Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan authorizes the Utility Trust to issue
shares to participants  upon an income dividend or a capital gains  distribution
regardless  of whether  the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to net
asset value. All  distributions  to shareholders  whose shares are registered in
their  own  names  will be  automatically  reinvested  pursuant  to the  Plan in
additional  shares of the Utility Trust.  Plan participants may send their stock
certificates  to  EquiServe  Trust  Company  ("EquiServe")  to be held in  their
dividend reinvestment account.  Registered shareholders wishing to receive their
distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                            The Gabelli Utility Trust
                                  c/o EquiServe
                                 P.O. Box 43011
                            Providence, RI 02940-3011

   Shareholders  requesting  this cash election  must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan may contact EquiServe at (800) 336-6983.

   SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must do
so in writing or by telephone. Please submit your request to the above mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

   If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or nominee,  you should
contact such institution.  If such institution is not participating in the Plan,
your account will be credited with a cash  dividend.  In order to participate in
the Plan through  such  institution,  it may be  necessary  for you to have your
shares  taken out of  "street  name" and  re-registered  in your own name.  Once
registered in your own name your  dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested.
Certain brokers participate in the Plan.  Shareholders holding shares in "street
name"  at   participating   institutions   will  have  dividends   automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

   The number of shares of Common Stock  distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner. Under the Plan,
whenever  the market  price of the Utility  Trust's  Common Stock is equal to or
exceeds  net  asset  value  at the  time  shares  are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of Common Stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Utility Trust's Common Stock. The valuation
date is the dividend or distribution  payment date or, if that date is not a New
York Stock Exchange trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of
the Common Stock at the time of valuation exceeds the market price of the Common
Stock,  participants will receive shares from the Utility Trust valued at market
price.  If the  Utility  Trust  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution  payable only in cash,  EquiServe will buy Common Stock in the open
market,  or on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,  for the  participants'
accounts, except that EquiServe will endeavor to terminate purchases in the open
market  and  cause the  Utility  Trust to issue  shares  at net asset  value if,
following the  commencement  of such  purchases,  the market value of the Common
Stock exceeds the then current net asset value.

   The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will
not  relieve  participants  of any  income  tax  which  may be  payable  on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

   The  Utility  Trust  reserves  the  right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as
applied to any voluntary  cash  payments  made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan
at least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by EquiServe on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   The Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan is yet another vehicle for our  shareholders
to increase their  investment in the Utility  Trust.  In order to participate in
the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan, shareholders must have their shares registered
in their own name.

   Participants  in the  Voluntary  Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe for  investments  in the Utility  Trust's
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  EquiServe will use these funds to purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  EquiServe  will charge each
shareholder  who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata  share of the  brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary  cash payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43011,  Providence,  RI
02940-3011  such that  EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately  10 days
before  the 1st and 15th of the  month.  Funds not  received  at least five days
before the investment date shall be held for investment in the following period.
A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is received by EquiServe at
least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

   For more information  regarding the Dividend  Reinvestment Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Utility Trust.

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>


                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------





         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt  written  policies and  procedures  governing  the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Investors,  Inc., Gabelli Funds,
LLC and Gabelli Advisers, Inc.  (collectively,  the "Advisers") to determine how
to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio  securities  held by  their  clients,
including the  procedures  that the Advisers use when a vote presents a conflict
between the interests of the  shareholders  of an investment  company managed by
one of the Advisers,  on the one hand, and those of the Advisers;  the principal
underwriter;  or any affiliated person of the investment company,  the Advisers,
or the principal underwriter. These procedures will not apply where the Advisers
do not have voting discretion or where the Advisers have agreed with a client to
vote the client's  proxies in accordance with specific  guidelines or procedures
supplied by the client (to the extent permitted by ERISA).

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

     The Proxy  Voting  Committee  was  originally  formed in April 1989 for the
purpose of formulating  guidelines  and reviewing  proxy  statements  within the
parameters set by the substantive proxy voting guidelines  originally  published
by GAMCO Investors,  Inc. in 1988 and updated periodically,  a copy of which are
appended as Exhibit A. The Committee will include  representatives  of Research,
Administration,  Legal, and the Advisers.  Additional or replacement  members of
the  Committee  will be  nominated  by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire
Committee. As of December 31, 2004, the members are:



                  Bruce N. Alpert, Chief Operating Officer of Gabelli Funds, LLC

                  Ivan Arteaga, Portfolio Manager

                  Caesar M. P. Bryan, Portfolio Manager

                  Stephen DeTore, Deputy General Counsel

                  Joshua Fenton, Director of Buy-Side Research

                  Douglas R. Jamieson, Chief Operating Officer of GAMCO

                  James E. McKee, General Counsel

                  Karyn-Marie Prylucki, Director of Proxy Voting Services
<PAGE>

                  William S. Selby, Managing Director of GAMCO

                  Howard F. Ward, Portfolio Manager

                  Peter D. Zaglio, Senior Vice President

         Peter D. Zaglio  currently  chairs the Committee.  In his absence,  the
Director of Research will chair the Committee. Meetings are held on an as needed
basis to form views on the manner in which the  Advisers  should vote proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         In general,  the  Director of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using the Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters  identified by the Chairman of the Committee,  the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         For matters  submitted to the  Committee,  each member of the Committee
will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the proxy statement,  any relevant
third party  research,  a summary of any views provided by the Chief  Investment
Officer and any recommendations by Gabelli & Company,  Inc. analysts.  The Chief
Investment  Officer or the Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  analysts  may be invited to
present  their  viewpoints.  If the Legal  Department  believes  that the matter
before the  committee  is one with  respect to which a conflict of interest  may
exist between the Advisers and their clients, counsel will provide an opinion to
the  Committee  concerning  the  conflict.  If the  matter  is one in which  the
interests of the clients of one or more of Advisers may diverge, counsel will so
advise and the  Committee  may make  different  recommendations  as to different
clients.  For any matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
counsel will provide an opinion  concerning  the likely risks and merits of such
an appraisal action.

         Each matter  submitted to the Committee  will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of
the Committee  will cast the deciding  vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy  Guidelines  express the normal  preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment  guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.
<PAGE>

         If  the  vote  cast  either  by  the  analyst  or as a  result  of  the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation
of the Board of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine  whether an amendment to the most recently  filed  Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II. SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III. CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any  change  in voting  authority,  the  following  should  be  notified  by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations

         - Legal Department

         - Proxy Department

         - Investment professional assigned to the account

         In the event that the Board of  Directors  (or a Committee  thereof) of
one or more of the  investment  companies  managed  by one of the  Advisers  has
retained  direct voting control over any security,  the Proxy Voting  Department
will provide each Board  Member (or  Committee  member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV. VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting  Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients.  The Advisers' staff may request proxy-voting
records for use in presentations to current or prospective clients. Requests for
proxy voting records should be made at least ten days prior to client meetings.

         If a client  wishes to receive a proxy  voting  record on a  quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual  basis,  please notify the Proxy Voting  Department.  The
reports will be available for mailing  approximately  ten days after the quarter
end of the period.  First  quarter  reports may be delayed  since the end of the
quarter falls during the height of the proxy season.
<PAGE>

         A letter  is sent to the  custodians  for all  clients  for  which  the
Advisers  have  voting  responsibility  instructing  them to  forward  all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]

                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department

                  One Corporate Center

                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V. VOTING PROCEDURES



1. Custodian banks,  outside brokerage firms and First Clearing  Corporation are
responsible for forwarding proxies directly to GAMCO.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms (VAFs) - Issued by ADP. VAFs must be
     voted through the issuing institution causing a time lag. ADP is an outside
     service contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.
o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In the case of a  discrepancy  such as an  incorrect  number  of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions from the proxy committee, the votes are cast and
recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Since  January 1, 1992,  records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.
The  system  is backed  up  regularly.  From 1990  through  1991,  records  were
maintained  on the PROXY  VOTER  system and in hardcopy  format.  Prior to 1990,
records were maintained on diskette and in hardcopy format.

PROXY EDGE records include:

         Security Name and Cusip Number

         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)

         Client Name
<PAGE>

         Adviser or Fund Account Number

         Directors' Recommendation

         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue

         The rationale for the vote when it is appropriate

Records prior to the institution of the PROXY EDGE system include:

         Security name

         Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)

         Date of Meeting

         Name of Custodian

         Name of Client

         Custodian Account Number

         Adviser or Fund Account Number

         Directors' recommendation

         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue

         Date the proxy statement was received and by whom

         Name of person posting the vote

         Date and method by which the vote was cast

o    From these records individual client proxy voting records are compiled.  It
     is our policy to provide  institutional  clients with a proxy voting record
     during client reviews. In addition, we will supply a proxy voting record at
     the request of the client on a quarterly,  semi-annual or annual basis.  On
     an annual  basis,  all  registered  investment  companies  file their Proxy
     Voting History for the period July 1 - June 30 on Form N-PX.

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by ADP are always sent directly
to a specific individual at ADP.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to ADP up until the time of the meeting. This is followed
     up by mailing the original form.
<PAGE>

o    When a  solicitor  has been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
   entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o Banks and brokerage firms using the services at ADP:
  A call is  placed  to ADP  requesting  legal  proxies.  The VAFs are then sent
  overnight to ADP. ADP issues  individual legal proxies and sends them back via
  overnight. A lead-time of at least two weeks prior to the meeting is needed to
  do this. Alternatively,  the procedures detailed below for banks not using ADP
  may be implemented.

o Banks and brokerage  firms issuing  proxies  directly:
  The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o A limited Power of Attorney appointing the attendee an Adviser representative.

o A list of all shares being voted by custodian  only.  Client names and account
  numbers are not included. This list must be presented, along with the proxies,
  to the Inspectors of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least one-half hour prior
  to the scheduled start of the meeting.  The tabulator must "qualify" the votes
  (i.e.  determine if the vote have previously been cast, if the votes have been
  rescinded, etc. votes have previously been cast, etc.).

o A sample ERISA and Individual contract.

o A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.

o A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

<PAGE>


                            GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GABELLI ASSET  MANAGEMENT  INC. to vote in the best economic
interests of our clients. As we state in our Magna Carta of Shareholders Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Historical  responsiveness  to shareholders
           This may include such areas as:

           -Paying greenmail

           -Failure  to  adopt  shareholder resolutions receiving a  majority of
            shareholder votes

o        Qualifications
o        Nominating committee in place
o        Number of outside directors on the board
o        Attendance at meetings
o        Overall performance


                              SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for auditors.

                           BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.
<PAGE>

                                CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place, we will generally not support attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.

                        INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Future use of additional shares
           -Stock split

           -Stock option or other executive compensation plan

           -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet

           -Aid in restructuring

           -Improve credit rating

           -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense

o        Amount of stock currently authorized but not yet issued or reserved for
         stock option plans
o        Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect


We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.

                               CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.
<PAGE>

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.

                     DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.

                            EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.

                              FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                                GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by- case basis.

NOTE:  CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.

                            ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.
<PAGE>

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.

                CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                   MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.

                                 MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.

                                NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

                       OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o        State of Incorporation
o        Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o        Other mitigating factors
<PAGE>
                                   POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.

                                 REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.

                               STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o        Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o        Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o        Method of payment
o        Amount of  stock  already  authorized but not yet issued under existing
         stock option plans


                         SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.

I, Bruce N. Alpert, certify that:

1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The Gabelli Utility Trust;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed

              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control  over  financial   reporting  that  occurred   during  the
              registrant's  second fiscal  quarter of the period covered by this
              report that has materially  affected,  or is reasonably  likely to
              materially   affect,   the  registrant's   internal  control  over
              financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
