CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds, for the period ending April 30, 2005.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Funds' investments,
and their unaudited financial statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide current income exempt from
regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific fund, current income
exempt from that state's income taxes.

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds because our experience and
research indicate strongly that this maturity range has historically offered the
best risk/reward profile on the yield curve, providing much of the return of
longer-term bonds -- with less volatility and risk.

We believe that our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax-exempt current income over
the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

PETER SUNDMAN
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
CALIFORNIA INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL FUND INC.

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS Portfolio Commentaries

We are pleased to report that, on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, all three of
Neuberger Berman's Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds delivered positive
returns and materially outperformed the Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index in
the first half of fiscal 2005.

Intermediate-term municipal bonds followed the performance pattern of the broad
bond market during this six-month reporting period, with prices remaining
relatively stable from November 2004 through January 2005, declining in February
and March, and then rallying in April. The February/March sell-off reflected
growing investor concern that the still strong economy would reignite
inflationary fires and force the Federal Reserve to tighten more aggressively.
The April rally of this year came on the back of statistical and anecdotal
evidence that the economy was slowing.

The strong economy of recent years has bolstered most municipal issuers' balance
sheets. In fact, according to Standard & Poor's, first-quarter 2005 was the
first quarter in five years during which municipal bond credit upgrades
outnumbered downgrades. Although new issuance of municipal bonds was erratic due
to changing market conditions, supply and demand remained relatively well
balanced. Also, with the yield on a 10-Year AAA rated municipal bond now at 87%
of the 10-Year Treasury yield, municipal securities appear attractively priced
relative to Treasuries.

Although fundamentals have improved, there are several issues clouding the
outlook for municipal bonds. Underfunded pension plans, which have recently made
negative headlines in the corporate world (General Motors and United Airlines),
will likely call attention to municipal issuers that have failed to put aside
enough money to cover benefits for their retiring workers. Consequently,
evaluating municipal issuers' pension fund assets and liabilities has become
even more critical in our credit analysis. A political dialogue about
overhauling the tax system could also cast a shadow over municipal securities in
the short term. We note that despite periodic political groundswells calling for
revamping the increasingly complex tax system, no administration has mustered
the political support necessary to make significant changes. So, while an
overhaul of the tax system is on President Bush's "to do" list, we are skeptical
that a major change will happen. We would also point out that whenever there has
been a spirited national debate on this issue, it has been an opportunistic time
to buy municipal securities.

Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on Federal Reserve policy and economic
data relating to inflation. If the economy settles into a slower growth path,
the municipal bond market could withstand additional "measured" Fed rate hikes
to get short-term interest rates back to "normalized" levels. If inflation
proves to be more of a problem than policy-makers currently anticipate, fixed
income securities are more vulnerable. In this uncertain environment, we are
maintaining our "safety first" duration posture, keeping our weighted average
durations shorter than the benchmark's.

     Municipal Fund Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal
     Fund Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", collectively, the
     "Funds") are valued daily by obtaining bid price quotations from
     independent pricing services on all securities available in each service's
     data base. For all other securities requiring daily quotations, bid prices
     are obtained from principal market makers in those securities or, if
     quotations are not available, by a method the Funds' Board of Directors
     believes accurately reflects fair value. Numerous factors may be considered
     when determining the fair value of a security, including available analyst,
     media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer
     of the security being fair valued has other securities outstanding.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.

##   At April 30, 2005, selected Fund information on a U.S. Federal income tax
     basis was as follows:

@    At time of investment, municipal securities purchased by the Funds are
     within the four highest rating categories (with respect to at least 80% of
     total assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating
     organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
     Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where not rated, are
     determined by the Funds' investment manager to be of comparable quality.
     Approximately 79%, 74%, and 56% of the municipal securities held by
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, have credit
     enhancement features backing them, which the Funds may rely on, such as
     letters of credit, insurance, or guarantees. Without these credit
     enhancement features the securities may or may not meet the quality
     standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported by securities in
     escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, or
     instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay the periodic
     interest due and the principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give the Funds
     the right to sell back the issue on the date specified.

++   Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

**   Security exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. These
     securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration, normally
     to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and are deemed liquid. At
     April 30, 2005, these securities amounted to $4,507,000 or 1.44% of net
     assets for Intermediate.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund
     Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", collectively, the "Funds") were
     organized as Maryland corporations on July 29, 2002. California and New
     York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end management investment
     companies and Intermediate is registered as a diversified, closed-end
     management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended. Each Fund's Board of Directors may classify or re-classify any
     unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred
     stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income, including accretion of
     discount (adjusted for original issue discount, where applicable) and
     amortization of premium, where applicable, is recorded on the accrual
     basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded
     on the basis of identified cost and stated in the Statements of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: Each Fund is treated as a separate entity for U.S.
     Federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to continue to
     qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
     requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
     regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
     earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income or excise tax
     provision is required.

     Income dividends and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
     accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to
     differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
     held by each Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of
     distributions made by each Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2004, there were no permanent differences
     resulting from different book and tax accounting reclassified at year end.

                                       28

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
     2004 and 2003 was as follows:

</TABLE>

     As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as follows:

</TABLE>

     The difference between book basis and tax basis is attributable primarily
     to timing differences of distribution payments.

     To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be offset
     by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not to
     distribute such gains. As determined at October 31, 2004, the Funds had
     unused capital loss carryforwards available for Federal income tax purposes
     to offset net realized capital gains, if any, as follows:

5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net of
     expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to
     declare and pay distributions to common shareholders from net investment
     income on a monthly basis. Distributions from net realized capital gains,
     if any, are normally distributed in December. Income dividends and capital
     gain distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
     date. Dividends and distributions to preferred shareholders are accrued and
     determined as described in Note A-7.

     Subsequent to April 30, 2005, each Fund declared two monthly distributions
     to common shareholders payable June 15, 2005 and July 15, 2005, to
     shareholders of record on May 26, 2005 and June 27, 2005, respectively,
     with ex-dividend dates of May 24, 2005 and June 23, 2005, respectively, as
     follows:

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund. Expenses
     borne by the complex of related investment companies, which includes
     open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management serves as
     investment manager, that are not directly attributed to a Fund, are
     allocated among the Funds and the other investment companies in the complex
     or series thereof, on the basis of relative net assets, except where a more
     appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds re-classified
     unissued shares of capital stock into several series of Auction Market
     Preferred Shares ("AMPS"), as follows:

     All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000
     per share plus any accumulated unpaid distributions, whether or not earned
     or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation
     Value"). Distributions to AMPS shareholders, which are cumulative, are
     accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay distributions every 7
     days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28 days for each Fund's AMPS
     Series B, unless in a special rate period.

     In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset every
     7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an auction.
     Each Fund has approved a special rate period for its AMPS Series A of 728
     days for California and New York and 546 days for Intermediate. The
     effective dates and distribution rates for each Fund are as follows:

</TABLE>

     The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part, on
     the second business day preceding any distribution payment date at
     Liquidation Value.

     The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
     Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
     declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
     shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation
     Value.

     The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common stock as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the Funds'
     charter. The holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a separate class, are
     entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a
     majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund failed to pay distributions
     on AMPS for two consecutive years.

8    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
     held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
     developments, including those particular to a specific industry or region.
     The investment policies of California and New York involve investing
     substantially all of their assets in municipal bonds of issuers located in
     the state of California and the state of New York, respectively. This
     policy makes those Funds more susceptible to adverse economic, political,
     regulatory or other factors affecting the issuers of such municipal bonds
     than a fund that does not limit its investments to such issuers.

9    INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Funds' organizational
     documents provide that their officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Funds. In addition, both in some of their principal service contracts and
     in the normal course of their business, the Funds enter into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against each Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the following annual
     rates:

                 2008                                         0.20
                 2009                                         0.15
                 2010                                         0.10
                 2011                                         0.05
</TABLE>

     Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
     31, 2011.

     For the six months ended April 30, 2005, such waived fees amounted to
     $199,222, $607,383, and $162,079 for California, Intermediate, and New
     York, respectively.

     Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.30% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the
     New York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to each Fund, are wholly-owned
     subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly-owned holding
     company. Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with investment
     recommendations and research information without added cost to each Fund.
     Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of each Fund are also
     employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

     Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
     custodian contract. For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the impact of
     this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $514, $531, and $536 for
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than

                                       32
<PAGE>

     one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of 1/4 of 1%; for any
     auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the service fee is
     paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the broker-dealer.

     Each Fund has paid Merrill Lynch a fee equal to 1/8 of 1% in connection
     with entering the special rate periods in return for which Merrill Lynch
     had agreed to pay dividends on the AMPS that, as a result of the auction,
     exceed a specified rate.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, each Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that each
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. Each Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under each Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may
     be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For each Fund, total
     return would have been lower if Management had not waived the investment
     management fee. Performance data current to the most recent month-end are

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.
