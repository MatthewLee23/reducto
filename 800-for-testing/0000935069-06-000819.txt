ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2005

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com/funds.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2005.

WHO ARE WE?

The Gabelli  Utility  Trust (the  "Trust") is a  closed-end  investment  company
registered  with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  under the Investment

variety of clients.

GABELLI CUSTOMER?

      name,  address,  telephone  number,  social security number,  bank account
      number, and other information.

      information  about the shares  that you buy or sell,  it may also  include
      information  about whether you sell or exercise rights that we have issued
      from time to time.  If we hire  someone else to provide  services--like  a
      transfer  agent--we will also have information about the transactions that
      you conduct through them.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE DISCLOSE AND TO WHOM DO WE DISCLOSE IT?

We do not disclose any non-public  personal  information  about our customers or
former customers to anyone, other than our affiliates, our service providers who
need to know such information, and as otherwise permitted by law. If you want to

who need to know that  information  in order to provide  services  to you or the
Trust and to ensure that we are complying with the laws governing the securities
business.  We maintain physical,  electronic,  and procedural safeguards to keep
your personal information confidential.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The Gabelli Utility Trust (the "Trust") is a  non-diversified
closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware statutory trust
on February 25, 1999 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), whose primary objective is long-term growth of capital
and income.  The Trust had no operations  prior to July 9, 1999,  other than the
sale of 10,000 shares of beneficial  interest for $100,000 to The Gabelli Equity
Trust Inc. (the "Equity  Trust") at $10.00 per share. On July 9, 1999, the Trust
had a 4 for 3 stock split  making the balance of Trust shares held by the Equity
Trust as 13,333.  On July 9, 1999, the Equity Trust  contributed  $79,487,260 in
cash and  securities  in exchange for shares of the Trust,  and on the same date
distributed  such shares to Equity Trust  shareholders of record on July 1, 1999
at the rate of one share of the Trust for every ten shares of the Equity  Trust.
Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

      The Trust will invest 80% of its assets,  under normal market  conditions,
in common stocks and other securities of foreign and domestic companies involved
in  providing  products,  services,  or  equipment  for  (i) the  generation  or
distribution of electricity, gas, and water and (ii) telecommunications services
or infrastructure  operations (the "80% Policy").  The 80% Policy may be changed
without shareholder approval. However, the Trust has adopted a policy to provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall determine in good

faith,  to reflect its fair market value.  Portfolio  securities  traded on more
than one  national  securities  exchange or market are valued  according  to the
broadest and most  representative  market,  as determined by Gabelli Funds,  LLC
(the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close of the foreign  markets,  but prior to the close
of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change
significantly,  certain  foreign  securities  may be  fair  valued  pursuant  to
procedures  established by the Board. Debt instruments with remaining maturities
of 60 days or less that are not credit  impaired are valued at  amortized  cost,
unless the Board determines such does not reflect the securities' fair value, in
which case these  securities will be valued at their fair value as determined by
the Board.  Debt  instruments  having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which
market  quotations are readily available are valued at the average of the latest
bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on such day,  the
security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at
the  closing  settlement  price of the  exchange  or board of trade on which the
applicable contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board. Fair
valuation  methodologies  and  procedures  may include,  but are not limited to:
analysis and review of available  financial and non-financial  information about
the company;  comparisons  to the  valuation and changes in valuation of similar
securities,  including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S.
dollar value ADR securities at the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of
any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical repurchase  agreement,  the Trust takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Trust to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Trust's holding period.
The Trust will always receive and maintain securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount invested by the Trust in each agreement.  The Trust will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization  of the  collateral  by the  Trust may be  delayed  or  limited.  At
December 31, 2005, there were $23,230,000 of open repurchase agreements.

      SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Trust  may enter  into  interest  rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Trust would agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap
(which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate  payment in
exchange  for the  counterparty  agreeing  to pay to the  Trust  periodically  a
variable rate payment that is intended to approximate the Trust's  variable rate
payment obligation on the Series B Preferred Stock. In an interest rate cap, the
Trust  would  pay a  premium  to the  counterparty  and,  to the  extent  that a
specified variable rate index exceeds a predetermined  fixed rate, would receive
from the counterparty payments of the difference based on the notional amount of
such cap.  Interest rate swap and cap  transactions  introduce  additional  risk
because the Trust would remain  obligated to pay preferred  stock dividends when
due in  accordance  with the  Articles  Supplementary  even if the  counterparty
defaulted.  If there is a default by the  counterparty  to a swap contract,  the
Trust will be limited to contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related
to the transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract  counterparties
will be able to meet their  obligations  pursuant to the swap contracts or that,
in the  event of  default,  the  Trust  will  succeed  in  pursuing  contractual
remedies. The Trust thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented
from  obtaining  payments  owed  to it  pursuant  to  the  swap  contracts.  The
creditworthiness  of the swap contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in
order to  minimize  this risk.  Depending  on the  general  state of  short-term
interest rates and the returns on the Trust's portfolio securities at that point
in time,  such a default  could  negatively  affect the Trust's  ability to make
dividend payments for the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition,  at the time an
interest rate swap or cap transaction  reaches its scheduled  termination  date,
there  is a risk  that  the  Trust  will  not be able to  obtain  a  replacement
transaction or that the terms of the replacement  will not be as favorable as on
the expiring transaction. If this occurs, it could have a negative impact on the
Trust's ability to make dividend payments on the Series B Preferred Stock.

      The use of derivative  instruments involves, to varying degrees,  elements
of market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or

receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements. Swap agreements
involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements of market and  counterparty  risk,  and
exposure to loss in excess of the related amounts  reflected in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

      The Trust has entered into one interest rate swap  agreement with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement the Trust receives a variable rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at December 31, 2005 are as follows:

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Trust may  engage in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase. Such investments will only be
made if they are economically  appropriate to the reduction of risks involved in
the  management  of the  Trust's  investments.  Upon  entering  into  a  futures
contract,  the Trust is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Trust each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuation  of the
value of the  contract.  The daily  changes  in the  contract  are  included  in
unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on investments and futures contracts. The
Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged  investments.  These  contracts may involve market
risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss  reflected  in the  Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. In addition, there is the risk that the Trust may not be
able to enter  into a  closing  transaction  because  of an  illiquid  secondary
market. At December 31, 2005, there were no open futures contracts.

      FORWARD  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  CONTRACTS.  The  Trust may  engage in  forward
foreign  exchange  contracts for hedging a specific  transaction with respect to
either the currency in which the transaction is denominated or another  currency
as deemed  appropriate by the Adviser.  Forward foreign  exchange  contracts are
valued at the forward rate and are marked-to-market  daily. The change in market
value is included in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and
foreign currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Trust records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference  between the value of the contract
at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Trust's portfolio  securities,  but
it does  establish  a rate of  exchange  that  can be  achieved  in the  future.
Although  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  limit the risk of loss due to a
decline in the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain
that might result should the value of the currency increase. These contracts may
involve  market risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  In addition, the Trust could be exposed to
risks if the  counterparties  to the  contracts  are unable to meet the terms of
their  contracts.  At December  31,  2005,  there were no open  forward  foreign
exchange contracts.

      FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The books and  records  of the Trust are
maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies, investments, and
other assets and  liabilities  are translated  into U.S.  dollars at the current
exchange  rates.  Purchases  and sales of  investment  securities,  income,  and
expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective  dates
of such  transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from changes in
foreign  exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting
from changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Trust and the amounts actually received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      FOREIGN SECURITIES.  The Trust may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

      FOREIGN TAXES. The Trust may be subject to foreign taxes on income,  gains
on investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Trust will accrue such taxes and  recoveries as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Trust is informed of the dividend.

      CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS.  When cash  balances are  maintained in the custody
account, the Trust receives credits which are used to offset custodian fees. The
gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are included in custodian fees
in the Statement of Operations  with the  corresponding  expense offset shown as
"custodian fee credits".

      DIVIDENDS  AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common
shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and
capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with Federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from that determined under U.S. generally accepted
accounting  principles.   These  differences  are  primarily  due  to  differing
treatments  of income and gains on  various  investment  securities  held by the
Trust,  foreign  currency  transactions,   timing  differences,   and  differing
characterizations of distributions made by the Trust. These book/tax differences
are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are
permanent,  adjustments  are made to the  appropriate  capital  accounts  in the
period when the differences arise. These reclassifications have no impact on the
NAV of the Trust and the  calculation of net investment  income per share in the
Financial Highlights includes these adjustments. For the year ended December 31,
2005,  reclassifications were made to decrease net investment income by $54,526,
and to decrease  accumulated  distributions  in excess of net  realized  gain on
investments, swap contracts, and foreign currency transactions by $54,526.

      Distributions  to  Shareholders  of the Trust's 5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred   Stock  and  Series  B  Auction  Rate   Cumulative   Preferred  Stock
("Cumulative  Preferred Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined
as described in Note 5.

      The tax character of  distributions  paid during the years ended  December
31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 was as follows:

      PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  The Trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code").  It is the policy of the Trust to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

      As of December 31, 2005, the  components of accumulated  earnings/(losses)
on a tax basis were as follows:

          Net unrealized appreciation on investments ...........    $23,083,225

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Trust has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Trust will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of its average  weekly
net assets including the liquidation value of the preferred stock. In accordance
with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous  investment
program for the Trust's portfolio and

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

oversees the  administration of all aspects of the Trust's business and affairs.
The Adviser has agreed to reduce the  management fee on the  incremental  assets
attributable  to the Cumulative  Preferred  Stock if the total return of the net
asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Trust,  including  distributions
and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed the stated dividend rate
or  corresponding  swap rate of the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the fiscal
year.

      The Trust's total return on the NAV of the Common Shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the Common Shares
exceeds  the  stated  dividend  rate of each  particular  series  of  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock for the  period.  For the year ended  December  31,  2005,  the
Trust's  total  return  on the NAV of the  Common  Shares  exceeded  the  stated
dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of all outstanding  Preferred  Stock.
Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

      During the year ended December 31, 2005, Gabelli & Company, Inc. ("Gabelli
&  Company"),  an  affiliate  of the  Adviser,  received  $131,324 in  brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Trust.

      In  connection  with the  2004  Rights  Offering  ("Rights"),  holders  of
unexercised  rights to purchase Common Shares of the Trust were able to instruct
the  Subscription  Agent  (EquiServe Trust Company) to sell such Rights on their
behalf.  The  Subscription  Agent was  permitted  to effect  such sales  through
Gabelli & Company,  unless the Subscription  Agent was able to negotiate a lower
commission  rate with an independent  broker.  Total  commissions  from sales of
Rights effected by the Subscription  Agent through Gabelli & Company amounted to
$21,882 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

      The cost of  calculating  the  Trust's  NAV per  share is a Trust  expense
pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the
Trust  reimbursed the Adviser  $45,000 in connection  with the cost of computing
the Trust's NAV, which is included in miscellaneous expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

      The Trust is  assuming  its portion of the  allocated  cost of the Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer  in the  amount of $5,820  for the year ended
December 31,  2005,  which is included in payroll  expenses in the  Statement of
Operations.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.  Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities,
other  than  short-term  securities,  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005
aggregated $108,027,441 and $40,478,829, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The Trust is  authorized to issue an unlimited  number of shares of
beneficial interest (par value $0.001).  The Board has authorized the repurchase
of its shares on the open  market  when the shares are  trading at a discount of
10% or more (or such other  percentage as the Board may  determine  from time to
time) from the NAV of the shares.  During the year ended  December 31, 2005, the
Trust did not repurchase any shares of beneficial interest in the open market.

Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

      The Trust is  authorized  to issue up to  2,005,000  shares of $0.001  par
value Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. The Cumulative  Preferred Stock is senior to
the Common Shares and results in the financial  leveraging of the Common Shares.
Such  leveraging  tends to magnify  both the risks and  opportunities  to common
shareholders.  Dividends  on  shares  of  the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  are
cumulative.  The  Trust  is  required  by the  1940  Act  and  by  the  Articles
Supplementary  to  meet  certain  asset  coverage  tests  with  respect  to  the
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. If the Trust fails to meet these  requirements and
does not correct such failure,  the Trust may be required to redeem,  in part or
in full,  the 5.625%  Series A and Series B Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock at a redemption price of $25.00 and $25,000,  respectively, per share plus
an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid dividends  whether or not declared
on such  shares in order to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to
meet the  foregoing  asset  coverage  requirements  could  restrict  the Trust's
ability  to pay  dividends  to common  shareholders  and could  lead to sales of
portfolio  securities at inopportune  times.  The income received on the Trust's
assets may vary in a manner  unrelated  to the fixed and variable  rates,  which
could have either a beneficial or detrimental  impact on net  investment  income
and gains available to common shareholders.

      On October 20, 2004, the Trust distributed one transferable right for each
of the 23,118,091  Common Shares  outstanding to  shareholders of record on that
date.  Four rights were required to purchase one additional  common share at the
subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders  who exercised  their full
primary  subscription  rights were eligible for an  over-subscription  privilege
entitling  them to  subscribe,  subject  to certain  limitations  and a pro-rata
allotment, for any additional shares not purchased pursuant

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

to the primary  subscription  plus such additional  amounts as authorized by the
Board in accordance with the registration  statement.  The  subscription  period
expired on November 24, 2004. The rights offering was fully  subscribed,  having
received  over-subscription  requests  in excess  of the  shares  available  for
primary  subscription  resulting in the issuance of 5,779,546  Common Shares and
proceeds  of  $40,456,822  to the Trust,  prior to the  deduction  of  estimated
expenses of  $475,000.  The NAV per share of the Trust common  shareholders  was
reduced by  approximately  $0.06 per share as a result of the issuance of shares
below NAV.

      On July 31, 2003, the Trust  received net proceeds of  $28,877,500  (after
underwriting  discounts of $945,000 and offering  expenses of $159,974) from the
public  offering of 1,200,000  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Commencing July 31, 2008 and thereafter,  the Trust, at its option,  may
redeem the 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption price at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Trust
did not repurchase any shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock. All
repurchased  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  have been
retired.  At  December  31,  2005,  1,184,200  shares  of the  5.625%  Series  A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$23,129.

      On July 31, 2003, the Trust  received net proceeds of  $24,572,500  (after
underwriting  discounts of $250,000 and offering  expenses of $159,974) from the
public  offering of 1,000 shares of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every 7 days, is expected to vary with short-term  interest rates.  The dividend
rates of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from 2.24% to
4.38% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Existing  shareholders may submit an
order to hold,  bid, or sell such shares on each auction date.  Series B Auction
Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  shareholders  may also  trade  shares in the
secondary market. The Trust, at its option, may redeem the Series B Auction Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in whole or in part at the redemption  price at any
time.  During the year ended  December  31,  2005,  the Trust did not redeem any
shares of Series B Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  At December 31,
2005, 1,000 shares of the Series B Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock were
outstanding  with an  annualized  dividend  rate of 4.38% per share and  accrued
dividends amounted to $12,167.

      The holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Trust and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class. The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Directors and under certain  circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Directors.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Trust's outstanding voting stock must approve the conversion of the Trust from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the 1940  Act) of the  Trust's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Trust's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6. INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION.  Because the Trust primarily invests in common stocks
and other securities of foreign and domestic  companies in the utility industry,
its  portfolio  may be subject to greater  risk and market  fluctuations  than a
portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Trust's  maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is
unknown. However, the Trust has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney  General  of the  State  of New York and the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  ("SEC")  requesting  information  on mutual fund  trading  practices
involving  certain  funds managed by the Adviser.  GAMCO  Investors,  Inc.,  the
Adviser's  parent  company,  is responding  to these  requests for documents and
testimony.  On a separate matter, in September 2005, the Adviser was informed by
the staff of the SEC that the  staff may  recommend  to the  Commission  that an
administrative  remedy and a  monetary  penalty  be sought  from the  Adviser in
connection  with the  actions of two of seven  closed-end  funds  managed by the
Adviser  relating  to  Section  19(a)  and Rule  19a-1 of the  1940  Act.  These
provisions require registered investment companies to provide written statements
to shareholders  when a dividend is made from a source other than net investment
income. While the two closed-end funds sent annual statements and provided other
materials containing this information, the funds did not send written statements
to shareholders  with each  distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser  believes
that all of the funds are now in  compliance.  The Adviser  believes  that these
matters would have no effect on the Trust or any material  adverse effect on the
Adviser or its ability to manage the Trust.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Utility Trust:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,   the  financial  position  of  The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust
(hereafter  referred to as the "Trust") at December 31, 2005, the results of its
operations  for the year then  ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial  highlights for each of
the periods  presented,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the  United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and
financial highlights  (hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the
responsibility of the Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  financial  statements in  accordance  with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2005 by  correspondence  with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

      Auction rate preferred  shares pay dividends weekly based on a rate set at
auction,  usually held every seven days.  The  percentage of 2005  distributions
derived from long-term capital gains was 75.62%.

      A Form  1099-DIV  has been  mailed to all  shareholders  of record for the
distributions  mentioned above, setting forth specific amounts to be included in
the 2005 tax  returns.  Ordinary  income  distributions  include net  investment
income and realized net short-term capital gains. Ordinary income is reported in
box 1a of Form 1099-DIV.  Capital gain  distributions  are reported in box 2a of
Form 1099-DIV.

CORPORATE  DIVIDENDS  RECEIVED  DEDUCTION,  QUALIFIED  DIVIDEND  INCOME AND U.S.
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INCOME

      The Trust  paid to  common  and  5.625%  Series A  preferred  shareholders
ordinary income dividends of $0.17520 and $0.34280 per share,  respectively,  in
2005. The Trust paid to Series B Auction Rate preferred shareholders an ordinary
income  dividend  totaling  $204.73 per share in 2005. For the fiscal year ended
December  31, 2005,  100% of the  ordinary  income  dividend  qualified  for the
dividend received deduction available to corporations,  and 100% of the ordinary
income  distribution was deemed qualified dividend income. The percentage of the
ordinary  income  dividends  paid by the Trust  during  2005  derived  from U.S.
Government  Securities was 8.57%. Such income is exempt from state and local tax
in all states. However, many states, including New York and California,  allow a
tax  exemption  for a portion of the  income  earned  only if a mutual  fund has
invested  at least 50% of its assets at the end of each  quarter of the  Trust's
fiscal year in U.S.  Government  Securities.  The Trust did not meet this strict
requirement  in 2005. The percentage of U.S.  Government  Securities  held as of
December 31, 2005 was 0.00%.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It is the policy of The Gabelli Utility Trust  ("Trust") to  automatically
reinvest dividends payable to common shareholders. As a "registered" shareholder
you  automatically  become  a  participant  in the  Trust's  Automatic  Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan  authorizes the Trust to issue common
shares to participants  upon an income dividend or a capital gains  distribution
regardless  of whether  the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to net
asset value. All  distributions  to shareholders  whose shares are registered in
their  own  names  will be  automatically  reinvested  pursuant  to the  Plan in
additional  shares  of  the  Trust.  Plan  participants  may  send  their  share
certificates to Computershare Trust Company,  N.A.  ("Computershare") to be held
in their  dividend  reinvestment  account.  Registered  shareholders  wishing to
receive their distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                            The Gabelli Utility Trust
                                c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

      If your shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  reregistered  in your own name.
Once  registered  in your  own name  your  distributions  will be  automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of common shares  distributed  to  participants  in the Plan in
lieu of cash  dividends is determined in the following  manner.  Under the Plan,
whenever  the market price of the Trust's  common  shares is equal to or exceeds
net asset value at the time shares are valued for  purposes of  determining  the
number  of  shares   equivalent   to  the  cash   dividends  or  capital   gains
distributions,  participants  are issued  common shares valued at the greater of
(i) the net  asset  value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of the then
current  market price of the Trust's  common  shares.  The valuation date is the
dividend or  distribution  payment date or, if that date is not a New York Stock
Exchange  ("NYSE")  trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of
the common  shares at the time of  valuation  exceeds  the  market  price of the
common shares,  participants will receive common shares from the Trust valued at
market  price.  If  the  Trust  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution  payable only in cash,  Computershare will buy common shares in the
open market, or on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts, except
that Computershare  will endeavor to terminate  purchases in the open market and
cause  the  Trust  to  issue  shares  at  net  asset  value  if,  following  the
commencement  of such  purchases,  the market value of the common shares exceeds
the then current net asset value.

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders to increase their  investment in the Trust. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to Computershare  for investments in the Trust's common
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  Computershare  will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market  on or about  the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will
charge each  shareholder who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage  commissions.  Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any  voluntary  cash  payments  be  sent  to  Computershare,   P.O.  Box  43010,
Providence,  RI  02940-3010  such  that  Computershare  receives  such  payments
approximately  10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month.  Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase  date. A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is
received  by  Computershare  at least  48 hours  before  such  payment  is to be
invested.

      SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Trust.

          described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

          Pre-Approval   Policies   and   Procedures.    The   Audit   Committee
          ("Committee") of the registrant is responsible for  pre-approving  (i)
          all audit and  permissible  non-audit  services  to be provided by the
          independent  auditors  to the  registrant  and  (ii)  all  permissible
          non-audit  services to be provided by the independent  auditors to the
          Adviser,  Gabelli Funds,  LLC, and any affiliate of Gabelli Funds, LLC
          ("Gabelli")  that  provides  services  to the  registrant  (a "Covered
          Services  Provider") if the independent  auditors'  engagement related
          directly to the operations and financial  reporting of the registrant.
          The Committee may delegate its  responsibility to pre-approve any such
          audit and  permissible  non-audit  services to the  Chairperson of the
          Committee,  and the Chairperson  must report to the Committee,  at its
          next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairperson's  pre-approval
          of such  services,  his or her  decision(s).  The  Committee  may also
          establish   detailed   pre-approval   policies  and   procedures   for
          pre-approval  of such services in  accordance  with  applicable  laws,
          including  the   delegation   of  some  or  all  of  the   Committee's
          pre-approval responsibilities to the other persons (other than Gabelli
          or the  registrant's  officers).  Pre-approval by the Committee of any
          permissible  non-audit  services  is not  required so long as: (i) the
          aggregate amount of all such permissible  non-audit  services provided
          to  the  registrant,   Gabelli  and  any  Covered  Services   Provider
          constitutes  not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues  paid by
          the registrant to its  independent  auditors during the fiscal year in
          which  the  permissible  non-audit  services  are  provided;  (ii) the
          permissible  non-audit  services were not recognized by the registrant
          at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such
          services are promptly  brought to the  attention of the  Committee and
          approved by the Committee or  Chairperson  prior to the  completion of
          the audit.

  (e)(2)  The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through

                           (b) 100%

                           (c) 100%
<PAGE>

                           (d) N/A



     (f)  The  percentage  of  hours  expended  on  the  principal  accountant's
          engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
          recent fiscal year that were  attributed to work  performed by persons
          other than the principal accountant's  full-time,  permanent employees
          was zero percent (0%).

     (g)  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
          services rendered to the registrant,  and rendered to the registrant's
          investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role is
          primarily  portfolio  management and is subcontracted with or overseen
          by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
          by, or under common  control with the adviser  that  provides  ongoing
          services to the  registrant  for each of the last two fiscal  years of
          the registrant was $0 in 2005 and $0 in 2004.

     (h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  of the  board  of  directors  has
          considered  whether the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
          rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including any
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
          entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common control with the
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
          2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
          accountant's independence.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

<PAGE>


                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

     Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule
30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require  investment  advisers to
adopt written policies and procedures  governing the voting of proxies on behalf
of their clients.

     These  procedures  will be used by GAMCO  Asset  Management  Inc.,  Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities,  Inc., and Gabelli Advisers, Inc. (collectively,
the  "Advisers")  to  determine  how  to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict  between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the  Advisers;  the  principal  underwriter;  or any  affiliated  person  of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the  Advisers do not have  voting  discretion  or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific  guidelines  or  procedures  supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).

I.   PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

The Proxy Voting  Committee was originally  formed in April 1989 for the purpose
of formulating  guidelines and reviewing proxy statements  within the parameters
set by the substantive  proxy voting  guidelines  originally  published by GAMCO
Investors,  Inc. in 1988 and updated periodically,  a copy of which are appended
as  Exhibit  A.  The  Committee  will  include   representatives   of  Research,
Administration,  Legal, and the Advisers.  Additional or replacement  members of
the  Committee  will be  nominated  by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire
Committee.

     Meetings  are held as needed basis to form views on the manner in which the
Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

     In  general,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using  the  Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

     All matters  identified by the Chairman of the  Committee,  the Director of
Proxy Voting  Services or the Legal  Department  as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.
<PAGE>


     A.   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

                    The Advisers have implemented  these proxy voting procedures
          in order to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing their proxy
          voting decisions.  By following the Proxy  Guidelines,  as well as the
          recommendations of ISS, other third-party services and the analysts of
          Gabelli & Company, the Advisers are able to avoid,  wherever possible,
          the  influence  of  potential  conflicts  of  interest.  Nevertheless,
          circumstances may arise in which one or more of the Advisers are faced
          with a  conflict  of  interest  or the  appearance  of a  conflict  of
          interest  in  connection  with its vote.  In  general,  a conflict  of
          interest may arise when an Adviser  knowingly  does  business  with an
          issuer,  and may appear to have a material  conflict  between  its own
          interests  and the  interests  of the  shareholders  of an  investment
          company  managed by one of the Advisers  regarding how the proxy is to
          be  voted.  A  conflict  also may exist  when an  Adviser  has  actual
          knowledge of a material business  arrangement between an issuer and an
          affiliate of the Adviser.

          In practical  terms,  a conflict of interest  may arise,  for example,
          when a proxy is voted  for a  company  that is a client  of one of the
          Advisers,  such as GAMCO  Asset  Management  Inc. A conflict  also may
          arise  when a client  of one of the  Advisers  has made a  shareholder
          proposal  in a proxy to be voted upon by one or more of the  Advisers.
          The  Director  of Proxy  Voting  Services,  together  with  the  Legal
          Department,  will scrutinize all proxies for these or other situations
          that may give rise to a  conflict  of  interest  with  respect  to the
          voting of proxies.

     A.   OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE.

          For matters  submitted to the Committee,  each member of the Committee
          will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the proxy statement, any
          relevant third party research,  a summary of any views provided by the
          Chief Investment Officer and any recommendations by Gabelli & Company,
          Inc. analysts.  The Chief Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company,
          Inc.  analysts  may be  invited to present  their  viewpoints.  IF THE
          DIRECTOR OF PROXY VOTING SERVICES or the Legal Department believe that
          the  matter  before  the  committee  is one  with  respect  to which a
          conflict of interest may exist between the Advisers and their clients,
          counsel  will  provide  an  opinion to the  Committee  concerning  the
          conflict.  If the matter is one in which the  interests of the clients
          of one or more of Advisers may diverge, counsel will so advise and the
          Committee may make different  recommendations as to different clients.
          For any matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
          counsel will provide an opinion concerning the likely risks and merits
          of such an appraisal action.

     Each matter  submitted to the Committee will be determined by the vote of a
majority of the members  present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning one
or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of the
Committee  will cast the  deciding  vote.  The  Committee  will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.
<PAGE>

     Although the Proxy Guidelines express the normal preferences for the voting
of any shares not  covered by a contrary  investment  guideline  provided by the
client,  the  Committee is not bound by the  preferences  set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.

     If the vote cast either by the analyst or as a result of the  deliberations
of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation  of the Board
of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter  will be referred to legal  counsel to
determine  whether an  amendment  to the most  recently  filed  Schedule  13D is
appropriate.

II.  SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

     If a client has  provided  special  instructions  relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III. CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

     If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is any
change in voting  authority,  the following should be notified by the investment
professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

     In the event that the Board of Directors (or a Committee thereof) of one or
more of the  investment  companies  managed by one of the  Advisers has retained
direct  voting  control  over any  security,  the Proxy Voting  Department  will
provide  each  Board  Member  (or  Committee  member)  with a copy of the  proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.  VOTING RECORDS

     The Proxy Voting  Department  will retain a record of matters voted upon by
the Advisers for their  clients.  The Advisers'  staff may request  proxy-voting
records for use in presentations to current or prospective clients. Requests for
proxy voting records should be made at least ten days prior to client meetings.

     If a client  wishes  to  receive  a proxy  voting  record  on a  quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual  basis,  please notify the Proxy Voting  Department.  The
reports will be available for mailing  approximately  ten days after the quarter
end of the period.  First  quarter  reports may be delayed  since the end of the
quarter falls during the height of the proxy season.
<PAGE>

     A letter is sent to the  custodians  for all clients for which the Advisers
have voting responsibility instructing them to forward all proxy materials to:

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.   VOTING PROCEDURES

1.  Custodian  banks,  outside  brokerage  firms and Wexford  Clearing  Services
Corporation are responsible for forwarding proxies directly to GAMCO.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms (VAFs) - Issued by ADP. VAFs must be
     voted through the issuing institution causing a time lag. ADP is an outside
     service contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.
o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

 3. In the case of a  discrepancy  such as an  incorrect  number of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions  from the proxy committee (see  Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Since  January 1, 1992,  records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.
The  system  is backed  up  regularly.  From 1990  through  1991,  records  were
maintained  on the PROXY  VOTER  system and in hardcopy  format.  Prior to 1990,
records were maintained on diskette and in hardcopy format.

PROXY EDGE records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors'  Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue
         The rationale for the vote when it appropriate
<PAGE>

Records  prior to the  institution  of the PROXY EDGE system  include:
         Security name
         Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Date of Meeting Name of Custodian
         Name of Client
         Custodian  Account  Number
         Adviser  or Fund Account Number
         Directors'  recommendation
         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue
         Date the proxy  statement was received and by whom
         Name of person  posting  the vote
         Date and method by which the vote was cast

o    From these records individual client proxy voting records are compiled.  It
     is our policy to provide  institutional  clients with a proxy voting record
     during client reviews. In addition, we will supply a proxy voting record at
     the request of the client on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by ADP are always sent directly
to a specific individual at ADP.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to ADP up until the time of the meeting. This is followed
     up by mailing the original form.

o    When a  solicitor  has been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o    Banks and brokerage firms using the services at ADP:

     The back of the VAF is stamped  indicating  that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent  overnight to ADP. ADP issues  individual  legal proxies
and sends them back via overnight (or the Adviser can pay messenger charges).  A
lead-time  of at least  two  weeks  prior to the  meeting  is needed to do this.
Alternatively,  the  procedures  detailed  below  for banks not using ADP may be
implemented.
<PAGE>

o    Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

     The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A  limited   Power  of  Attorney   appointing   the   attendee  an  Adviser
     representative.
o    A list of all  shares  being  voted by  custodian  only.  Client  names and
     account numbers are not included.  This list must be presented,  along with
     the  proxies,  to the  Inspectors  of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least
     one-half  hour prior to the scheduled  start of the meeting.  The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e.  determine if the vote have  previously been
     cast,  if the votes have been  rescinded,  etc. vote have  previously  been
     cast, etc.).
o    A sample ERISA and Individual contract.
o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.
o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

                          ===========================

                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

                          ===========================

<PAGE>

                            GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our  clients.  As we  state  in  our  Magna  Carta  of  Shareholders  Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither for nor against  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Historical responsiveness to shareholders
     This may include such areas as:
         -Paying greenmail
         -Failure  to   adopt  shareholder resolutions  receiving  a majority of
          shareholder votes
o    Qualifications
o    Nominating committee in place
o    Number of outside directors on the board
o    Attendance at meetings
o    Overall performance

                              SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for audit

                           BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.

                                CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.
<PAGE>

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place we will generally not support  attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.

                        INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Future use of additional shares
         -Stock split
         -Stock option or other executive  compensation  plan
         -Finance growth of company/strengthen  balance sheet
         -Aid in restructuring
         -Improve credit rating
         -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o    Amount of stock currently authorized  but not yet issued  or  reserved  for
     stock option plans
o    Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.

                               CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.
<PAGE>

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.

                     DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.

                            EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.

                              FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                                GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by- case basis.

Note:  Congress has imposed a tax on any parachute that is more than three times
the executive's average annual compensation.

                            ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.
<PAGE>

                CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                   MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.

                                 MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.

                                NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

                       OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o    State of Incorporation
o    Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o    Other mitigating factors

<PAGE>

                                   POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.

                                 REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.

                               STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o    Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o    Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o    Method of payment
o    Amount of stock already authorized but not yet issued under existing stock
     option plans

                         SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
- -------------------------------


As  reflected  above,  Mr.  Gabelli  manages  accounts in addition to the Trust.
Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio Manager also
has  day-to-day  management  responsibilities  with respect to one or more other
accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION  OF LIMITED TIME AND  ATTENTION.  As  indicated  above,  Mr.  Gabelli
manages multiple accounts. As a result, he will not be able to devote all of his
time to  management of the Trust.  Mr.  Gabelli,  therefore,  may not be able to
formulate  as  complete a strategy  or identify  equally  attractive  investment
opportunities  for  each of  those  accounts  as might be the case if he were to
devote all of his attention to the management of only the Trust.

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  As indicated above, Mr. Gabelli
manages  managed  accounts with investment  strategies  and/or policies that are
similar  to the  Trust.  In these  cases,  if the he  identifies  an  investment
opportunity that may be suitable for multiple  accounts,  a Fund may not be able
to take full  advantage  of that  opportunity  because  the  opportunity  may be
allocated  among  all or  many of  these  accounts  or  other  accounts  managed
primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser,  and their affiliates.  In
addition,  in the event Mr.  Gabelli  determines to purchase a security for more
than one account in an aggregate  amount that may  influence the market price of
the security,  accounts that  purchased or sold the security first may receive a
more favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions.

SELECTION  OF  BROKER/DEALERS.  Because  of  Mr.  Gabelli's  position  with  the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor,  he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute  portfolio  transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING  STRATEGIES.  At times,  Mr.  Gabelli may determine that an
investment  opportunity  may be  appropriate  for only some of the  accounts for
which he exercises investment responsibility,  or may decide that certain of the
funds or accounts  should take differing  positions with respect to a particular
security.  In these cases, he may execute differing or opposite transactions for
one or more  accounts  which may affect the market  price of the security or the
execution of the  transaction,  or both,  to the  detriment of one or more other
accounts.
<PAGE>

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION.  A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other  benefits  available to Mr.  Gabelli  differ among the accounts that he
manages.  If the  structure of the  Adviser's  management  fee or the  Portfolio
Manager's  compensation  differs among accounts (such as where certain  accounts
pay higher management fees or performance-based  management fees), the Portfolio
Manager may be motivated to favor certain  accounts  over others.  The Portfolio
Manager also may be motivated  to favor  accounts in which he has an  investment
interest,  or  in  which  the  Adviser,  or  their  affiliates  have  investment
interests.  Similarly,  the desire to maintain  assets  under  management  or to
enhance a Portfolio  Manager's  performance  record or to derive other  rewards,
financial or  otherwise,  could  influence  the  Portfolio  Manager in affording
preferential  treatment to those accounts that could most significantly  benefit
the Portfolio Manager.  For example,  as reflected above, if Mr. Gabelli manages
accounts  which have  performance  fee  arrangements,  certain  portions  of his
compensation  will depend on the achievement of performance  milestones on those
accounts.  Mr.  Gabelli  could be incented to afford  preferential  treatment to
those accounts and thereby by subject to a potential conflict of interest.

The Adviser,  and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser  and their  staff  members.  However,  there is no  guarantee  that such
policies and  procedures  will be able to detect and prevent every  situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR MARIO J. GABELLI
- -------------------------------------------

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined  by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees the  firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's  compensation)  allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have  arrangements  whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee  attributable  to the  liquidation  value of outstanding  preferred
stock (and Mr.  Gabelli would only receive his  percentage of such advisory fee)
if  certain  performance  levels  are met.  Additionally,  he  receives  similar
incentive  based variable  compensation  for managing other accounts  within the
firm and its  affiliates.  This method of  compensation  is based on the premise
that superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher  compensation  as a result of growth of assets through  appreciation
and net investment  activity.  The level of  compensation is not determined with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  One of the other  registered  investment  companies  managed  by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance  (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his  compensation
is  adjusted  up or down  based on the  performance  of the  investment  company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance  fees.
Compensation  for managing these accounts has two  components.  One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account.  The second component is based on absolute  performance of the account,
with  respect  to  which a  percentage  of such  performance  fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli.  As an executive  officer of the  Adviser's  parent  company,  GBL, Mr.
Gabelli  also  receives ten percent of the net  operating  profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES IN THE FUND
- -------------------------------

Mario Gabelli owned 590,738.82 shares of the Trust as of December 31, 2005.

                  GABELLI ASSET MANAGEMENT INC. AND AFFILIATES


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE GABELLI FUNDS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each  investment  company  listed on Exhibit 1 hereto  (each a
"COMPANY") is committed to conducting  business in  accordance  with  applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate  disclosure -- financial  and otherwise -- in compliance  with
applicable  law.  This  Code  of  Ethics,  applicable  to each  Company's  Chief
Executive Officer,  President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (together, "SENIOR OFFICERS"), sets forth policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

                  As a Senior Officer,  you must comply with applicable law. You
also have a responsibility  to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner.
You have  leadership  responsibilities  that include  creating a culture of high
ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that  encourages  the  internal  reporting of  compliance  concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics  recognizes  that the Senior  Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies,  because the Senior Officers  currently or may in the future serve as
Senior  Officers  of each of the  Companies,  as officers  or  employees  of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "Advisor")
and/or  affiliates  of the  Advisor  (the  "Advisory  Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors  of other  registered  investment  companies and unregistered
investment  funds  advised  by the  Advisory  Group.  This Code of  Ethics  also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and  procedures  adopted by, the  Companies  or the  Advisory  Group govern your
conduct in  connection  with many of the  conflict of interest  situations  that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

          o       the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulation   promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 ACT");

          o       the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "ADVISERS ACT");

          o       the Code of Ethics  adopted by each  Company  pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act  (collectively,  the "TRUST'S 1940
                  ACT CODE OF ETHICS");
<PAGE>

          o       one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been  reviewed and  approved by those  trustees/directors
                  (the  "DIRECTORS")  of each Company  that are not  "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the  "ADVISORY  GROUP'S  1940 ACT
                  CODE OF ETHICS" and,  together  with such  Company's  1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 ACT CODES OF ETHICS");

          o       the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3,   Rule  17a-7  and  Rule  17e-1   under  the  1940  Act
                  (collectively, the "CONFLICT POLICIES"); and

          o       the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other  things,  conflict  of interest  situations  and related
                  matters (collectively, the "ADVISORY POLICIES").

The  provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the  Conflict  Policies  and  the  Advisory  Policies  are  referred  to  herein
collectively as the "ADDITIONAL CONFLICT RULES".

                  This Code of Ethics is  different  from,  and is  intended  to
supplement,  the  Additional  Conflict  Rules.  Accordingly,  a violation of the
Additional  Conflict  Rules by a Senior  Officer  is hereby  deemed  not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional  Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior  Officer has a  responsibility  to each Company to
act with integrity.  Integrity  requires,  among other things,  being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

          o       act with  integrity,  including  being honest and candid while
                  still  maintaining the  confidentiality  of information  where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

          o       comply with the laws,  rules and  regulations  that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's  operations and report any suspected
                  violations  thereof  in  accordance  with  the  section  below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

          o       adhere to a high standard of business ethics.
<PAGE>
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest  for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs  when your  private  interests  interfere  in any way,  or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior  Officers  are expected to use  objective  and unbiased
standards when making  decisions that affect each Company,  keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain  inherent  conflicts of interest  because
Senior  Officers of a Company  also are or may be  officers  of other  Companies
and/or the Advisory  Group (as a result of which it is incumbent  upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner,  including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business  relationships.  When making
any  investment,  accepting  any  position  or  benefits,  participating  in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest  with respect to each Company  where
you are  receiving a personal  benefit,  you should act in  accordance  with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior  Officer  of a Company,  you should  make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and  circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the  Advisory  Group (the  "CCO") and obtain the  approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some  conflict of interest  situations  that should  always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

          o       the receipt of any  entertainment  or non-nominal  gift by the
                  Senior  Officer,  or a member of his or her  family,  from any
                  company  with  which a  Company  has  current  or  prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate  as to time and place,  and not so  frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

          o       any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

          o       a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other  than an  interest  arising  from the  Senior  Officer's
                  employment  by the Advisory  Group,  such as  compensation  or
                  equity ownership.
<PAGE>

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable  disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations  in all reports  and  documents  that such  Company  files with,  or
submits to, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  or a national  securities
exchange  and in all other  public  communications  made by such  Company.  As a
Senior Officer,  you are required to promote  compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company 's standards,  policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

          o       familiarize   himself   or   herself   with   the   disclosure
                  requirements  applicable  to  each  Company  as  well  as  the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

          o       not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent  auditors,  such Company's counsel,
                  any  counsel  to  the  Independent   Directors,   governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a  violation  of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations,  policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must  report  that  information  on a  timely  basis  to the  CCO or  report  it
anonymously by following the "whistle  blower"  policies adopted by the Advisory
Group from time to time. NO ONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION BECAUSE OF A GOOD
FAITH REPORT OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION.

                  Each Company will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

          o       the CCO will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
                  actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

          o       violations  and potential  violations  will be reported to the
                  Board  of  Directors  of  each  affected  Company  after  such
                  investigation;

          o       if the Board of  Directors  determines  that a  violation  has
                  occurred,  it  will  take  all  appropriate   disciplinary  or
                  preventive action; and

          o       appropriate  disciplinary  or preventive  action may include a
                  letter of censure,  suspension,  dismissal or, in the event of
                  criminal or other serious  violations of law,  notification of
                  the  Securities and Exchange  Commission or other  appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities.
<PAGE>

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

                  Except as otherwise  provided in this Code of Ethics,  the CCO
is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics to specific  situations in which
questions are presented to the CCO and has the authority to interpret  this Code
of Ethics in any particular  situation.  The CCO shall take all action he or she
considers appropriate to investigate any actual or potential violations reported
under this Code of Ethics.

                  The CCO is authorized  to consult,  as  appropriate,  with the
chair of the Governance  Committee and with counsel to the affected Company, the
Advisory Group or the Independent Directors, and is encouraged to do so.

                  The Board of Directors of the affected  Company is responsible
for granting waivers of this Code of Ethics,  as appropriate.  Any changes to or
waivers of this Code of Ethics  will,  to the extent  required,  be disclosed on
Form N-CSR,  or  otherwise,  as provided by Securities  and Exchange  Commission
rules.

less  than six (6) years  from the date an  action  is taken,  the first two (2)
years in an easily  accessible  place,  a copy of the  information  or materials
supplied to the Boards of Directors pursuant to this Code of Ethics:

          o       that  provided  the basis for any  amendment or waiver to this
                  Code of Ethics; and

          o       relating to any violation of this Code of Ethics and sanctions

                      SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT



I, Bruce N. Alpert, certify that:

1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The Gabelli Utility Trust;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets,  and cash flows (if the  financial  statements  are required to
         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) and
         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed
              under our supervision,  to provide reasonable  assurance regarding
              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and


<PAGE>




         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
              internal control over financial reporting.
