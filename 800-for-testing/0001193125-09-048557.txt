               FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular monthly, fixed cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.

   The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid
back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or
"income".

   The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) notices
of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting
purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting
purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder
of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The
Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will
tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.

   The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan at
any time, without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Dear Fellow ZTR Shareholder:

   I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for the
Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value declined 4.70% for the quarter
ended December 31, 2008, including $0.101 in reinvested distributions. During
the same period, the Fund's Composite Index fell 7.61%, including reinvested
dividends. The Fund's average exposure for the quarter was approximately 39% in
bonds and 36% in equities.

   For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund's net asset value was down
10.09% including $0.458 in reinvested distributions. During the same period the
Fund's Composite Index fell 15.01% including reinvested dividends. The Fund's
average exposure for the year was approximately 39% in equities and 35% in
bonds.

          Sincerely,

          /s/ George R. Aylward
          George R. Aylward
          President, Chairman and
          Chief Executive Officer
          The Zweig Total Return
          Fund, Inc.

                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

   Pounded by successive barrages of negative economic news, the stock markets
in 2008 suffered their worst year since the Great Depression. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average slumped 33.8%/(1)/, its biggest downturn since the
52.7%/(1)/ debacle in 1931. Doing no better, the S&P 500 was down 38.5%/(1)/,
matching its 38.6%/(1)/ decline in 1937. The record S&P 500 loss was 47.1%/(1)/
in 1931. The NASDAQ Composite, created in 1971, posted its biggest drop ever,
plummeting 40.5%/(1)/, topping its 39.3%/(1)/ tumble in 2000 after the
tech-stock bubble burst.

   There were no safe havens outside the U.S. The Dow Jones Stoxx index of
Europe's 600 largest companies sank 46%/(1)/ in 2008, the largest annual
decline in its 22-year history, lowering values to early 1997 levels. Britain's
FTSE 100 Index slid 31.3%/(1)/, a record drop since the index was formed in
1984. Germany's DAX stumbled 40.4%,/(1)/ Asia also was hit hard, with the MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index off 43%/(1)/. Japan's Nikkei stock average of 225 companies
fell 42.1%/(1)/ and China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index collapsed
65.4%/(1)/

   The weakness in the markets reflects the fact that the U.S. remains mired in
a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the government-sponsored
recession designator and scorekeeper, reported that our current recession began
in December 2007. Only two recessions have endured longer than the current
one --those ending in 1975 and 1983, each lasting eleven months. If this
recession persists through April, it would be the longest recession since the
43-month downturn that ended in 1933.

 asset value annually. Please see the inside front cover for more details.

   As the impact of the recession spread, the nation's unemployment rate jumped
from 6.8% in November to 7.2% in December, a 16-year high, according to the
Labor Department. More than 524,000 jobs were lost in December, bringing the
total for 2008 to 2.6 million. At 7.2%, the rate is the highest since 1993,
while last year's job loss was the greatest since 1945.

   In a move to stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve (the "Fed") cut its
benchmark interest rate to a historic low of zero to 0.25% at its December
meeting. In notes released after the meeting, the Fed foresaw a deep
contraction in the first half of 2009 and slow growth in the second half that
would not make up for the losses. Some officials expressed concern that the
reduction in stock and housing wealth, combined with the global economic
contraction, could lead to a longer and deeper recession than previously
predicted. As a result, the Fed's staff said the unemployment rate was likely
to rise significantly into 2010. After citing the numerous problems, the Fed
promised "to employ all available tools to promote the resumption of
sustainable economic growth and to provide price stability."

   The Fed and the Treasury have already done a great deal but there is little
evidence so far that the credit squeeze is loosening. Setting up the Troubled
Assets Relief Program and drawing on the $700 billion rescue package approved
by Congress, the government has already doled out hundreds of millions to the
financial and automotive industries. Furthermore, it is reported that the Obama
administration will seek an economic stimulus package of at least $825 billion,
including a $300 billion tax cut.

   While the monetary infusion is growing, the economy is moribund. The
broken-bubble housing market that ignited the financial implosion continues to
weaken. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell to 625,000
units in November, an 18.9% drop from October and 47% under the year-ago
figure. Meanwhile, the sales of previously owned homes tumbled 13% in November
from a year earlier, the sharpest decline in more than 40 years, according to
the National Association of Realtors.

   Similar reports are coming in from the manufacturing sector. The Institute
for Supply Management said that its index of manufacturing activity in December
sank to the lowest level in 28 years. With a number below 50 indicating
contraction, the December figure was 32.4, down from 36 in the previous month.
It was the lowest rating since 30.36 in June 1980.

   In another confirmation of the economy's deterioration, the Fed reported
that industrial production declined 0.6% in November. Capacity utilization
dipped to 75.4% in November from 76% in October. New orders for durable
goods --products expected to last at least three years --were also off in
November, slipping 1% to $186.9 billion, according to the Commerce Department.
New orders had fallen 8.4% in October. Earlier the Commerce Department reported
that the U.S. gross domestic product slid 0.5% in the third quarter, the
steepest drop since 2001.

   The U.S. trade deficit increased to $57.2 billion in October from $56.6
billion in September, according to the Commerce Department. October exports of
$151.7 billion were $3.4 billion below September's $155.1 billion. Imports of
$208.9 billion in October were $2.7 billion less than September's total of
$211.6 billion. The stronger dollar may have been a factor in the drop in
exports. In 2008 the dollar strengthened 4.5% against the Euro, 36% against the
British pound and 22% against the Canadian dollar. As the major exception, the
dollar slipped 16% against the Japanese yen.

   Largely as a result of the steep decline in gasoline and fuel oil costs,
consumer prices fell 1.7% in November, the deepest decline since the Labor
Department began keeping track in 1947. The core rate of inflation, excluding
volatile food and energy, was flat for the month. While this price stability
indicates that inflation is in check,


                                      3

<PAGE>


it brought concerns that deflation might be looming. There has not been a
serious period of deflation since the 1930s. However, we are very concerned
about the prospect. Based on the sharp declines in bond yields, it seems that
the market expects deflation or something very close to it.

   With the business news so bleak, there was little surprise when the
Conference Board reported that the overall consumer confidence in December fell
to its lowest level on record. Only 6.2% of Americans said that business
conditions were good and 6.2% said jobs were plentiful, down from 23.6% a year
ago.

   The softness in the economy has virtually shut down the market for initial
public offerings ("IPOs"). In the U.S., 33 companies went public in 2008,
raising $26.2 billion, according to Dealogic. This compares with 183 offerings
that raised $42.7 billion in 2007. Globally, the number of IPOs totaled 663,
raising $76.4 billion against 1,708 offerings that raised $272.1 billion in
2007. The global number of offerings was the lowest since Dealogic began
keeping score in 1995 and the money raised was the least since 2003. At this
writing, conditions for the IPOs are horrendous and there seems little
likelihood of a recovery soon.

   Mergers and acquisitions continued to suffer from tight credit conditions.
Not counting government-sponsored deals, domestic M&A activity in the fourth
quarter dropped 5.3% from a year earlier to $115 billion, the worst quarter in
six years, according to Dealogic. Spending $280 billion, the government
obtained 20 of the 25 largest deals. Globally the number of deals declined 24%
to 6,371, while volume dropped 38 % to $585 billion. For 2008, global volume
was down 24% to $3.06 trillion, about equal to the 2005 total. Looking to the
future, cash deals will be harder and leveraged buyouts will be virtually
non-existent. However, there will always be mergers and acquisitions. Some
companies will be so beaten down that they will be considered cheap enough to
be bought by another company.

   Demonstrating the severity of the recession, U.S. corporate profits are
estimated to have fallen again in the fourth quarter of 2008, marking the sixth
consecutive quarterly decline, according to Bloomberg News. That would make it
the longest quarterly slump since 1988. Earnings of companies in the S&P 500
probably dropped an average of 11.9% in the quarter from a year earlier
according to the agency. Analysts forecast that the downward streak would reach
eight quarters, with a 10.3% fall in the first quarter of 2009 and a 5.8% dip
in the second quarter.

   At the year-end, companies in the S&P 500 were trading at 18.8 times
earnings, with the ratio rising to 19.6 in the first week of 2009. This
compares with P/Es of 22.9 on September 30, 2008 and 19.0 at the end of 2007.
If you consider a very broad band of so-called fair value, we believe the
current numbers are in the upper range, but not necessarily overvalued. They
are not undervalued either, but if current conditions continue, P/E ratios may
become undervalued.

   Despite the market's weakness, a majority of analysts surveyed by Investors
Intelligence were optimistic. Early in 2009 there were 42% bulls and 34% bears
compared with 35% bulls and 38% bears at the year-end. Interestingly, members
of the American Institute of Individual Investors were more bearish than the
analysts. Individual investors were 29% bulls and 44% bears in early 2009
against 30% bulls and 50% bears at the end of 2008. These figures have been so
volatile lately that it is hard to put any stock in them.

   Right now our equity indicators look bullish but we don't trust them because
we have not seen an economy like this since the 1930s. If you change the entire
economic environment, as has happened, the traditional indicators don't work.
For example, lower interest rates are usually bullish. Now the rates have gone
down to zero and look where we are.

   Our exposure to U.S. common stocks was 38% on December 31, 2008, unchanged
from our position at the end of the third quarter. If we


                                      4

<PAGE>


were fully invested our portfolio would be 50% in equities and 50% in bonds.
Consequently, at 38%, we are at about 76% of a full position (38/50).

   The Fund's bond exposure at the year-end was 42%, with average duration, (a
measure of sensitivity to interest rates) of 3.1 years. With the close of the
third quarter, our bond exposure was 31%, with an average duration unchanged at
3.1 years at 42% in bonds, we are at about 84% of a full position (42/50).

   Amid all the headline-making economic news during 2008, relatively little
attention was paid to the remarkable performance of Treasury bonds. Yields on
the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell from 4.02% at the beginning of the
year to 2.21% at the end of December 2008. (Bond prices move in the opposite
direction from yields.) The only major asset class with positive performance
(other than cash) was Treasury bonds. As investors shunned risk, they sold
stocks of every description as well as corporate bonds. They also liquidated
holdings in commodities and real estate. The one safe haven was Treasury bonds.

   As mentioned earlier, The Fed cut its overnight federal funds rate from
4.25% at the start of the year to the unprecedented level of between 0 and
0.25%. As a result, the Fed, for all practical purposes, has a zero interest
rate policy for overnight inter-bank loans. This is similar to what occurred in
Japan in the mid to late nineties.

   Fueling the interest rate cuts and the flight to Treasuries was a massive
slowdown in the economy, a total collapse in commodities that eased inflation
concerns, and a meltdown of the worldwide banking system. The forced
liquidation of Bear Stearns, which many felt would mark the lows in yields,
turned out to have been just the beginning.

   The list of collapsed institutions is long but the most astounding included
AIG, Wachovia, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Lehman Brothers. As failure became
a truly scary but real possibility for a number of financial institutions, the
panic sent investors to the last perceived bastion of true credit safety: the
U.S. Government.

   While there is plenty of blame for the weakened state of many commercial and
investment banks, we believe a stellar role was played by a new derivative
contract known as a credit-default swap ("CDS"). Essentially an insurance
policy on the solvency of the bond issuer, it allowed a bond holder to hedge
against default. Soon speculators entered the market to play the credit spread.
Eventually, this market ballooned and burst, with even issuers of CDSs going
bankrupt. As the consequences of the collapse came to life in tandem with the
housing market free-fall, a plunging stock market and oil prices collapsing by
over $100 a barrel, holders of Treasury bonds were happy investors.

   In late Spring and early Fall as commodity prices were soaring, inflation
concerns were pervasive. However, only months later, by mid-Fall, the growing
fear of deflation further powered the Treasuries to their biggest monthly gains
since the early Reagan years.

   While we did make certain moves during the year, we never deviated from our
policy of not including any credit exposure from outside the U.S. Government in
our bond portfolio. Although we had a relatively modest duration for the
overall portfolio, the bonds we did own helped the performance of the fund
dramatically. In the late Fall we added some Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities (TIPS) as yields on this particular series surged. At present, we
see a great deal of medium to longer-term value in this area.


          Sincerely,

          /s/Martin E. Zweig, Ph.D.

   At December 31, 2008, all of our bonds are U.S. Government Agency
obligations. These bonds are highly liquid and provide the flexibility to
respond quickly to changing market conditions.

   The Fund's leading equity sectors on December 31, 2008 included financials,
consumer staples, industrials, information technology and health care. Aside
from allocation changes, all of the above appeared in our previous report.
During the quarter we added to our positions in health care and materials and
trimmed our holdings in financials and consumer discretionary.

   On December 31, 2008, our top individual positions included Allstate, Atria,
AT&T, FreeportMcMoRan, McDonald's, Merck, Nucor, Philip Morris International,
Verizon and Wilmington Trust. In this listing we added to our holdings in
Allstate, AT&T, FreeportMcMoRan, Nucor and Verizon.

   No longer among our top positions are ConocoPhillips, where we added to our
position; Nike, where there was no change in shares held, and the following
where we trimmed our holdings: Hudson City Bancorp, PepsiCo and Wells Fargo.

Deflation: A general decline in prices, if it persists, generally creates a
vicious spiral of negatives such as falling profits, closing factories,
shrinking employment and incomes, and increasing defaults on loans by companies
and individuals. To counter deflation, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) can use
monetary policy to increase the money supply and deliberately induce rising
prices, causing inflation.

Dow Jones Industrial Average/SM/: A price-weighted average of 30 blue chip
stocks. The index is calculated on a total return basis with dividends
reinvested.

Duration: A measure of a fixed income fund's sensitivity to interest rate
changes. For example, if a fund's duration is 5 years, a 1% increase in
interest rates would result in a 5% decline in the fund's price. Similarly, a
1% decline in interest rates would result in a 5% gain in the fund's price.

Federal funds rate: The interest rate charged on overnight loans of reserves by
one financial institution to another in the United States. The federal funds
rate is the most sensitive indicator of the direction of interest rates since
it is set daily by the market.

Federal Reserve: The central bank of the United States, responsible for
controlling the money supply, interest rates and credit with the goal of
keeping the U.S. economy and currency stable. Governed by a seven- member
board, the system includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, 25 branches and
all national and state banks that are part of the system.

Initial public offering (IPO): A company's first sale of stock to the public.

Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Report on Business(R): An economic
forecast, released monthly, that measures U.S. manufacturing conditions and is
arrived at by surveying 300 purchasing professionals in the manufacturing
sector representing 20 industries in all 50 states.

Investors Intelligence Survey: A weekly survey published by Chartcraft, an
investment services company, of the current sentiment of approximately 150
market newsletter writers. Participants are classified into three categories:
bullish, bearish or waiting for a correction.

NASDAQ Composite(R) Index: A market capitalization-weighted index of all issues
listed in the NASDAQ (National Association Of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System) Stock Market, except for closed-end funds, convertible
debentures, exchange traded funds, preferred stocks, rights, warrants, units
and other derivative securities. The index is calculated on a total return
basis with dividends reinvested.

S&P 500(R) Index: A free-float market capitalization-weighted index of 500 of
the largest U.S. companies. The index is calculated on a total return basis
with dividends reinvested.

TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program): A government program created for the
establishment and management of a Treasury fund, in an attempt to curb the
ongoing financial crisis of 2007-2008. The fund was created by enacting the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

Treasury-Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS): U.S. Treasury bonds and notes
whose value is adjusted according to changes to the inflation rate every six
months, as measured by the consumer price index. As inflation occurs, the value
of TIPS increases.

Indexes cited are unmanaged and not available for direct investment; therefore
their performance does not reflect the expenses associated with the active
management of an actual portfolio.

   investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
   increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
   the net assets from the beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
   in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
   asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               December 31, 2008

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's investment objective is to seek the
highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

  A. Security Valuation:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price.

   Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations
provided by a pricing service, which utilizes information with respect to
recent sales, market transactions in comparable securities, quotations from
dealers, and various relationships between securities in determining value.

   As required, some securities and other assets may be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors.

   Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing
prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily
available market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in
the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur
between the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally
traded) and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (generally,
the close of the NYSE) that may impact the value of securities traded in these
foreign markets. In these cases, information from an external vendor may be
utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to
reflect their fair value. Because the frequency of significant events is not
predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a
frequent basis.

   Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.

                                      17

<PAGE>



   The Fund has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157) as of the beginning of the current fiscal period
of the Fund. This standard clarifies the definition of fair value for financial
reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires
additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. To increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related
disclosures, the Fund utilizes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
levels:

   .   Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

   .   Level 2 -- prices determined using other significant observable inputs
       (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
       prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

   .   Level 3 -- prices determined using significant unobservable inputs
       (including the Fund's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
       investments)

   The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's net assets
as of December 31, 2008. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities
are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in
those securities.

  Total.......................................................  $456,926,098

</TABLE>

  B. Security Transactions and Related Income:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.

  C. Income Taxes:

   It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M
of the Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or
excise taxes has been made.

   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

   FASB Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, sets forth a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of
the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions and has concluded that no
provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial statements. The
Fund is not aware of any

                                      18

<PAGE>


tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months.
However, management's conclusions regarding the adoption of FIN 48 may be
subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including,
but not limited to, further implementation guidance from the FASB, new tax
laws, regulations and administrative interpretations (including court
decisions). Each of the Fund's federal tax returns for the prior three fiscal
years remains subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

  D. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest. As of
December 31, 2008, the Fund increased undistributed net investment income by
$36,483,956, decreased the accumulated net realized loss by $849,692, and
decreased capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest by $37,333,648.

   Under current tax law, foreign currency and capital losses realized after
October 31 may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund
deferred $98,885 of post-October losses.

   The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the Schedule of
Investments) consist of undistributed ordinary income of $0 and undistributed
long-term capital gains of $0.

   For the fiscal year (the "period") ended December 31, 2008, the Fund
utilized losses deferred in prior years of $4,861,360.

   In addition, under certain conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of
these losses to the extent that distributions to shareholders exceed required
distribution amounts as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders
may also pay additional taxes on these excess distributions.

  E. Foreign Currency Translation:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

  F. Foreign Security Country Determination:

   A combination of the following criteria is used to assign the countries of
risk listed in the Schedule of Investments: country of incorporation, actual
building address, primary exchange on which the security is traded and country
in which the greatest percentage of company revenue is generated.

                                      19

<PAGE>



  G. Short Sales:

   A short sale is a transaction in which the Fund sells a security it does not
own in anticipation of a decline in market price. To sell a security short, the
Fund must borrow the security. The Fund's obligation to replace the security
borrowed and sold short will be fully collateralized at all times by the
proceeds from the short sale retained by the broker and by cash and securities
deposited in a segregated account with the Fund's custodian. If the price of
the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the
time the Fund replaces the borrowed security, the Fund will realize a loss, and
if the price declines during the period, the Fund will realize a gain. Any
realized gain will be decreased, and any realized loss increased, by the amount
of transaction costs. On ex-dividend date, dividends on short sales are
recorded as an expense to the Fund. The collateral includes the deposits with
the broker for securities held short and the value of the segregated
investments held long. Short selling used in the management of the Fund may
accelerate the velocity of potential losses if the prices of securities sold
short appreciate quickly. Stocks purchased may decline in value at the same
time stocks sold short may appreciate in value, thereby increasing potential
losses.

   At December 31, 2008, there were no securities sold short.

  H. Security Lending:

   The Fund may loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement with
State Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Custodian"). Under the terms of
agreement, the Fund is required to maintain collateral with a market value not
less than 100% of the market value of loaned securities. Collateral is adjusted
daily in connection with changes in the market value of securities on loan.
Collateral may consist of cash, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or its agencies, sovereign debt of foreign countries and/or
irrevocable letters of credit issued by banks. Cash collateral is invested in a
short-term money market fund. Dividends earned on the collateral and premiums
paid by the broker are recorded as income by the Fund net of fees and rebates
charged by the Custodian for its services in connection with this securities
lending program. Lending portfolio securities involves a risk of delay in the
recovery of the loaned securities or in the foreclosure on collateral.

   At December 31, 2008, the Fund had no securities on loan.

NOTE 3 -- PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES:

NOTE 4 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   At end of business December 31, 2008, Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.
("Virtus") spun off from The Phoenix Companies, Inc., into an independent
publicly traded company. Virtus is the holding company for various asset
management subsidiaries, including Zweig Advisers, LLC (the "Adviser", formerly
known as Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC) and VP Distributors, Inc. ("VP
Distributors", formerly known as Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation). Due to
the spin-off, the asset management subsidiaries have changed their names.

   a) Investment Advisory Fee: The Investment Advisory Agreement (the
"Agreement") between the Adviser and the Fund provides that, subject to the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund and the applicable provisions
of the Act, the adviser is responsible for the actual management of the Fund's
portfolio. The responsibility for making decisions to buy, sell, or hold a
particular investment rests with the Adviser, subject to review by the Board of
Directors and the applicable provisions of the Act. For the services provided
by the Adviser under the Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee
equal, on an annual basis to 0.70% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund incurred advisory fees of
$3,621,383.

   Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), which serves as the Sub-Adviser
for the Fund, performs certain asset allocation research and analysis and
provides such advice to the Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's fees are paid by the
Adviser.

   b) Administration Fee: VP Distributors serves as the Fund's Administrator
(the "Administrator") pursuant to an Administration Agreement. The
Administrator receives a fee for financial reporting, tax services, and
oversight of the subagents' performance at a rate of 0.065% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund
incurred Administration fees of $336,271.

   c) Directors Fee: During the period the Fund paid each Director who is not
an interested person of the Fund or the Adviser a fee of $11,000 per year plus
$1,500 per Directors' or committee meeting attended, together with the
out-of-pocket costs relating to attendance at such meetings. The Audit
Committee chairperson was paid an additional fee of $5,000. Any Director of the
Fund who is an interested person of the Fund or the Adviser receives no
remuneration from the Fund.

NOTE 5 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS

   Under the Fund's organizational documents and related agreements, its
directors and officers are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters
into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these arrangements.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At December 31, 2008, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 114,594,744
shares are outstanding.

                                      21

<PAGE>



   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, 0 and 552,046 shares, respectively, were issued pursuant to the Plan.

   In a non-transferable rights offering ended May 18, 2007, shareholders
exercised rights to purchase 20,730,142 shares of common stock at an offering
price of $4.98 per share for proceeds, net of expenses, of $102,586,107.
Expenses were adjusted by $15,058 in 2008, resulting in final net proceeds of
$102,571,049.

   On January 2, 2009, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.033 per share to
shareholders of record on December 31, 2008. This distribution has an
ex-dividend date of January 5, 2009, and is payable on January 12, 2009. Please

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.

   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

NOTE 8 -- REGULATORY EXAMS

   Federal and state regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries
and conduct examinations regarding compliance by Virtus and its subsidiaries
(collectively "the Company") with securities and other laws and regulations
affecting their registered products.

NOTE 9 -- RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

   In March 2008, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161,
"Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 161) was
issued and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
November 15, 2008. FAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting for
derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors
to understand how and why a fund uses derivatives, how derivatives are
accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect a fund's results of
operations and financial position. Management is currently evaluating the
impact, if any, of FAS 161 on financial statement disclosures.

            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Zweig Total Return Fund,
Inc. (the "Fund") at December 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2008 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          provided by PwC which are not otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of
          the Audit committee, provided that such delegate reports to the full
          Audit Committee at its next meeting. The pre-approval procedures do
          not include delegation of the Audit committee's responsibilities to

                    (d)  100% for 2008 and 100% for 2007

(f)       The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
          engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
          recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
          other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
          was less than fifty percent.

(g)       The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
          services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
          investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
          primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen
          by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
          by, or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing
          services to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of
          the registrant was $1,624,671 for 2008 and $961,830 for 2007.

(h)       The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
          considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
          rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
          sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
          entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
          investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
          that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
          2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
          accountant's independence.

I    Definitions. As used in this Statement of Policy, the following terms shall
     have the meanings ascribed below:

     C.   "Delegate" refers to the Adviser or Subadviser to whom responsibility
          has been delegated to vote proxies for the applicable Portfolio
          Holding, including any qualified, independent organization engaged by
          the Adviser to vote proxies on behalf of such delegated entity.

     D.   "Fund" shall individually and collectively mean and refer to The Zweig
          Fund, Inc. and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc., and each of them.

     E.   "Management Matters" refers to stock option plans and other management
          compensation issues.

     F.   "Portfolio Holding" refers to any company or entity whose securities

          as of the date a proxy is solicited.

     G.   "Proxy Contests" refer to any meeting of shareholders of an issuer for

          one solicited by management and the others by a dissident or group of

     I.   "Takeover" refers to "hostile" or "friendly" efforts to effect radical

II.  General Policy. It is the intention of the Fund to exercise stock ownership
     rights in Portfolio Holdings in a manner that is reasonably anticipated to
     further the best economic interests of shareholders of the Fund.
     Accordingly, the Fund or its Delegate(s) shall endeavor to analyze and vote
     all proxies that are considered likely to have financial implications, and,
     where appropriate, to participate in corporate governance, shareholder
     proposals, management communications and legal proceedings. The Fund and
     its Delegate(s) must also identify potential or actual conflicts of
     interests in voting proxies and address any such conflict of interest in
     accordance with this Statement of Policy.

III  Factors to consider when voting.

     A.   A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect
          on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the Portfolio
          Holding is indeterminable or insignificant.

     B    In analyzing anti-takeover measures, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
          long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
          industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,
          without limitation, five-year annual compound growth rates for sales,
          operating income, net income, and total shareholder returns (share
          price appreciation plus dividends). Other financial indicators that
          will be considered include margin analysis, cash flow, and debit
          levels.

<PAGE>


     C.   In analyzing contested elections, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as the
          qualifications of all director nominees. The Delegate shall also
          consider the independence and attendance record of board and key
          committee members. A review of the corporate governance profile shall
          be completed highlighting entrenchment devices that may reduce
          accountability.

     D.   In analyzing corporate governance matters, the Delegate shall vote on
          a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as tax and
          economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
          incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
          changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
          supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and
          bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

     E.   In analyzing executive compensation proposals and management matters,
          the Adviser shall vote on a case-by-case basis taking into
          consideration such factors as executive pay and spending on
          perquisites, particularly in conjunction with sub-par performance and
          employee layoffs.

     F.   In analyzing proxy contests for control, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
          financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
          management's track record; background to the proxy contest;
          qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation of what
          each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the
          proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership
          positions.

     G.   A Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder social matters
          proposals.

IV   Delegation.

     A.   In the absence of a specific direction to the contrary from the Board
          of Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will be responsible for voting
          proxies for all Portfolio Holdings in accordance with this Statement
          of Policy, or for delegating such responsibility as described below.

     B.   The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
          Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the
          best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall
          accept direction or inappropriate influence from any other client,
          director or employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any
          vote inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the
          prior approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).

     C.   With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
          Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
          satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
          Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
          pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
          Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
          thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
          Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
          with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
          however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its
          own proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
          following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
          approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
          determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed
          to further the best economic interests of the affected Fund
          shareholders, and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and
          approved annually by the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will
          promptly notify the Adviser of any material changes to the Subadviser
          Procedures. The Adviser will periodically review the votes by the
          Subadviser for consistency with this Statement of Policy.

V.   Conflicts of Interest

     A.   The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived
          conflicts of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings
          between the interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of
          the Adviser, Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          of the Fund, on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into
          account a wide array of factors in determining whether such a conflict
          exists, whether such conflict is material in nature, and how to
          properly address or resolve the same.

     B.   While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
          presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
          or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
          otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
          conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote)
          proxies pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the
          recommendations of an established, independent third party with
          qualifications to vote proxies such as Institutional Shareholder
          Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the recommendation of the proposing
          Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or (iv) where two or more Delegates
          provide conflicting requests, vote shares in proportion to the assets
          under management of the each proposing Delegate.

     C.   The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
          actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
          recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
          shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
          any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
          of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
          Article.

     D.   In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
          Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
          scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
          shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
          apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
          determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.

VI.  Miscellaneous.

     A.   A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting
          and the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio
          Holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
          justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and
          available upon request.

     B.   The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from
          this Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the
          Board of Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of
          Trustees may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to
          the Fund or any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy
          voting pursuant to this Statement of Policy at such times and in such
          format or medium as the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser
          shall be solely responsible for complying with the disclosure and
          reporting requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
          including, without limitation, Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
          Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser shall gather, collate and present
          information relating to the its proxy voting activities of those of
          each Delegate in such format and medium as the Fund shall determine
          from time to time in order for the Fund to discharge its disclosure
          and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment
          Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     C.   The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
          Portfolio Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting
          the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which such
          proxies were voted.

     D.   The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
          committee established from time to time by the Adviser, as the case
          may be. In performing its duties hereunder, the Adviser, or any

<PAGE>


          duly authorized committee, may engage the services of a research
          and/or voting adviser or agent, the cost of which shall be borne by
          such entity.

     This Statement of Policy shall be presented to the Board of Trustees
     annually for their amendment and/or approval.

          Potential Conflicts of Interests

          There may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in
          connection with the Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's management of each
          Fund's investments and the investments of any other accounts he
          manages. Such conflicts could arise from the aggregation of orders for
          all accounts managed by a particular portfolio manager, the allocation
          of purchases across all such accounts, the allocation of IPOs and any
          soft dollar arrangements that the Adviser may have in place that could
          benefit the Funds and/or such other accounts. The Board of
          Trustees/Directors has adopted on behalf of the Funds policies and
          procedures designed to address any such conflicts of interest to
          ensure that all transactions are executed in the best interest of the
          Funds' shareholders. The Advisers and Sub adviser are required to
          certify their compliance with these procedures to the Board of
          Trustees on a quarterly basis. There have been no material compliance
          issues with respect to any of these policies and procedures during the
          Funds' most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Additionally,
          there are no material conflicts of interest between the investment
          strategy of a Fund and the investment strategy of other accounts
          managed by Mr. Neel and Mr. Dickerson since portfolio managers
          generally manage funds and other accounts having similar investment
          strategies.

(a)(3)    Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team
          Members

          For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2008,
          following is a description of Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's
          compensation structure as portfolio managers of ZA and Euclid.

          Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (formerly known as Phoenix Investment
          Partners, Ltd.) and its affiliated investment management firms
          (collectively, "Virtus"), believe that the firm's compensation program
          is adequate and competitive to attract and retain high-caliber
          investment professionals. Investment professionals at Virtus receive a
          competitive base salary, an incentive bonus opportunity and a benefits
          package. Certain investment professionals who supervise and manage
          others also participate in a management incentive program reflecting
          their personal contribution and team performance. Certain key
          individuals may also participate in a long-term Incentive Compensation
          program, including potential awards of Virtus restricted stock units
          ("RSUs") with multi-year vesting, subject to Virtus board approval,
          and opportunities to defer their compensation and reduce tax
          implications.

          The bonus package for portfolio managers is based upon how well the
          individual manager meets or exceeds assigned goals and subjective
          assessment of contribution to the team effort. Their incentive bonus
          also reflects a performance component for achieving and/or exceeding
          performance competitive with peers managing similar strategies. Such
          component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for
          managing within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary
          risks. This ensures that investment personnel will remain focused on
          managing and acquiring securities that correspond to a fund's mandate
          and risk profile. It also avoids the temptation for portfolio managers
          to take on more risk and unnecessary exposure to chase performance for
          personal gain.

<PAGE>


          Prior to the Spin-off of Virtus from Phoenix Companies, Inc. ("PNX")
          on December 31, 2008, certain compensation awards were paid in PNX
          RSUs, which converted to Virtus RSUs at Spin-off. Other than as
          described here, no material changes have been made to the compensation
          structure as a result of the Spin-off.

          In summary, the Investment Manager believes that overall compensation
          is both fair and competitive while rewarding employees for not taking
          unnecessary risks to chase personal performance.

          Following is a more detailed description of the compensation structure
          of the Fund's portfolio managers.

          Base Salary. Each Portfolio Manager is paid a fixed base salary, which
          is determined by Virtus and is designed to be competitive in light of
          the individual's experience and responsibilities. Virtus management
          uses compensation survey results of investment industry compensation
          conducted by an independent third party in evaluating competitive
          market compensation for its investment management professionals.

          Incentive Bonus. Incentive bonus pools are based upon individual firm
          profits and in some instances overall Virtus profitability. The short-
          term incentive payment is generally paid in cash, but a portion may be
          made in Virtus RSUs. Individual payments are assessed using
          comparisons of actual investment performance compared with specific
          peer groups established at the beginning of each calendar year.
          Performance of the funds managed is measured over one, three and five
          year periods. Generally, an individual manager's participation is
          based on the performance of each fund/account managed as weighted
          roughly by total assets in each of these funds/accounts. In certain
          instances comparison of portfolio risk factors to peer or index risk
          factors, as well as achievement of qualitative goals, may also be
          components of the individual payment potential.

          The Performance Incentive Plan applicable to some portfolio managers
          varies from the description above. For instance, plans applicable to
          certain portfolio managers (i) may have an override based upon
          revenues generated (ii) may contain a component that is based on the
          profitability of the management division with which the portfolio
          manager is associated, or (iii) may contain a guarantee payout.

          Other Benefits. Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
          broad-based plans offered generally to the firm's employees, including
          401(k), health and other employee benefit plans.

(a)(4)    Disclosure of Securities Ownership

          For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2008,
          beneficial ownership of shares of the Fund by Messrs. Dickerson and
          Neel are as follows. Beneficial ownership was determined in accordance
          with rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17
          CFR 240.161-1(a)(2)).

                              THE ZWEIG FUND, INC.
                        THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.
                        SENIOR MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS

I    Background

     Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that each registered
investment company disclose whether or not it has adopted a code of ethics that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the fund or a
third party (collectively, "Senior Management"). If a fund has not adopted such
a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so in certain regulatory
filings.

     Pursuant to various management agreements between The Zweig Fund, Inc. and
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") and Phoenix subsidiaries,
Phoenix employees currently serve as Senior Management to the Funds. As
employees of Phoenix they are subject to the Phoenix Code of Ethics (the "PCE").
The PCE complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other relevant
requirements. The Boards of Directors of the Funds, on October 1, 2003, adopted
the Phoenix Code of Ethics for the Senior Management of the Funds.

II   Board Resolution adopted on October 1, 2003

     WHEREAS, that Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that
each registered investment company publicly disclose whether or not it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals
are employed by the fund or a third party (collectively, "Senior Management");
and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
as presented at this meeting, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"Senior Management Code") and has determined the same to provide written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the
types of conduct by Senior Management that are contemplated by regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; now, therefore, be it

     RESOLVED, that the Fund does hereby approve and adopt the Senior Management
Code as the written code of ethics that applies to its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
individuals are employed by the Fund or a third party;

     FURTHER RESOLVED, the Chairman of the Fund, with the advice of counsel and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
shall be appointed and directed to oversee the consideration and granting of any
waivers of the Senior Management Code with respect to Senior Management other
than the Chairman provided however that the Chairman shall provide notice of any
such waiver to the Board of Directors at the next succeeding regularly scheduled
meeting of the Board of Directors and provided further that any requested
waivers involving the Chairman shall be presented to the Board for approval; and

     FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Compliance Officer of The Phoenix
Companies, Inc. be, and she or he hereby is, authorized and directed to
implement, and oversee compliance with, and administration of the Senior
Management Code and to take such further action and

<PAGE>


deliver and execute any and all instruments, certificates and documents as she
or he may deem necessary or appropriate, with the advice of counsel, to fully
carry out the purposes and intent of the Senior Management Code.

Commitment to Shareholders

Phoenix is committed to providing shareholder value. One way we do this is by
observing the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct in all of our
business dealings.

Conflicts of Interest

Phoenix expects each of its employees and directors to maintain the highest
moral and ethical standards and to avoid conflicts of interest in conducting
business activities. A "conflict of interest" occurs when an individual's
private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, in any way with the
interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an
employee or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee or director, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her
position in the Company.

An employee requested by Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another
company owes a fiduciary duty to Phoenix as well as to the company on whose
board of directors he or she serves. Where conflicts of interest arise between
the interests of Phoenix and the other company, the employee should consult
Phoenix's General Counsel for guidance. Moreover, no employee requested by
Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another company may accept fees or
other compensation for board service. In the event the company for which an
employee serves as a director requires directors to receive fees, any
remuneration received by the employee must be donated to a charitable
organization. The Company will offset any tax consequences incurred by the
employee.

All conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing to the Chief Compliance
Officer. Employees and directors are required to file a Conflict of Interest
Statement annually. Any conflicts of interest that arise following completion of
the Conflict of Interest Statement must be promptly reported to the Chief
Compliance Officer in writing.

Corporate Opportunities

Employees and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate
interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently, employees and
directors are prohibited from engaging in the following activities:

..    taking for themselves personal opportunities that are discovered through
     the use of corporate property, information or position;

..    using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and

..    competing with the Company.

Insider Trading and Personal Trading

Federal securities laws and Company policy prohibit the purchase or sale of
securities while in possession of material non-public information and prohibit
passing such information on to others. No employee or director may buy or sell
Phoenix securities if he or she has material non-public information. This
restriction also applies to an employee's or director's spouse, other adults
living in the employee's or director's household, minor children and persons for
whom the employee exercises investment authority. Employees, directors and their
family members also must avoid passing non-public information on to third
parties.

<PAGE>


Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would probably consider the
information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of the
company to which the information relates.

Directors, officers and their family members1 are also subject to certain
restrictions under New York Insurance Law governing acquisition of Phoenix
shares. Until June 25, 2006, directors and officers, whether acting directly or
indirectly, may only acquire, or offer to acquire, such shares: (i) through a
Phoenix plan; or (ii) through a registered broker or dealer at quoted prices on
the date of purchase. Family members may only acquire such shares through the
latter method. All directors, all employees with a title of Vice President or
higher, plus certain other employees whose positions place them in regular
contact with non-public information, and certain family members of all of them
are subject to a further restriction as well: these individuals may only buy or
sell Phoenix securities during "window" periods. You have been or will be
notified: (i) if these restrictions apply to you; and (ii) when periods begin
and end.

In addition, officers with a title of Executive Vice President or higher,
certain other individuals who have been notified by the Corporate Secretary, and
certain family members of each of them, must pre-clear all transactions in
Phoenix securities through our Corporate Secretary. Further, they must promptly
report such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

No employee or director may buy or sell securities of another company with the
knowledge that those securities are being considered for purchase or sale by
Phoenix, any of its subsidiaries or any of the Company's advisory accounts. In
the case of any company in which Phoenix owns 10 percent or more of the
outstanding equity, no employee (nor certain family members) may make any
personal investment without prior approval from the Law Department.

Certain employees who are involved with the Company's investment adviser and
broker-dealer operations may be required to secure pre-clearance of and/or
report all personal securities transactions by these individuals. In addition,
the Company reserves the right to require duplicate confirmations, quarterly
transaction reports and prior clearance for any personal securities transactions
by those individuals. If you have any question as to whether your position
requires pre-clearance or reporting, you should contact the compliance officer
for your business area (investment adviser or broker-dealer) or the Corporate
Compliance Department.

Footnote 1 An officer's or director's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,
step-parent, grandparent, spouse, or sibling, including in-laws and adoptive
relationships.

Market Timing

Company policy prohibits employees from engaging in excessive trading or market
timing activities with respect to any mutual fund, regardless of whether such
mutual fund is affiliated with the Company. This prohibition does not apply to
money market funds or other funds designed to permit short term investment or to
non-volitional investment vehicles such as 401(k) plans, automatic reinvestment
programs, or asset allocation programs.

Confidentiality

Directors and employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of
information entrusted to them in the course of their work for the Company.
Disclosure of confidential information is restricted to authorized persons or
situations in which disclosure is legally mandated. Confidential information
includes all non-public information about the Company or persons with which it
conducts business (such as customers, vendors and potential investment targets)
including, but not limited to: internal operating procedures; investment
strategies; sales data and customer lists; financial plans; projections; and
clients' personal information. (See also Privacy and Confidential Personal
Information below). A director's or employee's obligation to protect
confidential information continues even after termination of his or her position
with the Company.

<PAGE>


Protection and Use of Company Property and Assets

Employees have access to Company property to assist them in effectively carrying
out their duties to the Company. Company property should only be used for
legitimate purposes. All employees should protect the Company's property and
ensure its efficient use. Theft, fraud, carelessness and waste have a direct
impact on the Company's profitability.

Examples of Company property include proprietary and non-public information,
equipment, facilities, vehicles, funds and other assets. Improper use or abuse
of Company property is prohibited. Expenses to be paid for by the Company, via
reimbursement or direct payment, are limited to those expenses that are
authorized and related to legitimate business activities.

Contract Review

The following contracts must be reviewed by the Law Department prior to being
signed, amended or terminated early:

..    Contracts that involve an expenditure or value of greater than $25,000;

..    Contracts that pose significant legal obligations on Phoenix (such as an
     obligation not to solicit business, not to hire, or to provide
     indemnification); and

..    Contracts that involve employment or consulting services.

In addition, contracts that could have a significant impact on Phoenix's
financial results or reports must be reviewed by Corporate Finance for business
risks and financial implications.

Corporate Disclosures

As a public company, Phoenix is required to publicly disclose certain
information on a regular basis. This includes financial information and other
material information about the Company. It is imperative that such information
be disseminated in a consistent manner and in accordance with SEC disclosure
requirements and Company policy. In order to ensure that information released is
accurate and properly disseminated, only certain individuals are authorized to
speak on behalf of the Company. Employees are prohibited from speaking with
rating agencies, analysts, investors or the press without obtaining prior
authorization from the President and Chief Executive Officer. Employees
receiving any such inquiries should refer such individuals to the appropriate
area for response:

..    Members of the Press - to the senior officer, Corporate Communications;

..    Rating Agencies - to any officer in the Rating Agency Relations unit; and

..    Securities Analysts and Investors - to any officer in the Investor
     Relations unit.

In order to enable the Company to comply with applicable law, Company policy
prohibits directors and employees from publicly disclosing any non-public
information about the Company's financial performance, other than at times and
through methods approved by the Company's President or Chief Financial Officer.
Employees are also prohibited from commenting on the Company's stock
performance.

Accuracy and Retention of Company Records

The integrity of Phoenix's records is vital to the Company's continued success.
The falsification, misuse or inappropriate alteration of Company documents is
strictly prohibited.

Phoenix's business transactions must be accurately recorded on the Company's
books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
any other required accounting basis and established Company policy. Financial
information must fairly represent all relevant information.

The retention and destruction of Company records must follow established Company
policies and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

<PAGE>


Commitment to Customers

Phoenix upholds its commitment to our customers by conducting our business
fairly and honestly and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all
dealings with customers.

Safeguarding Customer Assets

Employees have an obligation to safeguard the assets of our customers at all
times, and to protect them from all forms of misuse. Misappropriation of funds
can include theft, fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized borrowing. Employees must
not, under any circumstances, misappropriate funds, property or other assets, or
assist another individual in doing so.

Ethical Market Conduct

The Company expects all who are involved in the sales and marketing of its
products and services to abide by the following principles:

..    conduct business according to high standards of honesty and fairness;

..    provide competent and customer-focused sales and service;

..    engage in active and fair competition;

..    provide clear, honest and fair advertising and sales materials;

..    handle customer complaints and disputes in an appropriate and timely
     manner; and

..    monitor sales and service procedures to help ensure compliance with ethical
     market conduct.

Privacy and Confidential Personal Information

It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain the privacy of
confidential personal information. Confidential personal information includes
non-public financial and health information obtained from consumers and
customers in connection with providing a financial product or service. Specific
examples of confidential personal information include information concerning
assets, income, businesses, estates, financial plans or health.

The misuse of confidential personal information could subject the Company and
its employees to civil liability or criminal penalties. Before releasing
confidential information to anyone, employees must make certain that releasing
it is permitted under the Company's policies or authorized in writing by the
person to whom it relates.

Customer Complaints

The Company is committed to fairly and expeditiously handling all customer
complaints. All complaints must be handled and reported in accordance with
established corporate policies as well as procedures established for the
applicable business unit or affiliate. To facilitate resolution of each customer
complaint, as well as to facilitate any related regulatory inquiries, all
customer complaints and related communications are centrally retained.

Fraud

The Company strongly supports all efforts to detect and prevent fraud. It
believes that only through aggressive action to combat fraud can the Company
continue to meet its fundamental obligations to its stockholders and customers.
When there is reason to believe that the Company has been the target of fraud or
attempted fraud, it will aggressively work with the appropriate law enforcement
officials to seek prosecution and conviction of the responsible individual(s).
Any employee who is aware or suspects that the Company has been the target of
fraud or attempted fraud should report it to the Corporate Audit Department
immediately.

Insurance Anti-Fraud Plan

In accordance with insurance regulatory requirements, the Company has a
comprehensive insurance anti-fraud plan that is designed to:

<PAGE>


..    prevent insurance fraud, including internal fraud involving the Company's
     officers, employees or agents, fraud resulting from misrepresentations on
     applications for insurance, and claims fraud;

..    report insurance fraud to appropriate law enforcement and regulatory
     authorities;

..    encourage cooperation in the prosecution of insurance fraud cases; and

..    aggressively pursue recovery of all sums improperly paid by the Company as
     a result of fraud.

Commitment to Corporate Citizenship

Phoenix is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, which includes
complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we
operate as well as engaging in fair competition in the marketplace.

Complying with Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The Company expects all employees to conduct business in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations related to the
financial services industry are complex, thus placing a duty on each employee to
take all reasonable steps to ensure his or her actions are in compliance.
Compliance with the law does not, however, comprise our entire ethical
responsibility. Rather, it is a minimum standard for performance of our duties.
(See also the provisions below on Commitment to Ethics and Compliance).

Accounting, Internal Accounting Controls and Auditing Matters

The Company treats complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls, or
auditing matters seriously and expeditiously. Employees have the opportunity to
submit confidential and anonymous complaints about accounting or auditing
matters for review by representatives of Phoenix, and if appropriate, the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors. These complaints will be handled in a
manner that protects the confidentiality and anonymity of the employee when so
requested by the employee. (See the Toll-Free Help Line section of this Code, on
page 11). No employee will be terminated or otherwise retaliated against for
submitting a complaint under this procedure if he or she reasonably believes
that the complaint may involve a violation of federal securities or anti-fraud
laws.

Fair Dealing

Each employee must deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone
through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information,
misrepresentation of material facts, or other unfair-dealing practice.

Antitrust

The Company is committed to preserving a free and competitive marketplace and
will not engage in any understandings or agreements with any competitor that
could result in a restraint of trade. Employees must avoid engaging in any
conduct that violates the antitrust laws, such as agreements with competitors
regarding prices, terms of sale, division of markets and allocations of
customers. Discussions with competitors related to market share, projected sales
for any specific product or service, revenues and expenses, production
schedules, unannounced products and services, pricing or marketing strategies
are prohibited.

The antitrust laws and, thus, the above prohibitions, also apply to informal
contacts with competitors, such as encounters at trade shows or meetings of
professional organizations. Every employee has an obligation to avoid situations
that could result in a violation of the antitrust laws.

<PAGE>


Anti-Money Laundering

It is the responsibility of every employee to protect the Company from
exploitation by individuals engaged in money laundering activities. Accordingly,
affected employees must:

..    become familiar with the anti-money laundering laws and their requirements
     as applied to the Company; and

..    learn and fully comply with the Company's anti-money laundering policies
     and procedures.

Failure to comply with applicable laws or the Company's policies may result in
significant criminal and civil penalties for the Company as well as for those
individuals involved. Furthermore, even association with money laundering
activity could subject both the Company and its employees to civil and criminal
penalties.

Lobbying and Political Contributions

Lobbying is generally defined as communicating with a public official, or a
member of his or her staff, in the legislative or executive branch of
government, for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action.
Lobbying is highly regulated and lobbyists are required to be registered and to
report their activities. No employee may engage in lobbying on behalf of Phoenix
without prior permission of the Law Department. The giving of gifts to local
public officials and members of their staff, whether in the form of meals,
tickets to events or otherwise, is strictly regulated by most states and by the
federal government. Special restrictions also apply to employees who provide
investment management services to public entities.

Employees must be careful to distinguish between personal and corporate
political activities. Unless specifically requested by the Company to
communicate on its behalf on a particular issue, you should identify
communications with legislators as expressing your own personal beliefs and not
those of Phoenix. The use of Phoenix stationery for any personal political
communication is prohibited. Any employee wishing to be a candidate for elective
office should consult with his or her supervisor and department head in advance.

Questions regarding the Company's position on proposed legislation or
regulations should be directed to Government Relations or the Law Department.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits the payment or authorization of the
payment of any money, or the giving of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of:

..    influencing any act or decision of the foreign official; or

..    inducing the foreign official to use his influence to assist in obtaining
     business for or directing business to any person.

A "foreign official" is any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of a
foreign government, agency, department or instrumentality. Also included under
the term "foreign official" are foreign political parties, officials of
political parties and candidates for foreign political office.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to all directors, employees and agents
of the Company. Violation of the act can result in both fines and imprisonment.

Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents

Employees must avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others.
Intellectual property includes copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents
and trade secrets. Improper use includes copying, distributing or modifying
third party copyrighted materials without permission. Infringement may result in
criminal as well as civil liabilities for Phoenix and its employees. The Company
has an agreement with the Copyright Clearance Center that gives a license to
Phoenix employees to make photocopies of many publications for business
purposes. Questions about the types of copying that are covered by the agreement
should be directed to the Corporate Compliance Department.

<PAGE>


Commitment to Employees

Phoenix's employees are our most important asset and we are committed to
fostering a work environment in which employees have the opportunity to grow,
contribute and participate free from discrimination.

Equal Opportunity

The Company employs and promotes on the basis of merit and achievement without
regard to age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, marital status, or disability. This policy applies to every phase
of the employment process and every aspect of the employment relationship:
recruitment, hiring, training, promotions, transfers, terminations, benefits,
compensation and participation in Company-sponsored educational, social and
recreational programs.

Sexual Harassment

The Company prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment
includes: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal, visual or physical conduct when:

..    submission is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a
     person's employment;

..    submission to or rejection of inappropriate conduct by an employee is used
     as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or

..    the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
     individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
     offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment also includes: unwelcome sexual flirtations and advances;
verbal abuse of a sexual nature; inappropriate touching; graphic or verbal
comments about an individual's body; displaying in the workplace a sexually
suggestive object or picture; and sexually explicit or offensive jokes.

Employment of Relatives

Except in the limited circumstances described in this section, the Company does
not permit the employment of a director's or employee's "relative", which term
includes a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, step-parent,
step-child, step-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece,
or first cousin including in-laws. Specifically, the Company prohibits the
hiring of a "relative" of any director or officer, or of any employee working in
the Corporate Audit, Corporate Compliance, Human Resources or Law Departments.
Although this policy does not require the termination of any employee who
becomes related to a person described in the preceding sentence through a
post-hiring event such as marriage or a promotion, any employee who becomes
"related" through such an occurrence should promptly advise his or her
supervisor. The Company will then take steps to assure that no employee reports
to or supervises a relative and that related employees do not work in the same
department or report to the same supervisor. The employment of a "relative" of
any officer at the level of Executive Vice President or higher will not be
permitted or accommodated even if the relationship results from a post-hiring
event.

Workplace Safety

The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment that is safe and
healthy for its employees and others. All job-related injuries or illnesses
should be reported immediately to your supervisor or Human Resources
representative. Questions concerning health and safety matters should also be
referred to one of them.

The Company does not tolerate acts of violence or threats of violence against
employees or Company property. Possession of firearms or other weapons anywhere
on Company property or while conducting Company business is prohibited. Any
situation or concern involving violent

<PAGE>


behavior or the threat of violence should be immediately reported to Security or
Human Resources.

Drugs and Alcohol

The sale, purchase, use, possession or transfer of narcotics or other legally
controlled substances by employees while on Company premises or on Company
business (other than use of prescription drugs in accordance with a physician's
orders) is prohibited. Employees attending functions on behalf of the Company
where alcohol is served are expected to use good judgment and avoid consuming
excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages.

Felony Convictions

Federal law prohibits the employment by an insurance company, without the
consent of the appropriate state insurance department, of any person convicted
of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust. To assist the Company in
fulfilling its responsibilities under this law, employees are required to
disclose any felony conviction to the Company at the time of application for
employment. Any employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony must report
this fact to the Company immediately.

Employee Ownership of Phoenix Stock

Employees and directors are subject to various requirements governing their
ownership of Company stock, including federal securities law and New York
insurance law. Please refer to the Insider Trading and Personal Trading section
of this Code (at page 1) for more information.

Commitment to Ethics and Compliance

A strong commitment to business ethics and compliance is the foundation of a
successful organization. Every employee is expected to carry out the Company's
business activities in an ethical manner and in a fashion consistent with
applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidelines.

Ethical Decision Making

Phoenix's success is dependent on each of us applying the highest ethical
standards to whatever we do on behalf of the Company. Employees should consider
the following questions before making decisions.

..    Is my action consistent with approved Company practices?

..    Is my action consistent with the Company's values?

..    Does my action give the appearance of impropriety?

..    Can I, in good conscience, defend my action to my supervisor, other
     employees and the general public?

..    Does my action meet my personal code of ethical behavior?

..    Does my action conform to the spirit of these and all other applicable
     guidelines?

Monitoring Code Compliance

The Corporate Compliance and the Corporate Audit Departments are responsible for
monitoring the compliance activities of all areas of the Company and for
ensuring that this Code of Conduct is being followed. Compliance will be
monitored by periodic audits where appropriate. Additionally, the Company's
Chief Compliance Officer must report annually to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors on the level of compliance with our requirement that each
employee and director complete the Code of Conduct Acknowledgement and the
Conflict of Interest Declaration. Waivers of violations of the Code by directors
or by officers with a title of Senior Vice President or higher may only be
granted by the Audit Committee or the Board. Such waivers must be promptly
reported to shareholders. All other waivers, which may be granted by

<PAGE>


the Chief Compliance Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President,
shall be reported to the Audit Committee but need not be reported to the
shareholders.

Toll-Free Help Line

Phoenix maintains a confidential, 24-hour, toll-free telephone help line for
employees for the purpose of requesting assistance concerning, or reporting
violations of, this Code or reporting complaints about accounting or auditing
matters. The number is: 1-800-813-8180.

Assistance is available during regular business hours. If you call outside of
regular business hours, you may leave a confidential message and your call will
be returned the following business day. Special security measures have been
taken with this help line to ensure confidentiality. If you wish to remain
anonymous, you may request a case identification number and refer to that number
in subsequent phone calls.

Obligation to Report

Employees are obligated to report suspected violations of this Code to their
department head, the Chief Compliance Officer or the Law Department.

Whistleblower Protection

No retaliation or retribution of any kind will be taken against an employee who,
in good faith, reports a suspected violation of this Code.

Investigation

All allegations of suspected violations will be promptly investigated and
appropriate action will be taken. Investigations will be conducted in an
objective, professional manner. The specifics of an investigation, including the
identity of the individual reporting the information, will be kept confidential
except as such disclosure is necessary to fully investigate the allegations,
facilitate resolution and/or report the results to appropriate authorities.

Disclosure to Government Authorities

Certain actions and omissions prohibited by this Code may also violate criminal
laws and may subject violators to criminal prosecution. The Law Department will
review the results of investigations that indicate potential violations of
criminal law and recommend to the appropriate senior officers whether disclosure
to appropriate enforcement authorities is warranted.

Disciplinary Action for Violations

Failure to adhere to this Code, other Company policies or applicable laws or
government regulations may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Situations in which disciplinary action may be
appropriate include the following, insofar as they relate to conduct of the
Company's business:

..    authorization of or participation in activities that violate the law,
     government regulations, this Code or other Company policies;

..    retaliation, direct or indirect, or encouragement of others to retaliate
     against a Company employee who reports a suspected violation;

..    failure to cooperate with an investigation of suspected violations,
     including interfering with or obstructing an investigation; and

..    failure to report a suspected violation of the law, government regulations,
     this Code or other Company policies.

      January 10, 2008 is reportable for tax on Form 1099 in 2007.)

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized
capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of
capital. A return of capital may occur when some or all of the money that you
invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does
not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be
confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may
be subject to change based on tax regulations. You will receive a Form 1099-DIV
for the calendar year that will explain how to report these distributions for
federal income tax purposes.

Information regarding the Fund's performance and distribution rates is set forth
below. Please note that all performance figures are based on the Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") and not the market price of the Fund's shares. Performance
figures are not meant to represent individual shareholder performance.
