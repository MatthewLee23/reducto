1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (the "Trust" or the "Fund")
is a non-diversified  closed-end  management  investment company organized under
the laws of the State of Delaware and registered  under the  Investment  Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Trust sold 7,184 shares to Gabelli
Funds,  LLC (the  "Adviser")  for  $137,214 on  November  18,  2003.  Investment
operations commenced on November 28, 2003. See Note 5 for share transactions.

     The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return

to  achieve  its  investment   objective  by  investing,   under  normal  market
conditions,  at least 80% of its assets in dividend paying  securities  (such as
common and preferred stock) or other income producing  securities (such as fixed
income  debt  securities  and  securities  that  are  convertible   into  equity
securities).

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good faith,  to reflect its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by the Adviser.

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are  generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close of the foreign  markets,  but prior to the close
of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change
significantly,  certain  foreign  securities  may be  fair  valued  pursuant  to
procedures  established  by the  Board.  Debt  instruments  that are not  credit
impaired  with  remaining  maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost,  unless the Board  determines such amount does not reflect the securities'
fair value, in which case these securities will be valued at their fair value as
determined by the Board. Debt instruments having a maturity greater than 60 days
for which  market  quotations  are  readily  available  are valued at the latest
average of the bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on
such day, the security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts
are valued at the closing  settlement price of the exchange or board of trade on
which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under  procedures
established by and under the general  supervision  of the Board.  Fair valuation
methodologies  and procedures may include,  but are not limited to: analysis and
review of available  financial and non-financial  information about the company;
comparisons  to the  valuation  and changes in valuation of similar  securities,
including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value
ADR  securities at the close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other
information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The Trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or with other brokers or dealers
that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the  Adviser  and  reviewed by the
Board.  Under the  terms of a  typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Trust  takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Trust to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during

                                       12

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     the Trust's  holding  period.  The Trust will always  receive and  maintain
securities as collateral whose market value, including accrued interest, will be
at least  equal  to 102% of the  dollar  amount  invested  by the  Trust in each
agreement.  The Trust will make payment for such  securities  only upon physical
delivery  or upon  evidence  of book entry  transfer  of the  collateral  to the
account of the custodian.  To the extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds
one business  day, the value of the  collateral is  marked-to-market  on a daily
basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral. If the seller defaults and the
value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with
respect to the seller of the  security,  realization  of the  collateral  by the
Trust may be delayed or limited.

     OPTIONS.  The Trust may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Trust  receives a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial instrument  underlying the option. The Trust would incur a loss if the
price of the  underlying  financial  instrument  decreases  between the date the
option is  written  and the date on which the  option is  terminated.  The Trust
would  realize  a gain,  to the  extent  of the  premium,  if the  price  of the
financial instrument increases between those dates.

     As a purchaser  of put  options,  the Trust pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If the price of the  underlying
security declines,  the Trust would realize a gain upon sale or exercise. If the
price of the  underlying  security  increases or stays the same, the Trust would
realize a loss upon sale or at  expiration  date,  but only to the extent of the
premium paid.

     In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred  to as
"in-the-money,"  "at-the-money" and "out-of-the-money,"  respectively. The Trust
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) covered  at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects
that the  price  of the  underlying  security  will  remain  stable  or  advance
moderately during the option period and (c)  out-of-the-money  call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the  appreciation in the price of the underlying  security above
the exercise price.  By writing a call option,  the Trust limits its opportunity
to profit from any increase in the market value of the underlying security above
the  exercise   price  of  the  option.   Out-of-the-money,   at-the-money   and
in-the-money  put options  (the  reverse of call  options as to the  relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market  environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions.

     SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Trust  may  enter  into  interest  rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Trust would agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap
(which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate  payment in
exchange  for the  counterparty  agreeing  to pay to the  Trust  periodically  a
variable rate payment that is intended to approximate the Trust's  variable rate
payment  obligation on the Series B and Series C Preferred Stock. In an interest
rate cap, the Trust would pay a premium to the  counterparty  and, to the extent
that a specified  variable rate index exceeds a predetermined  fixed rate, would
receive from the  counterparty  payments of the difference based on the notional
amount of such cap. Interest rate swap and cap transactions introduce additional
risk because the Trust would remain  obligated to pay preferred  stock dividends
when due in accordance with the Articles  Supplementary even if the counterparty
defaulted.  If there is a default by the  counterparty  to a swap contract,  the
Trust will be limited to contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related
to the transaction.  There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties
will be able to meet their  obligations  pursuant to the swap contracts or that,
in the  event of  default,  the  Trust  will  succeed  in  pursuing  contractual
remedies. The Trust thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented
from  obtaining  payments  owed  to it  pursuant  to  the  swap  contracts.  The
creditworthiness  of the swap contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in
order to  minimize  this  risk.  Depending  on the  general  state of short term
interest rates and the returns on the Trust's portfolio securities at that point
in time, such a default could negatively affect the Trust's ability

                                       13

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)


to make  dividend  payments  for the Series B and Series C Preferred  Stock.  In
addition,  at the time an  interest  rate swap or cap  transaction  reaches  its
scheduled  termination  date, there is a risk that the Trust will not be able to
obtain a replacement  transaction or that the terms of the replacement  will not
be as favorable as on the expiring transaction.  If this occurs, it could have a
negative impact on the Trust's ability to make dividend payments on the Series B
and Series C Preferred Stock.

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market risk in excess of the amount  recognized  in the  Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

     Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and  unrealized
losses  are   reported  as  a  liability   on  the   Statement   of  Assets  and
Liabilities. The change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic
amounts of interest  to be paid or  received on swaps is reported as  unrealized
gains or  losses  in the  Statement  of  Operations. A realized  gain or loss is
recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic  payment or  termination  of swap
agreements. Swap agreements involve, to varying degrees,  elements of market and
counterparty  risk,  and  exposure  to loss in  excess  of the  related  amounts
reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

     The Trust has entered into one interest rate swap  agreement  with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement the Trust receives a variable rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2005 are as follows:

     FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Trust  may  engage in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase. Such investments will only be
made if they are economically  appropriate to the reduction of risks involved in
the  management  of the  Trust's  investments.  Upon  entering  into  a  futures
contract,  the Trust is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Trust each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuation  of the
value of the  contract.  The daily  changes  in the  contract  are  included  in
unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on investments and futures contracts. The
Trust  recognizes a realized  gain or loss when the contract is closed.  At June
30, 2005, there were no open futures contracts.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures  contracts as
a hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged  investments.  These  contracts may involve market
risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss  reflected  in the  Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.  In addition, there is the risk that the Fund may not be
able to enter  into a  closing  transaction  because  of an  illiquid  secondary
market.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Trust may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations. When the contract is closed, the Trust records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     The  use  of  forward  foreign   exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Trust's portfolio  securities,  but
it does  establish  a rate of  exchange  that  can be  achieved  in the  future.
Although  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  limit the risk of loss due to a
decline in the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain
that might result should the value of the currency increase. These contracts may
involve  market risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  In addition, the Trust could be exposed to
risks if the  counterparties  to the  contracts  are unable to meet the terms of
their  contracts.  At June 30, 2005, there were no open forward foreign exchange
contracts.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books and  records  of the Trust are
maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments and
other assets and liabilities  are translated  into U.S.  dollars at the exchange
rates prevailing at the end of the period, and purchases and sales of investment
securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing
on the respective dates of such transactions. Unrealized gains and losses, which
result from changes in foreign exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of
securities,  have  been  included  in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on
investments and foreign  currency  translations.  Net realized  foreign currency
gains and losses  resulting  from  changes in  exchange  rates  include  foreign
currency gains and losses  between trade date and settlement  date on investment
securities  transactions,  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  difference
between the amounts of interest and dividends recorded on the books of the Trust
and the amounts  actually  received.  The portion of foreign  currency gains and
losses  related to  fluctuation in exchange rates between the initial trade date
and  subsequent  sale  trade  date  is  included  in  realized   gain/(loss)  on
investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Trust may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial  information about companies and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

     DIVIDENDS  AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to  common
shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and
capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with Federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from that determined under U.S. generally accepted
accounting  principles.   These  differences  are  primarily  due  to  differing
treatments  of income and gains on  various  investment  securities  held by the
Trust, timing differences and differing  characterizations of distributions made
by the Trust.

     Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Trust's  5.875% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock, Series B Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Stock and Series C
Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred Stock  ("Cumulative  Preferred Stock") are
recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described in Note 5.

     For the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  reclassifications  were  made to
decrease   accumulated  net  investment  income  by  $556,558  and  to  decrease
accumulated  net  realized  loss on  investments,  options and foreign  currency
transactions by $556,558.

     The tax character of distributions  paid during the year ended December 31,
2004 was as follows:

     PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended  (the  "Code").  It is the  Trust's  policy to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

     Dividends  and interest  from  non-U.S.  sources  received by the Trust are
generally subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes at rates ranging up to 30%. Such
withholding  taxes may be reduced or  eliminated  under the terms of  applicable
U.S.  income tax treaties,  and the Trust  intends to undertake  any  procedural
steps required to claim the benefits of such treaties.

     As of December 31, 2004, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

       Net unrealized appreciation on investments ..............  $143,293,748

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Trust has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Trust will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value of the Trust's  average
weekly  net  assets  including  liquidation  value of the  preferred  stock.  In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment  program for the Trust's portfolio and oversees the administration of
all  aspects of the  Trust's  business  and  affairs.  The Adviser has agreed to
reduce  the  management  fee  on  the  incremental  assets  attributable  to the
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock if the total  return of the net asset  value of the
Common Shares of the Trust, including  distributions and advisory fee subject to
reduction,  does not exceed the stated  dividend rate or net swap expense of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

     The Trust's  total  return on the net asset  value of the Common  Shares is
monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the net asset
value of the Common Shares exceeds the stated  dividend rate of each  particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months ended
June 30,  2005,  the Trust's  total  return on the net asset value of the Common
Shares exceeded the stated dividend rate or net swap expense of Series C Auction
Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock. Thus,  management fees were accrued on these
assets. The Trust's total return on the net asset value of the Common Shares did
not exceed  the  stated  dividend  rate or net swap  expense of 5.875%  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock and Series B Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Thus,  management  fees with respect to the  liquidation  value of those
preferred stock assets in the amount of $892,603 were not accrued.

     During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  2005,  Gabelli  &  Company,  Inc.
("Gabelli  &  Company"),  an  affiliate  of the  Adviser,  received  $391,100 in
brokerage  commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio
securities on behalf of the Trust.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)


     The cost of  calculating  the  Trust's net asset value per share is a Trust
expense pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. During the six months ended June 30,
2005, the Trust  reimbursed the Adviser  $22,500 in connection  with the cost of
computing  the Trust's  net asset  value,  which is  included  in  miscellaneous
expenses in the Statement of Operations.

     The Trust is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer in the  amount of  $14,108  for the period of

     The Trust's Declaration of Trust, as amended,  authorize the issuance of an
unlimited number of shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the Common  Shares and  results in the
financial leveraging of the Common Shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative. The Trust is required by the 1940 Act
and by the  Statements of  Preferences to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Trust  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not correct  such  failure,  the Trust may be required to
redeem,  in part or in full,  the  5.875%  Series  A,  Series B  Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock and Series C Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock at a redemption  price of $25,  $25,000,  and $25,000,  respectively,  per
share plus an amount equal to the  accumulated and unpaid  dividends  whether or
not declared on such shares in order to meet these requirements.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)


     Additionally,  failure to meet the foregoing  asset  coverage  requirements
could restrict the Trust's ability to pay dividends to common  shareholders  and
could lead to sales of portfolio  securities at  inopportune  times.  The income
received on the Trust's  assets may vary in a manner  unrelated to the fixed and
variable  rates,  which could have either a beneficial or detrimental  impact on
net investment income and gains available to common shareholders.

     On October 12, 2004, the Trust received net proceeds of $77,255,000  (after
underwriting   discounts  of  $2,520,000  and  estimated  offering  expenses  of
$225,000)  from the  public  offering  of  3,200,000  shares of 5.875%  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  Commencing  October 12, 2009 and thereafter,  the
Trust, at its option, may redeem the 5.875% Series A Cumulative  Preferred Stock
in whole or in part at the redemption  price at any time.  During the six months
ended June 30, 2005,  the Trust did not repurchase any shares of 5.875% Series A
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. At June 30, 2005,  3,200,000  shares of the 5.875%
Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  outstanding  and accrued  dividends
amounted to $52,222.

     On October 12, 2004, the Trust received net proceeds of $217,425,000 (after
underwriting   discounts  of  $2,200,000  and  estimated  offering  expenses  of
$375,000) from the public  offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares
of  Series C  Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock,  respectively.  The
dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is generally held every 7
days, is expected to vary with short-term  interest rates. The dividend rates of
Series B Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock ranged from 2.00% to 3.50%
from  January 1, 2005 through  June 30,  2005.  The  dividend  rates of Series C
Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ranged  from  2.21% to 3.51% from
January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005. Existing shareholders may submit an order
to hold,  bid or sell such shares on each auction  date.  Series B and C Auction
Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  shareholders  may also trade shares in the
secondary  market.  The  Trust,  at its  option,  may  redeem the Series B and C
Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption
price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Trust did not
redeem any shares of Series B and C Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred Stock.
At June 30, 2005,  4,000 and 4,800  shares of the Series B and C Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of
3.50%  and  3.15%  and  accrued  dividends  amounted  to  $19,444  and  $73,500,
respectively.

     The holders of Cumulative  Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the holders of common stock (one vote per share) and will vote together
with  holders of Common  Shares as a single  class.  In  addition,  the 1940 Act
requires that along with approval of a majority of the holders of Common Shares,
approval of a majority of the holders of any  outstanding  shares of  Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  voting separately as a class,  would be required to: (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the Cumulative  Preferred
Stock, and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders,  including,
among other  things,  changes in the Trust's  subclassification  as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

6. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund  shares  trading  practices.  Gabelli  Asset  Management  Inc.,  the
Adviser's  parent  company,  is responding  to these  requests for documents and
testimony.  The Trust does not believe  that these  matters will have a material
adverse  effect  on  the  Trust's  financial  position  or  the  results  of its
operations.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Trust's  maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is
unknown. However, the Trust has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8.  SUBSEQUENT  EVENT.  The  Trust  filed  a  registration  statement  with  the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  for an offering of fixed rate and auction
market preferred stock. The actual amount of capital to be raised,  the dividend
rate(s)  and the timing of the  offering  have not been  determined  and will be
announced  at a later date.  The  proceeds  raised  will be used for  investment
purposes.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It is the Policy of The  Gabelli  Dividend  & Income  Trust  ("Trust")  to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you automatically  become a participant in the Trust's
Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Trust
to issue  shares to  participants  upon an income  dividend  or a capital  gains
distribution  regardless  of whether  the shares are  trading at a discount or a
premium to net asset value. All  distributions to shareholders  whose shares are
registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested  pursuant to the
Plan in additional  shares of the Trust.  Plan participants may send their stock
certificates  to  EquiServe  Trust  Company  ("EquiServe")  to be held in  their
dividend reinvestment account.  Registered shareholders wishing to receive their
distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                       The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
                                  c/o EquiServe
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact EquiServe at (800) 336-6983.

      SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must
do so in  writing  or by  telephone.  Please  submit  your  request to the above
mentioned  address  or  telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,
address  and  account  number.  The  cost  to  liquidate  shares  is  $2.50  per
transaction as well as the brokerage commission incurred.  Brokerage charges are
expected to be less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      If your  shares  are held in the name of a broker,  bank or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in  your  own  name  your  dividends  will  be   automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of Common Shares  distributed  to  participants  in the Plan in
lieu of cash  dividends is determined in the following  manner.  Under the Plan,
whenever  the market price of the Trust's  Common  Shares is equal to or exceeds
net asset value at the time shares are valued for  purposes of  determining  the
number of shares equivalent to the cash dividends or capital gains distribution,
participants are issued Common Shares valued at the greater of (i) the net asset
value as most recently  determined or (ii) 95% of the then current  market price
of the Trust's Common Shares. The valuation date is the dividend or distribution
payment date or, if that date is not a New York Stock Exchange  trading day, the
next  trading  day. If the net asset  value of the Common  Shares at the time of
valuation  exceeds  the market  price of the Common  Shares,  participants  will
receive Common Shares from the Trust valued at market price. If the Trust should
declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable only in cash, EquiServe
will buy Common Shares in the open market,  or on the New York Stock Exchange or
elsewhere,  for the participants' accounts,  except that EquiServe will endeavor
to terminate purchases in the open market and cause the Trust to issue shares at
net asset value if,  following the  commencement of such  purchases,  the market
value of the Common Shares exceeds the then current net asset value.


                                       21

<PAGE>

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

      The Trust  reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or  terminated  by  EquiServe  on at least 90 days'  written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders to increase their  investment in the Trust. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe for  investments in the Trust's shares at
the then  current  market  price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from $250 to
$10,000. EquiServe will use these funds to purchase shares in the open market on
or about the 1st and 15th of each month.  EquiServe will charge each shareholder
who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the  brokerage  commissions.
Brokerage  charges  for such  purchases  are  expected to be less than the usual
brokerage charge for such transactions.  It is suggested that any voluntary cash
payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43010,  Providence,  RI 02940-3010 such
that EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately 10 days before the 1st and
15th of the month.  Funds not received at least five days before the  investment
date shall be held for investment until the next purchase date. A payment may be
withdrawn  without  charge if notice is received by  EquiServe at least 48 hours
before such payment is to be invested.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Trust.
