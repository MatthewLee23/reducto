EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of June 30, 2004
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF JAMES B. HAWKES]

JAMES B. HAWKES
PRESIDENT

Amid an improving economic outlook, Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust, a
closed-end fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EVF,
again provided an attractive yield in a portfolio of senior floating-rate loans.
Based on the Trust's June monthly dividend of $0.035 per share and a closing
share price of $9.46, the Trust's market yield was 4.44% at June 30, 2004.(1)

AS THE ECONOMY STRENGTHENED AND INFLATION REEMERGED, SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES
EDGED HIGHER...

The fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 showed signs of a stronger economy and a
continued improvement in credit climate for corporate borrowers. The Federal
Reserve, which had kept a stable monetary policy throughout the first half of
2004, responded to anecdotal signs of inflation by raising its benchmark Federal
Funds rate to 1.25% from 1.00% on June 30. While short-term rates remained very
low by historical standards, the Fed indicated that it was prepared to raise
rates again to halt any further inflationary momentum.

FLOATING-RATE LOANS POSTED A SOLID PERFORMANCE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR...

With credit quality improving and companies sporting healthier balance sheets,
the loan market turned in a solid performance during the fiscal year. According
to Loan Pricing Corp., new leveraged loan volume rose significantly in the
second quarter of 2004 over the same period a year earlier, boosted, in part, by
increased deal-making, rising merger and acquisition activity and corporate debt
restructurings.

Investor demand was equally strong, as loan investors were attracted to one of
the few income asset classes that could benefit from rising rates. That is,
loans are priced at a credit spread over a floating short-term benchmark,
typically the London-Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Historically, when
short-term rates (LIBOR) have moved higher, shareholders have benefited.

LOAN MARKET VOLATILITY REMAINED RELATIVELY LOW...

The loan market exhibited relatively low volatility during the fiscal year. That
is an important consideration for investors in times of economic or political
uncertainty, and especially in a rising rate environment. Importantly, we
believe a rebounding economy can provide still more income opportunities in
senior floating-rate loans. In the pages that follow, portfolio managers John
Redding, Scott Page and Payson Swaffield discuss the events that impacted the
loan market and the Trust during the past year.


                                               Sincerely,

                                               /s/ James B. Hawkes
                                               James B. Hawkes
                                               President

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of June 30, 2004
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

[PHOTO OF JOHN P. REDDING]

JOHN P. REDDING

AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN P. REDDING, SCOTT H. PAGE AND PAYSON F. SWAFFIELD,
PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST.

Q:   JOHN, THE ECONOMY STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF A SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY IN 2004.
     HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE LOAN MARKET DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A:   MR. REDDING: The loan market has responded well to the economic recovery
     and a continuing improvement in credit quality. With improving business
     conditions, the revenue outlook for many companies has brightened, giving
     many companies the ability to restructure their debt burden and improve
     their balance sheets.

     The more robust economy and emerging signs of inflation have pushed
     interest rates modestly higher. After having held the line on short-term
     rates throughout the first half of the year, the Federal Reserve raised its
     benchmark Federal Funds rate - a key short-term interest rate barometer -
     to 1.25% from 1.00% on June 30. That move represented the first such rate
     hike since May 2000 and could suggest still higher interest rates in the
     months ahead.

     While the loan market's underlying fundamentals have improved, market
     technicals have firmed as well. Investor demand has been very strong, more
     than enough to offset the record increase in supply. The secondary market
     was equally strong, with bid prices on loans slightly above par. While
     strong demand resulted in a slight narrowing of credit spreads, loan yields
     still remained relatively attractive.

SCOTT H. PAGE

Q:   SCOTT, HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?

A:   MR. PAGE: The Trust posted a strongly positive total return during the
     fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. Based on share price, the Trust had a
     total return of 11.59%. On a net asset value basis, the Trust's 8.65%
     return outperformed its benchmark, the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index, which had
     a total return of 7.47%.(1)

     That outperformance was especially noteworthy in light of the fact that the
     Trust was underweighted in the telecom and technology sectors, areas which
     bounced back dramatically in the first half of the fiscal year.

PAYSON F. SWAFFIELD

Q:   PAYSON, WHAT ACCOUNTED FOR INCREASED INVESTOR DEMAND DURING THE FISCAL
     YEAR?

A:   MR. SWAFFIELD: Investors saw an opportunity to benefit from the prospect of
     rising rates. With more robust economic activity and some emerging signs of
     inflation, there was a growing likelihood that the Fed would raise rates,
     as it finally did on June 30.

     Unlike fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate loans have reset provisions, which
     allow interest on the loans to be adjusted in response to changing
     short-term interest rate levels (e.g., LIBOR), usually within 40 to 90
     days. That provision distinguishes floating-rate loans from other
     income-producing asset classes, which typically decline in price as
     interest rates rise.

Q:   WHY DID CREDIT SPREADS NARROW DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A:   MR. REDDING: The Trust's average spread over LIBOR did narrow slightly
     during the period. This trend has been driven primarily by two factors:
     increased investor demand and opportunistic repricings, which stemmed from
     improving business fundamentals. Importantly, despite such repricing
     activity, credit spreads remain attractive relative to our long-term
     experience.

Q:   HOW HAVE YOU POSITIONED THE TRUST IN RECENT MONTHS?

A:   MR. PAGE: We've continued our efforts to diversify the Trust's Senior Loan
     investments on a sector basis. As a result, at June 30, 2004, the Trust had
     investments in 300 issuers representing 49 different industries. The
     Trust's largest sector weightings at June 30 were chemicals, at 8.8% of net
     assets (5.2% of total investments); auto components, at 8.6% (5.1% of total
     investments); real estate, at 8.4% (5.0% of total investments); cable
     television, at 8.1% (4.8% of total investments); and publishing and
     printing, at 7.9% (4.7% of total invstments). That broad sector
     diversification mitigated the risk of a downturn in any single area of the
     economy.

Q:   DID THE TRUST HAVE AN EXPOSURE TO THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY.

A:   MR. SWAFFIELD: Yes. The Trust's investments included companies we believe
     can benefit from an economic recovery. Real estate was one of the largest
     sector weightings, with holdings including companies that manage
     diversified portfolios of retail, apartment and commercial office and
     multi-use properties.

     Auto components was another GDP-sensitive area where the Trust had
     investments. These companies make parts for original equipment
     manufacturers as well as for the aftermarket. Many have global
     manufacturing facilities and serve global markets.

     Chemicals was another investment area that could benefit from increased
     demand. The Trust had investments in manufacturers of commodity-grade
     chemicals that are key ingredients used in plastics, as well as speciality
     chemicals used in household products and pharmaceutical applications.

Q:   WHICH NON-ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS DID THE TRUST EMPHASIZE?

A:   MR. PAGE: Cable television remained a significant investment for the Trust.
     Cable has been an attractive area because of its historically consistent
     revenue stream. The Trust had investments in operators in urban markets, as
     well as rural areas. While subscriber growth rates have slowed in recent
     years, some cable companies have benefited from a restructuring of debt
     that has strengthened their financial underpinnings. In addition, cable
     operators

                                        4
<Page>

     have added revenue-enhancing services such as video-on-demand and Internet
     services, and may soon be positioned to compete for telephone services.

     Other defensive sectors included food and beverages, entertainment, health
     care and drug retailers. These companies included a leading drug chain with
     3,400 stores in 28 states; a nationwide operator of acute care hospitals;
     and an operator of 550 multiplex movie theaters targeting suburbs and
     mid-size markets in 39 states. These segments of the economy have tended to
     have relatively stable revenues and have generally been resistant to
     economic downturns.

Q:   WERE THERE ANY SECTORS WHOSE PERFORMANCE HURT THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE?

A:   MR. REDDING: There were no sectors that specifically hurt the Trust's
     performance. However, as Scott indicated previously, the Trust
     underweighted the technology and telecom sectors. These sectors declined
     sharply during 2002's loan market decline and, not surprisingly, rebounded
     more than the broad market as the economy recovered in 2003 and 2004.
     Currently, we believe these sectors represent a heightened level of risk in
     the event of an economic reversal and have underweighted the Trust's
     exposure to these sectors.

Q:   WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THE TRUST'S USE OF FINANCIAL LEVERAGE DURING THE LAST
     FISCAL YEAR?

A:   MR. SWAFFIELD: At June 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of
     approximately 42% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust uses leverage
     through the issuance of preferred shares and a borrowing program. Use of
     financial leverage creates an opportunity for increased income, but, at the
     same time, creates special risks (including the likelihood of greater
     volatility of net asset value and market price of the common shares).

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of June 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  Significant Accounting Policies

   Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as a
   Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
   Act of 1940 as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
   The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income
   consistent with the preservation of capital, by investing primarily in
   senior, floating rate loans. The following is a summary of significant
   accounting policies consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of
   its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting
   principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for presentation purposes.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- The Trust's investments are primarily in interests
   in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). Certain Senior Loans are deemed
   liquid because reliable market quotations are readily available for them.
   Liquid loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing
   service. Other Senior Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's
   investment adviser, Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under procedures
   established by the Trustees as permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the
   Investment Company Act of 1940. Such procedures include the consideration of
   relevant factors, data and information relating to fair value, including (i)
   the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data relating to the Senior
   Loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate, period until next
   interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate of the Senior Loan, the
   terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any related agreements and the
   position of the loan in the borrower's debt structure; (ii) the nature,
   adequacy and value of the collateral, including the Trust's rights, remedies
   and interests with respect to the collateral; (iii) the creditworthiness of
   the Borrower, based on evaluations of its financial condition, financial
   statements and information about the Borrower's business, cash flows, capital
   structure and future prospects; (iv) information relating to the market for
   the Senior Loan including price quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan
   and interests in similar loans and the market environment and investor
   attitudes towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar loans; (v) the
   experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and
   any intermediate participant in the loan; and (vi) general economic and
   market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Non-loan
   portfolio holdings (other than short-term obligations, but including listed
   issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more pricing
   services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading units
   of such securities using market information, transactions for comparable
   securities and various relationships between securities which are generally
   recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances, portfolio
   securities will be valued at the last sales price on the exchange that is the
   primary market for such securities, or the average of the last quoted bid
   price for those securities for which the over-the-counter market is the
   primary market or for listed securities in which there were no sales during
   the day. Marketable securities listed in the NASDAQ National Market System
   are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. The value of interest rate
   swaps will be based upon a dealer quotation. Short-term obligations which
   mature in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if their original
   term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was 60 days or less or are valued
   at amortized cost using their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if
   their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was more then 60
   days, unless in each case this is determined not to represent fair value.
   Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Other
   portfolio securities for which there are no quotations or valuations are
   valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or on behalf of the
   Trustees.

   B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
   basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
   determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
   premium or discount. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for
   dividends received in cash and/or securities.

   C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
   net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal
   income or excise tax is necessary. At June 30, 2004, the Trust, for federal
   income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $49,875,806, which will
   expire on June 30, 2009 ($1,925,241), June 30, 2010 ($27,557,475), June 30,
   2011 ($13,711,847), and June 30, 2012 ($6,681,243). These amounts will reduce
   the Trust's taxable income arising from future net realized gain on
   investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code and
   thus will reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders which would
   otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trust of any liability for federal
   income or excise tax.

                                       27
<Page>

   Additionally, at June 30, 2004, the Trust had net capital losses of $850,511
   attributable to security transactions incurred after October 31, 2003. These
   are treated as arising on the first day of the Trust's taxable year ending
   June 30, 2005. At June 30, 2004 the undistributed ordinary income on a tax
   basis was $1,295,331 and differed from accumulated net investment income due
   to the different treatment for premium amortization. All distributions in the
   year ended June 30, 2004 were from ordinary income for tax purposes.

   D CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS -- The Portfolio may enter into credit default swap
   contracts for risk management purposes, including diversification. When the
   Portfolio is a buyer of a credit default swap contract, the Portfolio is
   entitled to receive the par (or other agreed-upon) value of a referenced debt
   obligation from the counterparty to the contract in the event of a default by
   a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer, on the debt
   obligation. In return, the Portfolio would pay the counterparty a periodic
   stream of payments over the term of the contract provided that no event of
   default has occurred. If no default occurs, the Portfolio would have spent
   the stream of payments and received no benefit from the contract. When the
   Portfolio is the seller of a credit default swap contract, it receives the
   stream of payments, but is obligated to pay upon default of the referenced
   debt obligations. As the seller, the Portfolio would effectively add leverage
   to its portfolio because, in addition to its total net assets, the Portfolio
   would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap.
   The Portfolio will segregate assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents
   in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swap
   of which it is the seller, marked to market on a daily basis. These
   transactions involve certain risks, including the risk that the seller may be
   unable to fulfill the transaction.

   E EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balances the Trust maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the
   Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses in the
   statement of operations.

   F USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   G INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties of the Trust and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of
   the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters
   into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification
   clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
   this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have
   not yet occurred.

   H OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
   investments are purchased or sold. Gains and losses on securities sold are
   determined on the basis of identified cost.

2  Auction Preferred Shares (APS)

   The Trust issued 2,200 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,200
   shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on June 27, 2001 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as
   a reduction to paid in capital. Dividends on the APS, which accrue daily, are
   paid cumulatively at a rate which was established at the offering of the APS
   and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend rates at
   June 30, 2004 were 1.65% and 1.20% for Series A and Series B Shares,
   respectively. Series A and Series B are identical in all respects except for
   the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust at a redemption price equal
   to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
   payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Trust is in default on its asset maintenance requirements
   with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in
   an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a
   class have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In
   general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting
   rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a
   separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of
   Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus
   accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to maintain certain
   asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the

                                       28
<Page>

   Trust's By-Laws. The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to 0.25% of the
   preferred shares' liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated
   with the preferred auctions.

3  Distributions to Shareholders

   The Trust intends to make monthly distributions to common shareholders of net
   investment income, after payment of any dividends on any outstanding
   preferred shares. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
   Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at
   the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is
   generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on June 30,
   2004 was 1.65% and 1.20%, for Series A and Series B shares, respectively. For
   the year ended June 30, 2004, the Trust paid dividends to Auction Preferred
   shareholders amounting to $635,322 and $621,852 for Series A and Series B
   shares, respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such
   period of 1.14% and 1.12%, respectively.

4  Common Shares of Beneficial Interest

   The Agreement and Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
   unlimited number of full and fractional $0.01 par value common shares of
   beneficial interest. Transactions in common shares were as follows:

5  Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

   The investment adviser fee, computed at a monthly rate of 17/240 of 1% (0.85%
   annually) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by EVM as
   compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the
   Trust. For the year ended June 30, 2004, the fee was equivalent to 0.85%
   (annualized) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets and amounted to
   $4,531,804. Except for Trustees of the Trust who are not members of EVM's
   organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services
   to the Trust out of such investment adviser fee. EVM also serves as the
   administrator of the Trust. An administration fee, computed at the monthly
   rate of 1/48 of 1% (0.25% annually) of the average weekly gross assets of the
   Trust, is paid to EVM for managing and administering business affairs of the
   Trust. For the year ended June 30, 2004, the fee was equivalent to 0.25% of
   the Trust's average weekly gross assets for such period and amounted to
   $1,332,884.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above
   organization.

6  Investment Transactions

   The Trust invests primarily in Senior Loans. The ability of the issuers of
   the Senior Loans held by the Trust to meet their obligations may be affected
   by economic developments in a specific industry. The cost of purchases and
   the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of Senior Loans, corporate
   bonds and equities aggregated $418,336,746 and $418,658,502, respectively,
   for the year ended June 30, 2004.

7  Short-Term Debt and Credit Agreements

   The Trust has entered into a revolving credit agreement that will allow the
   Trust to borrow $120 million to support the issuance of commercial paper and
   to permit the Trust to invest in accordance with its investment practices.
   Interest is charged under the revolving credit agreement at the bank's base
   rate or at an amount above either the bank's adjusted certificate of deposit
   rate or federal funds effective rate. Interest expense includes commercial
   paper program fees of approximately $335,000 and a commitment fee of
   approximately $183,000 which is computed at the annual rate of 0.15% on the
   unused portion of the revolving credit agreement. There were no significant
   borrowings under this agreement during the period. As of June 30, 2004, the
   Trust had commercial paper outstanding of $120,000,000, at an interest rate
   of 1.17% and is reflected in the demand note payable on the Statement of
   Assets and Liabilities. Maximum and average borrowings for the year ended
   June 30, 2004 were $120,000,000 and $109,877,049, respectively, and the
   average interest rate was 1.06%.

8  Financial Instruments

   The Portfolio may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities and to assist in
   managing exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments
   include written options, financial futures contracts and interest rate
   swaps and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment the
   Portfolio has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not

                                       29
<Page>

   necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The
   measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only
   when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

   At June 30, 2004, the Trust had entered into credit default swaps with Credit
   Suisse First Boston dated February 6, 2004 whereby the Trust will receive
   2.45% per year times the notional amount of $3,900,000. The Trust makes
   payment only upon a default event on underlying loan assets (50 in total,
   each representing 2% of the notional value of the swap). At June 30, 2004,
   the Trust had sufficient cash segregated to cover potential obligations
   arising from open swap contracts.

9  Federal Income Tax Basis of Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)

   The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of the
   investment securities at June 30, 2004, as computed on a federal income tax
   basis, were as follows:

<Table>
   <S>                                       <C>
   AGGREGATE COST                            $   530,395,782

   Gross unrealized depreciation                  (1,385,124)
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   NET UNREALIZED APPRECIATION               $     7,737,033
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Unrealized depreciation on swap contracts was $7,429.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of June 30, 2004
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) as
of June 30, 2004, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2004, and the financial highlights
for each of the years in the five-year period ended June 30, 2004. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities and Senior Loans owned at June
30, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian, brokers and selling or agent
banks; where replies were not received from brokers and selling or agent banks,
we performed other auditing procedures. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Senior Income Trust at June 30, 2004, the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets, its cash flows and its financial highlights for the
respective stated periods in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc. at
1-800-331-1710.

</Table>

(1)    Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
       related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
       audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
       audit fees.
(2)    Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services
       rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax
       advice, and tax planning.

<Page>

(3)    All other fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for products and
       services provided by the principal accountant other than audit,
       audit-related, and tax services.

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its
pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies
(i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services
determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate
specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies,
it must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services
pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrant's audit
committee at least annually. The registrant's audit committee maintains full
responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of
the registrant's principal accountant.

(e)(2) No services described in paragraphs (b)-(d) above were approved by the
registrant's audit committee pursuant to the "de minimis exception" set forth in
Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) The following table presents (i) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees
for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed for services rendered to the
registrant by its principal accountant for the registrant's last two fiscal
years; and (ii) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax,
and other services) billed for services rendered to the Eaton Vance organization
for the registrant's last two fiscal years.

EATON VANCE(1)                                           $ 402,045     $ 287,437
</Table>

(1) Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the
registrant's investment adviser and administrator.

(h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether the provision by the
registrant's principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Norton H. Reamer (Chair), Samuel L. Hayes, III, William H.
Park and Lynn A. Stout are the members of the registrant's audit committee.

Please see schedule of investments contained in the Report to Stockholders
included under Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

ITEM 8. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not Applicable.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

I, James B. Hawkes certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Eaton Vance Senior Income
Trust;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and cash

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and
have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  [omitted];

     (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date within 90
days prior to the filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of
an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial information; and

<Page>

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
