FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:                                               FEBRUARY 2005

Two thousand four was a comparatively quiet year for domestic equity markets,
with generally positive returns for growth stock investors. Equity investors
remember all too well the roaring market of the late 1990s, the bear market of
2000-2002 and the strong rebound of 2003. In that light, a less volatile,
relatively uneventful year may have been a welcome respite.

     The table that follows demonstrates that the Fund moderately outperformed
large cap growth stocks in 2004. However, it lagged the strong performance
posted by small and mid-cap growth stocks. Much of the reason for the
underperformance relative to small and mid-cap stocks can be traced to better
returns from lower quality, high beta stocks, a point we will discuss further
momentarily.

     Returning to 2004, it was a year of few surprises, and for every bit of
good news there seemed to be an offsetting negative. The presidential election
in effect neutralized the stock market for three quarters, leaving the S&P 500
Index just about flat through nine months (+1.5 percent through September 30).
Another newsworthy item was the Federal Reserve reversing its highly
accommodative monetary policy by hiking its target Fed funds rate five times
beginning in June, raising that key short-term rate from 1.0 percent to 2.25
percent. Those hikes have had relatively little impact on financial markets, as
the Fed had been carefully telegraphing its intentions so as not to catch
investors off guard. The dollar has fallen--thus far in an orderly manner,
mitigating the potential for a sharp sell-off in dollar denominated assets.

     Higher cost oil extracted its measure of pain--a barrel of crude moving
close to $56 in October--but inflation, while at its highest since 2000,
remained quiescent (+3.3 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index). In
addition, key economic indicators suggest continued growth in consumer and
corporate spending. Iraq remains a painful reminder of the world that we live
in, but terrorist actions--except for events such as the tragic bombings in
Spain and Russia--were muted.

CORPORATE EARNINGS REMAIN STRONG

On the corporate front, earnings topped out in the first quarter, but to an
extent that was to be expected after the unsustainably strong recovery in 2003.
By the time fourth quarter figures are tallied, earnings should be up about 20
percent for the year. The energy, utility and telecom sectors were the best
performers among the 10 sectors that make up the S&P 500 Index, while the
sectors that lagged were health care, information technology and consumer
staples.

     A look beneath the surface reveals a few key points about the Fund
vis-a-vis overall market performance in recent years. First, it has been a
difficult period for growth stock investors in general. In 2004, value topped
growth by a good margin in all three capitalization ranges--large, mid- and
small cap. Looking back, during the very strong bull market of the second half
of the 1990s, growth stocks consistently outperformed value stocks. Since 2000,
the trend has largely been reversed--in fact, value has outperformed growth for
the fifth straight year. Today, some investors consider value stocks to be as
fully valued as growth stocks were in the latter '90s. I am not going to predict
an imminent turnaround and a resumption of leadership by growth stocks, but such
a reversion to the mean is overdue, on an historic basis. As well, the Fund's
three growth managers express some feelings on this topic in our annual Manager
Roundtable, which begins on page 11.

LOWER QUALITY STOCKS OUTPERFORM

Another point that needs to be made concerns the issue of quality. Lower quality
stocks have generally been outperforming high quality ones. This was to be
expected in last year's recovery, as rapidly improving economic conditions
considerably reduced the high-risk premiums commanded by low quality companies
during the last recession. The highly accommodative monetary policy provided by
the Federal Reserve not only pushed short-term interest rates to 40-year lows,
but also collapsed yield spreads for low quality borrowers. This allowed highly
leveraged companies to access the credit markets, affording them a good deal
more financial flexibility. What is a little curious is that lower quality
stocks outperformed through the first three quarters of 2004, even as the
Federal Reserve began raising short-term rates, signaling a move away from its
highly accommodative monetary stance. There were signs during the fourth quarter
that investors were beginning to focus more on earnings quality and
sustainability. We would not be surprised if that trend were to continue, given
the backdrop of slower profit growth coupled with an environment of tighter
liquidity.

     Further, it is worth pointing out that the Fund's investment managers are
going to maintain their quality orientation and not try to chase performance.
How did that impact 2004? Last year, stocks from certain sectors that are not
traditional

growth areas led the market. Energy and industrials are prime examples. Stocks
from these sectors, although not a large component of the growth indices, were
sizable contributors to return. On the other hand, traditional growth
industries--such as information technology and health care--lagged in 2004. Our
belief is that a better environment for growth stocks in general and quality
growth stocks in particular will benefit the Fund. On the longer term, the Fund
ranks in the top one-third of the Lipper Multi-Cap Growth Mutual Fund universe
over the past five years. Our goal will be to return the Fund's short-term
performance to such a level.

     As we look ahead, we believe the Fund's basic structure--a closed-end,
multi-managed Fund providing shareholders with access to institutional quality
investment managers and exposure to the full capitalization spectrum of high
quality growth stocks--will serve investors well. Likewise, management and
ongoing monitoring by the Fund manager, Liberty Asset Management Company
(LAMCO), ensure alignment with shareholder interests and that the investment
managers are meeting expectations. A fuller description of the Fund's unique
attributes may be found in this Annual Report's feature section, which
immediately follows this letter. I encourage you to review it.

     In summary, we believe the Fund is well positioned to benefit from its high
quality orientation and the managers' adherence to their investment disciplines
and processes. We have been through a period that is anomalous in the long
history of the stock market, and a return to traditional quality growth stock
leadership should prove rewarding.

     We at LAMCO pledge to continue our best efforts on behalf of Fund
shareholders. Indeed, managing with our shareholders' best interests first and
foremost is what we do every day. As always, we thank you for your ongoing
support of the Fund.


Sincerely,

/s/ William R. Parmentier

FUND FUNDAMENTALS

[GRAPHIC]

Multiple Managers

Large institutional investors--pension funds, endowments and foundations, for
example--employ multiple portfolio managers to make investment decisions. These
large investors establish investment policy and objectives and then retain
well-qualified investment managers to implement the policy according to their
guidelines.

     Liberty All-Star Growth Fund is managed in much the same way. The Fund's
advisor, Liberty Asset Management Company (LAMCO), allocates the Fund's assets
among three growth stock managers. Growth managers concentrate on companies with
high expected sales and earnings growth that are often leaders in expanding
sectors of the economy. Why three managers practicing the same style? Because
even within the growth style performance can vary by capitalization. Liberty
All-Star Growth Fund provides investors with exposure to all three
capitalization ranges: small cap, mid-cap and large cap. This diversifies the
portfolio and can dampen the higher volatility that comes with having a single
growth manager.

AS ADVISOR TO THE ALL-STAR GROWTH FUND, LIBERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY (LAMCO)
ADDS VALUE FOR INVESTORS BY PRACTICING A WELL-DEFINED AND DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT PROCESS. LAMCO BRINGS OBJECTIVITY, EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO
CONSTRUCTING AND MONITORING A MULTI-MANAGED PORTFOLIO, AND IS DEDICATED TO THE
LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF FUND SHAREHOLDERS.

Exchange Traded

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund is a closed-end investment company with a fixed
number of shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and on other
exchanges. By contrast, open-end mutual funds create and redeem shares
continuously as money flows into or out of the fund and are not traded on stock
exchanges.

     In recent years, closed-end, exchange-traded funds have become increasingly
popular because they offer several advantages to investors. Taking Liberty
All-Star Growth Fund as an example, Fund shares are bought and sold just like
shares of other publicly traded companies. The price of a share is determined by
supply and demand and pricing is continuous--not just end-of-day, as is the case
with open-end funds. Fund shares trade frequently, there are no annual sales
fees and expense ratios are often lower than many open-end funds. While many
exchange-traded funds are passive investments whose return is based on the
performance of an index, Liberty All-Star Growth Fund is actively managed by its
three investment managers. From their perspective, the Fund's closed-end
structure is advantageous because they have the confidence of knowing they will
not experience sharp inflows or outflows of assets and thus are able to focus on
the long-term investment merits of their portfolio.

Alignment and Objectivity

Alignment with shareholders' best interests and objective decision-making are
two fundamental principles to which LAMCO, the Fund's advisor, is dedicated. A
constant focus on these two standards helps to ensure that all the myriad
decisions involved in the management of the Fund are made openly and equitably.
The Fund's sole goal is better and more consistent long-term total returns for
its shareholders, which LAMCO pursues by constructing a diversified line-up of
growth style managers who practice varying strategies and focus on stocks in
different capitalization ranges.

     A series of checks and balances ensures the integrity of that goal. There
are no in-house loyalties or external alliances to stand in the way. The Fund is
governed by an independent Board of Directors that is elected by and responsible
to the shareholders. The Fund's three investment managers are retained by the
Fund, but make independent buy and sell decisions. They know, however, that
LAMCO monitors their performance and adherence to their growth style of
investing and will replace them if such action is warranted. In addition, the
LAMCO officers involved in day-to-day management of the Fund are incented to act
in investors' best interests because they too are shareholders and a portion of
their compensation is tied to Fund performance.

Institutional Quality

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund is intended to bring institutional quality
investing to individual investors. Multi-management is one strategy large
institutions use to manage their portfolios that the Fund brings to individual
investors. There are several others, however.

     One is manager quality. All-stars are proven performers in their field...a
select group that stands apart. Since assuming complete management of the Fund
in November 1995, LAMCO has sought investment managers who meet its rigorous
criteria. LAMCO selects investment management firms for the Fund after an
extensive review of their background and track record, including the firm's
investment philosophy, process, people and performance. As investors in any type
of fund have learned, manager selection is perhaps the critical decision. The
managers LAMCO retains for the Fund principally serve institutional clients and
are generally not accessible to individual investors. The Fund's institutional
size and professional reputation can provide shareholders with access to these
leading managers.

     LAMCO overlays another level of quality. There are thousands of investment
management firms from which to choose, and their long-term investment
performance varies widely. In researching and retaining managers, LAMCO calls on
the expertise of its professional staff, state-of-the-art analytical tools and
years of experience in the investment field. Similarly, LAMCO's continuous
monitoring ensures that the managers meet expectations.

Monitoring and Rebalancing

Two significant phases of ongoing Fund management are monitoring and
rebalancing. These are disciplines that individual investors should
practice--but often don't, owing to a lack of time or expertise. LAMCO adds
value for Fund shareholders by performing both.

     Monitoring is a continuous process in which LAMCO routinely reviews the
investment managers. Constant vigilance is required to ensure that each
portfolio manager is performing as expected. Investment returns are closely
watched, but are not the only factor that is monitored. Firm ownership and key
personnel can change, for example, introducing new decision-makers. Market
pressures may lead a manager to deviate from its espoused growth strategy.
LAMCO's active monitoring guards against these possibilities. We analyze the
Fund's investment managers' trading activity and the characteristics of their
portfolio holdings to confirm that they are adhering to their strategy and
performing well compared to their peers.

     Periodic rebalancing maintains the Fund's structural integrity and is a
well- recognized investment discipline. Owing to shifting market sentiment and
their differing styles and strategies, the investment managers will perform
differently over time. This can unbalance the intended composition of the Fund's
investment portfolio. When this happens, LAMCO "locks in" profits by taking
assets from the outperforming managers and giving them to those whose strategy
and capitalization focus have temporarily lagged. While this seems
counterintuitive, it is really a case of taking money from today's winners and
redeploying it among tomorrow's.

Quarterly Distributions

Since 1997, the Fund has followed a policy of paying annual distributions on its
common stock at a rate of 10 percent of the Fund's net asset value (paid
quarterly at 2.5 percent per quarter), providing a systematic mechanism for
distributing funds to shareholders.

     Because a portion of the portfolio is turned over when an investment
manager is replaced (often generating realized capital gains), the Fund's
multi-management investment approach and the payout policy complement one
another.

     Recognizing the diverse needs of the Fund's shareholders, the Fund also
offers an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Some investors
prefer their dividends in the form of cash. Others reinvest their dividends in
additional Fund shares, thus letting their dividends compound over time. The
Cash Purchase feature allows shareholders to make additional investments in the
Fund on a monthly basis. The Fund rounds out its services for shareholders by
providing a range of tools, such as a Web site at www.all-starfunds.com;
communications, such as monthly updates and quarterly reports; and investor
assistance via toll-free telephone at 1-800-LIB-FUND.

THE FUND'S MANAGERS LOOK AT 2004 AND 2005, AS WELL AS AT LONGER-TERM TRENDS
INFLUENCING STOCKS BY STYLE AND CAPITALIZATION

THOUGH NOT AS STRONG AS 2003, 2004 TURNED OUT TO BE A SATISFACTORY YEAR, THANKS
TO A STRONG FOURTH QUARTER. ONCE AGAIN, THE MANAGERS REMAINED TRUE TO THEIR
INVESTMENT DISCIPLINES --UNSWAYED BY THE SURPRISING ABILITY OF LOWER QUALITY
STOCKS TO POST HIGHER RETURNS THAN HIGHER QUALITY ISSUES. HERE, THEY DISCUSS
2004 AND 2005, AS WELL AS LONGER-TERM TRENDS, AND IDENTIFY A STOCK THEY LIKE FOR
THE YEAR AHEAD.

Continuing an annual tradition, the Fund's manager, Liberty Asset Management
Company (LAMCO), recently had the opportunity to moderate a roundtable with the
Fund's three investment managers. As would be expected, there is commonality to
the managers' comments because they are all growth style investors. However, in
reading this roundtable, Fund shareholders should make note of differences, as
well--for example, the managers' comments about the 2004 performance advantage
of small and mid-cap growth stocks over large cap growth stocks. As well, the
managers look at a longer-term trend of great interest to growth investors,
namely five years of outperformance by value stocks and factors that may change
it. The participating investment managers and their investment styles are:

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS INTERVIEW REPRESENT THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' VIEWS AT
THE TIME OF THE DISCUSSION (JANUARY 2005) AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

M. A. WEATHERBIE & CO., INC.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/Matthew A. Weatherbie, CFA,
President and Founder
INVESTMENT STYLE/Small-Cap Growth - M.A. Weatherbie practices a small
capitalization growth investment style focusing on high quality companies that
demonstrate superior earnings growth prospects, yet are reasonably priced
relative to their intrinsic value. The firm seeks to provide superior returns
relative to small capitalization growth indices over a full market cycle.

TCW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/Douglas S. Foreman, CFA,
Chief Investment Officer U.S. Equities
INVESTMENT STYLE/Mid-Cap Growth - TCW seeks capital appreciation through
investment in the securities of rapidly growing companies whose business
prospects, in TCW's view, are not properly perceived by consensus research.

WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY, L.L.C.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/John G. Jostrand, CFA, Principal
INVESTMENT STYLE/Large-Cap Growth - William Blair emphasizes disciplined,
fundamental research to identify quality growth companies with the ability to
sustain their growth over long time periods. At the core of the firm is a group
of analysts, who perform research aimed at identifying companies that have the
opportunity to grow in a sustainable fashion for extended periods of time.

"TWO THOUSAND FOUR...WAS AN ODD YEAR IN THAT THE FIRST QUARTER WAS
SPECULATIVE... THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR WAS MARKED BY ANXIETY...AND THE FOURTH
QUARTER AGAIN WAS SOMEWHAT SPECULATIVE IN OUR VIEW."

MATT WEATHERBIE,
M.A. WEATHERBIE

LAMCO: Having all the managers in a roundtable is an excellent opportunity for
Fund shareholders to compare the varying growth investment approaches that are
present in the Fund. Thus, we'd like to open by asking each of you to summarize
your investment philosophy and approach. Let's go by capitalization size, from
small to large. That means starting off with you, Matt Weatherbie.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH):
We are growth stock investors: We seek to invest in the best smaller
capitalization growth companies

                                       11
<Page>

in America. This means companies with some seasoning, a significant competitive
advantage, high inherent profitability, financial strength and proven
entrepreneurial management. Our process is bottom-up and emphasizes both
detailed financial analysis and field research to assess the quality of a
company's business model and management. We use a disciplined, proven set of
stock valuation techniques to determine good investment value.

LAMCO: Doug Foreman, summarize your approach, will you please?

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): We're aggressive growth investors. We're looking
for companies with the potential for positive earnings surprise and that have
outstanding business models. Those are our two key criteria. We believe that a
stock is only truly mispriced in the marketplace if the Wall Street consensus
has expectations in terms of growth rate and earnings per share (EPS) that are
below our own. That gap between what our estimates are based on our fundamental
work and what Wall Street expects and will pay for is our alpha, or our ability
to consistently outperform. Overall, our batting average for finding companies
that have sound business models is pretty high, which means the growth these
companies are generating is sustainable and capable of beating expectations.

LAMCO: John Jostrand, tell us about the William Blair large cap growth approach.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): William Blair employs a quality
growth approach and a bottom-up fundamental research process. We define a
quality growth company as one exhibiting superior, long-term earnings growth
combined with a proven and sustainable competitive advantage from a market/brand
position, proprietary product or technology position, or a unique asset base.
These companies generally exhibit superior profitability, high reinvestment
rate, low financial leverage, consistency of returns and strong management. We
have a team of experienced analysts, who are organized into sector teams and led
by a portfolio manager.

LAMCO: That's a great start. Let's turn to the year just past. As we look back,
2004 was one of those years in which consensus estimates among investment
managers appear to have played out in reality--that is, for steady, but moderate
gains in the 6 percent range for large cap growth indices such as the Russell
1000 Growth, with small and mid-cap growth stocks providing better returns in
the 10 to 12 percent range. How do you assess the year from the perspective of
your own style and strategy? John Jostrand, let's ask you to lead off.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): Our style had to sail through a
headwind over the past couple of years. Quality stocks entered one of the
periodic "out of favor" stages during 2003 and the first half of 2004, as did
large capitalization companies. The low interest rate environment, along with
investors shifting to a more speculative level, contributed to higher beta
stocks' outperformance during the early stage of the market rebound.

"TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS A YEAR OF GOOD ECONOMIC PROGRESS IMPEDED SLIGHTLY BY
MACRO EVENTS...MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL GOING FROM
AROUND $30 TO NEARLY $56 IN OCTOBER..."

DOUG FOREMAN,
TCW

     In 2004, Standard and Poor's earnings posted 19.2 percent growth from the
previous year. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan followed through on his
pledge to get short rates up, and we believe him when he says he will do it
again. Rising rates are usually coupled with slower rates of growth in earnings
as competition for capital becomes keener. We are expecting that short-term
interest rates--such as the Fed funds rate and Treasury bills--will continue to
rise, placing pressure on the lower quality, more highly leveraged companies.
During a more normal economic environment, quality companies should return to a
premium valuation because of their quality characteristics.

LAMCO: Let's go to the opposite end of the capitalization range and hear from
our small cap manager.

                                       12
<Page>

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): Two thousand four ended with us
being reasonably satisfied with low double-digit returns from our strategy.
However, it was an odd year in that the first quarter was speculative due to the
prior unprecedented reduction in short-term interest rates by the Federal
Reserve while the middle of the year was marked by anxiety about the war in Iraq
and the upcoming presidential election. The fourth quarter again was somewhat
speculative in our view. Overall, the solid 22 percent earnings growth from
companies in our portfolio drove our returns.

LAMCO: Doug Foreman, as the Fund's mid-cap manager you're "in the middle."
What's your assessment of 2004?

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): Two thousand four was a year of good economic
progress impeded slightly by macro events, such as the war in Iraq, five
increases in short-term interest rates by the Fed, the uncertainty of the
presidential election and, most importantly, the price of a barrel of crude oil
going from around $30 to nearly $56 in October before settling back a little. In
a nutshell, all of those factors created doubt in investors' minds until
October, November and December, when we saw some terrific returns. Investors
once again focused on earnings, and concluded they were pretty good. Because of
the uncertainty, a lot of investors focused on dividends last year, and as a
result value stocks--such as utilities, energy companies and real estate
investment trusts--outperformed growth stocks across the capitalization
spectrum. By contrast, technology, biotech and other growth sectors are valued
more on pure growth and they didn't do as well last year.

LAMCO: Interesting perspectives about lower quality being in favor, along with
market leadership from unusual quarters of the market. Two thousand five may be
shaping up as 2004's opposite, in that there is little consensus among
investors. The bulls and bears can both make compelling cases. Recognizing that
the Fund's managers primarily take a bottom-up approach, what are your overall
thoughts about '05? Doug, let's stay with you.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): Mid-cap growth should be well positioned for
2005. Growth wasn't the leader in 2004 and there isn't any undue speculation
occurring in the growth area. To the extent there's any euphoria in the stock
market, I think it's centered in the value area, as I just mentioned. So, I
think mid-cap growth is quite well positioned for good return. I'm particularly
optimistic about the semiconductor area in 2005 after the inventory buildup that
occurred in 2004. That has been corrected to a large extent and I think the
outlook there is good. I don't expect corporate profits to be quite as robust,
but they should be OK. As to interest rates, I think the Fed will continue to
raise short-term rates to 3.5 percent or so, maybe a little more. But I think
that's already been factored into investors' outlooks.

"QUALITY STOCKS ENTERED ONE OF THE PERIODIC 'OUT OF FAVOR' STAGES DURING 2003
AND THE FIRST HALF OF 2004, AS DID LARGE CAPITALIZATION COMPANIES."

JOHN JOSTRAND,
WILLIAM BLAIR

LAMCO: How do you view 2005 from the small cap perspective, Matt Weatherbie?

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): We are bottom-up investors and
will make no change in our philosophy and process for 2005. In my opinion,
however, the once-in-a-generation era of extremely low short-term interest rates
is ending. The economy is back on solid footing and the Fed has been tightening
by 25 basis points at every meeting beginning in June 2004. It likely won't stop
until rates are at a more neutral level of 3.0 to 3.5 percent. We believe this
may well dampen speculation and "carry trade" investing and cause investors to
increasingly seek out superior businesses with organic revenue and earnings per
share growth.

LAMCO: John Jostrand, how do you see things unfolding?

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): Overall, valuations are OK. The S&P
500 Index is trading

                                       13
<Page>

under 17 times 2005 forecast earnings, while inflation is at a moderate level.
We feel that earnings growth will be in the 8 to 10 percent range. At that rate,
companies are trading at a fair rate of 17 times forecast earnings, and we
expect the market to expand with earnings growth.

LAMCO: What are the one or two macro factors--for example, interest rates,
energy costs, raw materials/commodities, geopolitical tensions or corporate
earnings--that you believe investors should watch in '05 as positive or negative
influences insofar as stock market performance is concerned? Let's take that one
in capitalization order, large to small.

"I BELIEVE A STOCK MARKET ENVIRONMENT WITH SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES ONCE AGAIN
IN MORE NEUTRAL TERRITORY WILL ALLOW LEADERSHIP TO ROTATE TO GROWTH ONCE AGAIN."

MATT WEATHERBIE,
M.A. WEATHERBIE

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): In our opinion, the key issue to
watch will be the interest rate environment. We're not so much looking at the
short end--as we expect the Federal Reserve to continue raising rates--but more
at the 10-year. Lower interest rates have allowed the consumer to support the
post-bubble economy. Businesses took advantage of the lower rates to shore up
balance sheets. More recently, they have begun to increase their capital
spending. The duration of the economic recovery may depend solely on business
spending if a rise in long-term rates dampens the consumer.

     As for commodity price increases, we feel that the combination of continued
productivity and global sourcing should offset the inflationary pressures from
the commodity or materials sector. With moderate inflation in place, we are
optimistic that rates will not increase to the point of suffocating the
expansion.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): For growth to do better, we need less
uncertainty regarding the macro factors that restrained the market in 2004 and
we need energy prices to stay reasonably moderate. If we see oil in the $40 per
barrel range a lot of the money that has been plowed into the energy sector will
plow back out, and it will have to go somewhere else.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): I believe investors should
watch interest rates and corporate earnings among macro factors insofar as stock
market performance is concerned. Consensus expectations are for slowing but
still positive earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies--perhaps up 7 to 9
percent in 2005--and for short rates to rise to perhaps 3.5 percent, but for
long rates not to increase much at all. Positive or negative surprises relative
to these expectations will affect the market's performance.

LAMCO: One of the more intriguing trends of recent years has been growth versus
value. Growth reigned supreme in the late '90s, while value has been the story
in the early 2000s. Growth lagged value in 2004 for all three capitalization
ranges (small, mid- and large) and the same is true for longer periods (3-, 5-
and 10-year periods, using the Russell indices as the measure). Reflecting your
own capitalization focus for the All-Star Growth Fund in your answer, why has
growth lagged in recent years? And, what has to happen for market leadership to
rotate to growth once again? Let's go in reverse order, small to large.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): One reason growth may have
lagged value is that when the Federal Reserve reduces short-term interest rates
to 1 percent and keeps them there for 12 months, it is relatively easy for banks
as well as companies with high-cost debt to show good earnings growth. Such
companies tend to be in value universes. I believe a stock market environment
with short-term interest rates once again in more neutral territory will allow
leadership to rotate to growth once again.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): The fundamentals of areas such as real estate,
energy and financials

                                       14
<Page>

have been very strong over the last several years. Increases in housing and
energy prices have provided for significant increases in cash flow for these
industries, which have been concentrated in the value indices. Once crude and
housing price gains moderate or decline slightly, we should see investor
interest rotate back toward more traditional growth areas such as health care
and technology.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): With 2004's outperformance of value
once again, the 10-year returns on the value indices are now greater than their
growth counterparts. At the end of the '90s, growth indices were on top. Many of
the sectors in the value index spent years out of favor. Energy companies, a
much larger component in value indices, were out of favor for decades. With a
tightening of supplies and growing global demand from China and India, energy
companies' earnings increased. Another large component of value indices is
retail banks. With the steep interest rate curve along with no major bank
crisis, banks were in an ideal environment. The contrary is true for the
companies that compile the bulk of the growth indices. Technology, the largest
sector in the growth indices, suffered many years of excess inventory and slack
demand. Health care, primarily large pharmaceuticals, after having many years of
new billion-dollar drug patents, were faced with a new product drought. The
fundamental changes in different industries' growth prospects is changing, and
companies that once resided in a Russell growth index are migrating to value and
vice versa. While this drifting takes place, intuitively it makes sense that
valuations will be similar for the different styles. Historically, growth
companies' higher quality characteristics have traded at a premium to value
companies. That may not be entirely the case this time around as the ground
shifts. However, the outperformance by value companies has now brought their
valuations in-line with their growth counterparts and we feel that the rotation
has largely been completed.

"I THINK THE FED WILL CONTINUE TO RAISE SHORT-TERM RATES TO 3.5 PERCENT OR SO,
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. BUT I THINK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN FACTORED INTO INVESTORS'
OUTLOOKS."

DOUG FOREMAN,
TCW

LAMCO: Thoughtful answers, all. The other trend, of course, has been
outperformance by small and mid-cap stocks over large cap stocks. Again
reflecting your own capitalization range, do you see this continuing, or is a
reversal afoot?

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): There was an enormous interest in
large companies during the '90s that has been corrected over the past five
years. The increasingly competitive landscape should bode well for larger
capitalization companies that have the deep pockets to compete effectively.
Capital will become scarcer with an increased risk posture brought about by a
maturing economic cycle and a tighter monetary environment.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): I believe small and medium sized stocks will
continue to modestly outperform large cap stocks in 2005, but not by a wide
margin. Corporate profit growth is likely to be positive in 2005 but decelerate
year-over-year. Earnings from many small to medium sized companies should grow
faster than the average large cap company and, therefore, outperform. Overall
economic growth should be favorable, which should provide a favorable backdrop
for smaller businesses.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): I believe that small cap growth
can continue to outperform. Companies in the S&P 500 are only projected to grow
earnings about 7 to 9 percent over the next two years, so these companies are
already at a growth disadvantage compared to our smaller cap growth companies,
which are growing in excess of 20 percent. In addition, the recent problems at
Merck, Pfizer, Marsh & McLennan, Fannie Mae and AIG, among others, highlight to
investors that complex business models and opaque accounting can make the
largest companies inherently more difficult to analyze independently.

                                       15
<Page>

LAMCO: Let's conclude as we did last year when we asked you to name a stock that
you added recently to the portion of the All-Star Growth Fund portfolio that you
manage and why you added it. Doug Foreman, let's ask our mid-cap manager to lead
off.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): We believe Opsware could be positioned for a
breakout year. Opsware is the leading provider of data center automation
software for corporations and government. It helps large corporations better
manage their servers and networks, and it allows them to reduce their IT staffs
and/or put their IT employees to work on higher value strategic projects. It's a
solution whose time has come in the corporate enterprise environment, and
corporate IT spending should be picking up after a few soft years. Marc
Andreessen, who was a founder of Netscape, is the CEO, so there is great
leadership and experience at the helm.

"...THE OUTPERFORMANCE BY VALUE COMPANIES HAS NOW BROUGHT THEIR VALUATIONS
IN-LINE WITH THEIR GROWTH COUNTERPARTS AND WE FEEL THAT THE ROTATION HAS LARGELY
BEEN COMPLETED."

JOHN JOSTRAND,
WILLIAM BLAIR

LAMCO: Matt Weatherbie, tell us about a small cap growth stock that you like.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): We recently added Thor
Industries to our portfolio. Thor is the largest, fastest growing, most
profitable (22 percent return on equity) manufacturer of recreational vehicles
with a 25 percent share of the overall industry--twice the market share of the
next largest competitor. The company's brand names include Airstream, Keystone
and Dutchman. Industry conditions are favorable and Thor has important
competitive advantages, including buying leverage, state-of-the-art engineering,
a very entrepreneurial organization and a debt-free balance sheet.

LAMCO: John Jostrand, wrap it up for us, please.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): Caremark, the pharmacy benefit
management company (PBM) that designs and administers pharmaceutical services,
would be our 2005 pick. The company distributes medications to eligible
participants in various health benefit plans. Within the PBM landscape, there is
a high fixed cost structure, which means larger companies have better leverage
and competitive advantage. Caremark should gain synergistic benefits as a result
of its recent acquisition of Advanced PCS. With Advanced PCS, Caremark is now
close to the largest PBM in the market. Caremark announced a business coup
through the signing of the industry's largest contract, the Federal Employee
Plan mail order. The increased volume shifts significant competitive power
towards Caremark and allows management to be more selective with future
contracts. Other potential growth opportunities should arise with the new pharma
benefit for seniors coming online in the next year.

LAMCO: Thanks to All.

The dark green region of the graph above reflects the growth of the investment
assuming all distributions were received in cash and not reinvested back in the
Fund. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $15,751 (this
value includes distributions per share totaling $7.96 during the period).

    The light green region of the graph depicts additional value realized
through reinvestment of all distributions and participation in all the rights
offerings under the terms of each offering. On three occasions, the Fund has
conducted rights offerings that allow shareholders to purchase additional shares
at a discount. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to
$17,741.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc.'s current policy, in effect since 1997, is to
pay distributions on its shares totaling approximately 10 percent of its net
asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2.5 percent of
the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the
Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date. THE FIXED DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT
RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE FUND'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME OR NET REALIZED
CAPITAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND MAY BE TAXED AS ORDINARY INCOME UP TO THE AMOUNT OF
THE FUND'S CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS. If, for any calendar
year, the total distributions made under the 10 percent pay-out policy exceed
the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will
generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the
shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares. If the Fund's net investment
income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount distributed
under the 10 percent pay-out policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and
not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the
extent of such excess.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2004

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a Maryland corporation
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended, as
a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.

FUND SHARES

The Fund may issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 par.

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Equity securities are valued at the last sale price at the close of the
principal exchange on which they trade. Unlisted securities or listed securities
for which there were no sales during the day are valued at the closing bid price
on such exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

     Short-term debt obligations maturing in more than 60 days for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at current market value. Short-term
debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

     Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are
valued at fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied
procedures approved by and under the general supervision of the Board of
Directors.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with institutions that
the Fund's investment advisor has determined are creditworthy. The Fund, through
its custodian, receives delivery of underlying securities collateralizing a
repurchase agreement. Collateral is at least equal, at all times, to the value
of the repurchase obligation including interest. A repurchase agreement
transaction involves certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the
counterparty. These risks include possible delays or restrictions upon the
Fund's ability to dispose of the underlying securities and a possible decline in
the value of the underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to
assert its rights.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Corporate actions and dividend
income are recorded on the ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

Consistent with the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable income to shareholders, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund currently has a policy of paying distributions on its common shares
totaling approximately 10% of its net asset value per year. The distributions
are payable in four quarterly distributions of 2.5% of the Fund's net asset
value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday prior to each
quarterly declaration date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on
ex-date.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
Reclassifications are made to the Fund's capital accounts for permanent tax
differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

     For the year ended December 31, 2004, permanent book and tax basis
differences resulting primarily from differing treatments for net operating
losses and excess distributions were identified and reclassified among the
components of the Fund's net assets as follows:

                                       32

Net investment loss and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003 was as follows:

As of December 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

           $ --                     $ --          $  25,845,436
</Table>

*  The differences between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized appreciation
   are primarily due to deferral of losses from wash sales.

The following capital loss carryforwards, are available to reduce taxable income
arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the extent
permitted by the Internal Revenue Code:

<Table>
<Caption>
       YEAR OF         CAPITAL LOSS

        2010           $  8,256,606
</Table>

Future realized gains offset by the loss carryforwards are not required to be
distributed to shareholders. However, under the Fund's distribution policy, as
described above, such gains may be distributed to shareholders in the year gains
are realized. Any gains distributed may be taxable to shareholders as ordinary
income. Capital loss carryforwards of $8,767,776 were utilized during the year
ended December 31, 2004.

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

Liberty Asset Management Company ("LAMCO"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor of the Fund.
Prior to April 1, 2004, LAMCO was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Fund's investment advisor, was acquired by BOA. The
acquisition did not change the way the Fund is managed, the investment personnel
assigned to manage the Fund or the fees paid by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

LAMCO receives a quarterly investment advisory fee based on the Fund's average
weekly net assets at the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
      AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS         FEE RATE
      -------------------------         --------
         <S>                              <C>
         First $300 million               0.80%
         Over $300 million                0.72%
</Table>

Under Portfolio Manager Agreements, LAMCO pays each Portfolio Manager a
portfolio management fee based on the assets of the investment portfolio that
they manage. The portfolio management fee is paid from the investment advisory
fees collected by LAMCO and is based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at
the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
      AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS         FEE RATE
      -------------------------         --------
         <S>                              <C>
         First $300 million               0.40%
         Over $300 million                0.36%
</Table>

ADMINISTRATION FEE

LAMCO provides administrative and other services for a quarterly administration
fee based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at the following annual rates:

<Table>

      AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS         FEE RATE
      -------------------------         --------

         First $300 million               0.20%
          Over $300 million               0.18%
</Table>

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia"), an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of BOA and an affiliate of LAMCO, is responsible for providing
pricing and bookkeeping services to the Fund under a pricing and bookkeeping
agreement. Under a separate agreement (the "Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia
has delegated those functions to State Street Corporation ("State Street"). As a
result, Columbia pays the total fees

                                       33
<Page>

collected from the Fund for these services to State Street under the Outsourcing
Agreement.

     Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Fund, Columbia
receives from the Fund an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any
month that the Fund's average weekly net assets exceed $50 million, an
additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is calculated by taking into
account the fees payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. This
rate is applied to the average daily net assets of the Fund for that month. The
Fund also pays additional fees for pricing services based on the number of
securities held by the Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the effective
pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.024%.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Fund could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement
in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS

With the exception of one officer, all officers of the Fund are employees of
LAMCO or its affiliates and receive no compensation from the Fund. Effective
August 23, 2004, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to
the Fund in accordance with federal securities regulations. The Fund, along with
other affiliated funds, will pay its pro-rata share of the expenses associated
with the Office of the Chief Compliance Officer.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Fund related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund paid $1,506 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Miscellaneous expense"
on the Statement of Operations.

NOTE 6. OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF LIBERTY ALL-STAR GROWTH FUND,
INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the investment portfolio, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc.
(the "Fund") at December 31, 2004, and the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets and its financial highlights for the periods
indicated, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. The financial highlights of the Fund for
periods prior to January 1, 1999 were audited by another independent registered
public accounting firm whose report dated February 12, 1999 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements.

AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (UNAUDITED)

Each shareholder of the Fund will automatically be a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan as amended June 30, 1996
(the "Plan"), unless the shareholder specifically elects other- wise by writing
to the agent for participants in the Plan, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the
"Plan Agent"), P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010 or by calling
1-800-LIB-FUND (1-800-542-3863). Shareholders whose shares are held in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee must notify their brokerage firm,
bank or nominee if they do not wish to participate in the Plan.

     Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
other nominee will be able to participate in the Plan only if their brokerage
firm, bank or nominee is able to do so on their behalf. Shareholders
participating in the Plan through a brokerage firm may not be able to transfer
their shares to another brokerage firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

     Under the Plan, all dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund
are automatically reinvested by the Plan Agent in additional shares of the Fund.
Distributions declared payable in shares or cash at the option of shareholders
are paid to participants in the Plan entirely in newly issued full and
fractional shares valued at the lower of market value or net asset value per
share on the valuation date for the distribution (but not a discount of more
than 5 percent from market price). Distributions declared payable only in cash
will be reinvested for the accounts of participants in the Plan in additional
shares purchased by the Plan Agent on the open market at prevailing market
prices. If, prior to the Plan Agent's completion of such open market purchases,
the market price of a share equals or exceeds its net asset value, the remainder
of the distribution will be paid in newly issued shares valued at net asset
value (but not at a discount of more than 5 percent from market price).
Dividends and distributions are subject to taxation, whether received in cash or
in shares.

     Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments
in any amount from $100 to $3,000 on a monthly basis for investment in shares of
the Fund purchased on the open market. These voluntary cash payments will be
invested on or about the 15th day of each calendar month, and voluntary payments
should be sent so as to be received by the Plan Agent no later than 10 days
before the next investment date. Barring suspension of trading, voluntary cash
payments will be invested within 45 days of receipt. A participant may withdraw
a voluntary cash payment by written notice received by the Plan Agent at least
48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

     The Plan Agent maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmations of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

     There is no charge to participants for reinvesting distributions pursuant
to the Plan. The Plan Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. There are no brokerage
charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of
dividends or distributions declared payable in shares or in cash. However, each
participant bears a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of distributions declared payable only in cash.

     With respect to purchases from voluntary cash payments, the Plan Agent will
charge $1.25 for each such purchase for a participant, plus a pro rata share of
the brokerage commissions. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts of
shares for individual accounts through the Plan are expected to be less than the
usual brokerage charges for such transactions, as the Plan Agent will be
purchasing shares for all participants in blocks and prorating the lower
commission thus attainable.

     Shareholders may terminate their participation in the Plan by written
notice to the Plan Agent, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43010,
Providence, RI 02940-3010. Such termination will be effective immediately if
received not less than 10 days prior to the record date for a dividend or
distribution; otherwise it will be effective on the first business day after the
payment date of such dividend or distribution. On termination, participants may
either have certificates for the Fund shares in their Plan accounts delivered to
them or have the Plan Agent sell such shares in the open market and deliver the
proceeds, less a $2.50 fee plus brokerage commissions, to the participant.

     Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

    (a) The registrant has, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
        adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
        executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
        officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
        regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the registrant
        or a third party.

    (b) During the period covered by this report, there were not any amendments
        to a provision of the code of ethics adopted in 2(a) above.

    (c) During the period covered by this report, there were not any waivers or
        implicit waivers to a provision of the code of ethics adopted in 2(a)
        above.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Audit Committee is composed of four of the registrant's
independent directors who are not affiliated with the registrant's investment
adviser. The Board has determined that each of the audit committee members is
"financially literate" and that at least one member has "accounting or related
financial management expertise" as used in the New York Stock Exchange
definitions of the terms.

        Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if the Board of Directors has not
determined that a "financial expert," a new term based on criteria contained in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is serving on the audit committee, it must disclose this
fact and explain why the committee does not have such an expert. The Board of
Directors has determined that none of the members of its audit committee meets
the technical requirements of the definition. Moreover, it believes that for the
following reasons it is not necessary for a registered investment company such
as the registrant, with an audit committee that meets the New York Stock
Exchange requirements of financial literacy, to have a "financial expert" as a
member of the committee.

1. The financial statements of and accounting principles applying to registered
   investment companies such as the registrant are relatively straightforward
   and transparent compared to those of operating companies. The significant
   accounting

<Page>

   issues are valuation of securities and other assets (regulated under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") and computed daily), accrual
   of expenses, allocation of joint expenses shared with other entities, such as
   insurance premiums, and disclosures of all related party transactions.
   Equally important is a knowledge of the tax laws applying to registered
   investment companies. None of the accounting issues involving corporate
   America that have received recent publicity, such as sophisticated derivative
   transactions and special purpose entities, are present in financial reporting
   for registered investment companies.

2. During the years that the registrant has been filing financial reports under
   the 1940 Act since its inception in 1986 there has never been a requirement
   for a financial report or statement to be restated.

3. The current members of the audit committee have many years of aggregate
   experience serving on this audit committee and in the Board's judgment,
   through this experience and experience with other public corporation's
   financial affairs, they have an understanding of the relevant generally
   accepted accounting principles governing the registrant's financial
   statements, tax laws applying to the registrant, the registrant's internal
   accounting controls and audit committee functions necessary to satisfy the
   objectives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the financial
   statements, auditing process and internal controls of the registrant.

4. The audit committee has the capability of employing a consultant who
   satisfies the technical definition of a "financial expert" and will do so
   from time to time if circumstances warrant.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

(a) Aggregate Audit Fees billed by the principal accountant for professional
services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003 are approximately as follows:

                                       2004           2003
                                       $ 24,700       $ 27,500

Audit Fees include amounts related to the audit of the registrant's annual
financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal
years. In fiscal year 2003, Audit Fees include a proxy review and issuance of a
consent letter in connection with a rights offering.

(b) Aggregate Audit-Related Fees billed by the principal accountant for
professional services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003 are approximately as follows:

<Page>

                                       2004           2003
                                       $ 4,000        $ 4,000

Audit-Related Fees include amounts for assurance and related services by the
principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported in Audit Fees
above. In both fiscal years 2004 and 2003, Audit-Related Fees include certain
agreed-upon procedures performed for semi-annual shareholder reports.

(c) Aggregate Tax Fees billed by the principal accountant for professional
services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003 are approximately as follows:

                                       2004           2003
                                       $ 2,600        $ 2,600

Tax Fees in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 consist primarily of the review of
annual tax returns and include amounts for professional services by the
principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.

(d) Aggregate All Other Fees billed by the principal accountant for professional
services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003 are as follows:

                                       2004           2003
                                       $ 0            $ 0

All Other Fees include amounts for products and services provided by the
principal accountant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a) through
(c) above.

None of the amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (d) above were approved
pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01
of Regulation S-X.

(e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Audit Committee of the registrant has adopted a formal policy (the "Policy")
which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which the Audit
Committee will pre-approve (i) all audit and non-audit (including audit related,
tax and all other) services provided by the registrant's independent auditor to
the registrant and individual funds (collectively "Fund Services"), and (ii) all
non-audit services provided by the registrant's independent auditor to the
funds' adviser or a control affiliate of the adviser, that relate directly to
the funds' operations and financial reporting (collectively "Fund-related

<Page>

Adviser Services"). A "control affiliate" is an entity controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to
the funds, and the term "adviser" is deemed to exclude any unaffiliated
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted
or overseen by another investment adviser. The adviser and control affiliates
are collectively referred to as "Adviser Entities."

The Audit Committee uses a combination of specific (on a case-by-case basis as
potential services are contemplated) and general (pre-determined list of
permitted services) pre-approvals. Unless a type of service has received general
pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it
is to be provided by the independent auditor.

The Policy does not delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to
pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURES

On an annual basis, the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration
shall submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of Fund Services and
Fund-related Adviser Services that are subject to general pre-approval.

These schedules will provide a description of each type of service that is
subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide estimated fees
for each instance of providing each service. This general pre-approval and
related fees (where provided) will generally cover a one-year period (for
example, from June 1 through May 31 of the following year). The Audit Committee
will review and approve the types of services and review the projected fees for
the next one-year period and may add to, or subtract from, the list of general
pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.
This approval acknowledges that the Audit Committee is in agreement with the
specific types of services that the independent auditor will be permitted to
perform. The fee amounts will be updated to the extent necessary at other
regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee.

In addition to the fees for each individual service, the Audit Committee has the
authority to implement a fee cap on the aggregate amount of non-audit services
provided to an individual fund.

If, subsequent to general pre-approval, a fund, its investment adviser or a
control affiliate determines that it would like to engage the independent
auditor to perform a service that requires pre-approval and that is not included
in the general pre-approval list, the specific pre-approval procedure shall be
as follows:

    -    A brief written request shall be prepared by management detailing the
         proposed engagement with explanation as to why the work is proposed to
         be performed by the independent auditor;

<Page>

    -    The request should be addressed to the Audit Committee with copies to
         the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration;
    -    The Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will
         arrange for a discussion of the service to be included on the agenda
         for the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, when the
         Committee will discuss the proposed engagement and approve or deny the
         request.
    -    If the timing of the project is critical and the project needs to
         commence before the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Chairperson
         of the Audit Committee may approve or deny the request on behalf of the
         Audit Committee, or, in the Chairperson's discretion, determine to call
         a special meeting of the Audit Committee for the purpose of considering
         the proposal. Should the Chairperson of the Audit Committee be
         unavailable, any other member of the Audit Committee may serve as an
         alternate for the purpose of approving or denying the request.
         Discussion with the Chairperson (or alternate, if necessary) will be
         arranged by the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee
         Administration. The independent auditor will not commence any such
         project unless and until specific approval has been given.

III. CERTAIN OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO ADVISER ENTITIES

The Audit Committee recognizes that there are cases where services proposed to
be provided by the independent auditor to the adviser or control affiliates are
not Fund-related Adviser Services within the meaning of the Policy, but
nonetheless may be relevant to the Audit Committee's ongoing evaluation of the
auditor's independence and objectivity with respect to its audit services to the
funds. As a result, in all cases where an Adviser Entity engages the independent
auditor to provide audit or non-audit services that are not Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services, were not subject to pre-approval by the Audit
Committee, and the projected fees for any such engagement (or the aggregate of
all such engagements during the period covered by the Policy) exceeds a
pre-determined threshold established by the Audit Committee; the independent
auditor, Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will notify
the Audit Committee not later than its next meeting. Such notification shall
include a general description of the services provided, the entity that is to be
the recipient of such services, the timing of the engagement, the entity's
reasons for selecting the independent auditor, and the projected fees. Such
information will allow the Audit Committee to consider whether non-audit
services provided to the adviser and Adviser Entities, which were not subject to
Audit Committee pre-approval, are compatible with maintaining the auditor's
independence with respect to the Funds.

IV. REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Fund Treasurer or Director of Trustee Administration shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was rendered,
including:

    -    A general description of the services, and

<Page>

    -    Actual billed and projected fees, and
    -    The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser Services
         were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

In addition, the independent auditor shall report to the Audit Committee
annually, and no more than 90 days prior to the filing of audit reports with the
SEC, all non-audit services provided to entities in the funds' "investment
company complex," as defined by SEC rules, that did not require pre-approval
under the Policy.

V. AMENDMENTS; ANNUAL APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Policy may be amended from time to time by the Audit Committee. Prompt
notice of any amendments will be provided to the independent auditor, Fund
Treasurer and Director of Trustee Administration. The Policy shall be reviewed
and approved at least annually by the Audit Committee.

                                      *****

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
this Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during both fiscal years ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was zero.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for services
rendered to the registrant for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 are disclosed in (b) through (d) of this Item.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, there
were no Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees or All Other Fees that were approved for
services to the investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant under
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

The percentage of Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees required to be
approved under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X that were
approved under the "de minimis" exception during both fiscal years ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was zero.

(h) The registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity

<Page>

controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved
pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, is compatible
with maintaining the principal accountant's independence. The Audit Committee
determined that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining
the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(58)(A)). John A. Benning, James E. Grinnell, Richard W. Lowry and John J.
Neuhauser are each independent trustees and collectively constitute the entire
Audit Committee.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The registrant's "Schedule I - Investments in securities of unaffiliated
issuers" (as set forth in 17 CFR 210.12-12) is included in Item 1 of this Form
N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Fund has delegated to Liberty Asset Management Company (the "Advisor") the
responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the
Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the Board of
Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and procedures adopted
by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the Advisor follows when a
vote presents a conflict between the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its
other clients or other persons. The Advisor examines each proposal and votes
against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of
the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each proposal and votes the
proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the proposal would be
expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund. The Advisor
determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the potential economic
return on the Fund's investment.

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines. For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines the
vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any benefit to
the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. The Advisor's
Proxy Committee includes a representative from Liberty Asset Management Company
and representatives from the Advisor's equity investments and equity research
functions. In addition to the responsibilities described above, the Proxy
Committee has the responsibility to review, on an annual basis, the Advisor's
proxy voting policies to ensure consistency with internal policies

<Page>

and regulatory agency policies and to develop additional voting guidelines to
assist in the review of proxy proposals.

The Proxy Committee may vary from the predetermined guideline if it determines
that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined guideline would be
expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of the
issuer's securities or to affect adversely the best interest of the client.
References to the best interest of a client refer to the interest of the client
in terms of the potential economic return on the client's investment. In
determining the vote on any proposal, the Proxy Committee does not consider any
benefit other than benefits to the owner of the securities to be voted. A member
of the Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for which he or
she has a conflict of interest by reason of a direct relationship with the
issuer or other party affected by a given proposal. Persons making
recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its members are required to disclose
to the Committee any relationship with a party making a proposal or other matter
known to the person that would create a potential conflict of interest.

The Advisor has retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third
party vendor, to implement its proxy voting process. ISS provides proxy
analysis, record keeping services and vote disclosure services.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Not yet applicable.

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

During the six month period ended December 31, 2004, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any "affiliated purchaser," as defined
in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"),
of shares or other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities that
are registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have not been any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors, since those
procedures were last disclosed in response to the requirements of Item
7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

    (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
         officers, based on their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure
         controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing of
         this report, have concluded that such controls and procedures are
         adequately designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
         by the registrant in Form N-CSR is accumulated and communicated to the
         registrant's management, including the principal executive officer and

<Page>

         principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions,
         as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

    (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
         financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's second fiscal
         quarter of the period covered by this report that has materially
         affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a)(1) Code of ethics required to be disclosed under Item 2 of Form N-CSR
attached hereto as Exhibit 99.CODE ETH.

(a)(2) Certifications pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) under the Investment Company Act

(b) Certification pursuant to Rule 30a-2(b) under the Investment Company Act of

                                                             Exhibit 99.Code Eth

                    COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT GROUP FAMILY OF FUNDS
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

     I.     COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

                 This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies
            within the Columbia Management Group fund complex (collectively the
            "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to the Funds' Principal
            Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting
            Officer, and Director of Trustee Administration (the "Covered
            Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

                 -  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling
                    of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal
                    and professional relationships;
                 -  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure
                    in reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits
                    to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in
                    other public communications made by a Fund;
                 -  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                    regulations;
                 -  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to
                    an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
                 -  accountability for adherence to the Code.

                 Each Covered Officer shall adhere to a high standard of
            business ethics and shall be sensitive to situations that may give
            rise to actual or apparent conflicts of interest.

     II.    ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

                 .  The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the Funds
            (collectively, the "Board") shall designate an individual to be
            primarily responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code
            Officer"). The Code shall be administered by the Columbia Management
            Group Compliance Department. In the absence of the Code Officer, his
            or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
            temporary basis.

                 Each Fund has designated a chief legal officer (the "Chief
            Legal Officer") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
            the rules promulgated thereunder. The Chief Legal Officer of a Fund
            shall assist the Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code.
            The Chief Legal Officer shall be responsible for applying this Code
            to specific situations in which questions are presented under it (in
            consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and has the
            authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.
            However, any

<Page>

            waivers sought by a Covered Officer must be approved by each Audit
            Committee of the Funds (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

     III.   MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                 OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
            Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or
            his/her service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest
            would arise if a Covered Officer, or a family member, receives
            improper personal benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's
            position with a Fund.

                 Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships
            between Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to
            conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of
            1940 (the "Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
            (the "Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not
            individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or
            sale of securities or other property) with a Fund because of their
            status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. A Fund's and its
            investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed
            to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of those provisions.
            This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace those
            programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the
            parameters of this Code.

                 Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
            personal benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
            contractual relationship between a Fund and its investment adviser,
            administrator, principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent
            and/or transfer agent (each, a "Service Provider") of which the
            Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
            Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course
            of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for a Service
            Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
            implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
            Service Provider and a Fund. The participation of the Covered
            Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
            relationship between the Fund and the Service Provider and is
            consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
            duties as officers of a Fund. In addition, it is recognized by the
            Board that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of
            one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
            codes.

                 Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if
            such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions of the
            Company Act and the Advisers Act. The following list provides
            examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered
            Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive.
            The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered
            Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of a
            Fund.

<Page>

                 Each Covered Officer must:

                 -  not use personal influence or personal relationships
                    improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                    reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer or an
                    immediate family member would benefit personally to the
                    detriment of a Fund; and

                 -  not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
                    the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer or an
                    immediate family member rather than the benefit of the
                    Fund.(1).

                 There are some conflict of interest situations that must be
            approved by the Code Officer, after consultation with the Chief
            Legal Officer. Those situations include, but are not limited to,:

                 -  service as director on the board of any public or private
                    company;
                 -  the receipt of any gifts in excess of $100 in the aggregate
                    from a third party that does or seeks to do business with
                    the Funds during any 12-month period;
                 -  the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which
                    a Fund has current or prospective business dealings, unless
                    such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
                    appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                    raise any question of impropriety;
                 -  any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or
                    employment relationship with, any Fund service providers,
                    other than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,
                    administrator or any affiliated person thereof;
                 -  a direct or indirect material financial interest in
                    commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund
                    for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or
                    redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the
                    Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity
                    ownership.

     IV.    DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

                 Each Covered Officer shall:

                 -  be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally
                    applicable to the Funds;

- ----------
(1) For purposes of this Code, personal trading activity of the Covered Officers
shall be monitored in accordance with the Columbia Management Group Code of
Ethics. Each Covered Officer shall be considered an "Access Person" under such
Code. The term "immediate family" shall have the same meaning as provided in
such Code.

<Page>

                 -  not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
                    facts about any Fund to others, whether within or outside
                    the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors, and
                    to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
                    organizations;
                 -  to the extent appropriate within his/her area of
                    responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
                    the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting full,
                    fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
                    reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the
                    SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds;
                    and
                 -  promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
                    imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

     V.     REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

                 Each Covered Officer must:

                 -  upon adoption of the Code (or after becoming a Covered
                    Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has
                    received, read and understands the Code;
                 -  annually affirm to the Board compliance with the
                    requirements of the Code;
                 -  not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                    employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                    reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                 -  notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Code Officer promptly
                    if he/she knows of any violation of this Code; and
                 -  respond to the trustee and officer questionnaires circulated
                    periodically in connection with the preparation of
                    disclosure documents for the Funds.

                 The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities
            related to this Code.

                 The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in
            investigating and enforcing this Code:

                 -  The Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer will take
                    all appropriate action to investigate any potential
                    violation reported to him/her;
                 -  If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer and
                    the Code Officer believes that no violation has occurred,
                    the Code Officer will notify the person(s) reporting the
                    potential violation, and no further action is required;
                 -  Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code
                    Officer believes is a violation will be reported to the
                    Audit Committee;

<Page>

                 -  If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has
                    occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to the
                    Board, which will consider appropriate action, which may
                    include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                    applicable policies and procedures; notification to the
                    Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management Group; or a
                    recommendation to sanction or dismiss the Covered Officer;
                 -  The Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers
                    in its sole discretion;
                 -  Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                    required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

                 The Chief Legal Officer shall:

                 -  report to the Audit Committee quarterly any approvals
                    provided in accordance with Section III of this Code; and
                 -  report to the Audit Committee quarterly any violations of,
                    or material issues arising under, this Code.

     VI.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                 This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds
            for the purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
            rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies
            thereunder. Insofar as other polices or procedures of the Funds or
            the Funds' Service Providers govern or purport to govern the
            behavior or activities (including, but not limited to, personal
            trading activities) of the Covered Officers who are subject to this
            Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
            overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and
            their investment advisers' and principal underwriter's codes of
            ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act and any policies and
            procedures of the Service Providers are separate requirements
            applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

     VII.   AMENDMENTS

                 All material amendments to this Code must be approved or
            ratified by the Board, including a majority of independent
            directors.

     VIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

                 All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this
            Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and
            protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this
            Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
            Board, the Covered Officers, the Chief Legal Officer, the Code
            Officer, outside audit firms and legal counsel to the Funds, and
            senior management of Columbia Management Group.

     IX.    INTERNAL USE

                 The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds
            and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund,
            as to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.

     Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     (d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the
          registrant's second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
          report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
          materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
          reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
