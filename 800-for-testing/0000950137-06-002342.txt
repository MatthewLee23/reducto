PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index is generally representative of
high-yield securities. The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales
charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be
considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

                                                                               1

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005

Van Kampen High Income Trust II is managed by the Adviser's High Yield team.(1)
Current team members include Gordon Loery, Executive Director of the Adviser;
and Josh Givelber, Vice President of the Adviser.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The fundamentals of the high yield bond market remained generally positive
throughout 2005. Default rates remained low, the economy advanced at a good
clip, and corporate earnings trends continued to be favorable. Given the low
yields available in the long-term bond market, high yield bonds were also
rewarded by income-oriented investors.

However, the period was also marked by notable volatility. After particularly
strong performance in 2004, the fortunes of the high yield market shifted
dramatically in the first portion of 2005. Heavy issuance in January resulted in
a less-favorable supply-and-demand relationship and unsettled the market. In
mid-March, General Motors (GM) announced poor earnings and production cuts.
Apprehensions about the auto industry gave way to anxiety about the strength of
other corporations and the broad economy. High yield investors also were
troubled that the migration of GM and other auto-related bonds from the
investment-grade universe to the high yield universe could further disrupt
supply and demand trends. In the face of these uncertainties, the high yield
market declined through mid-May.

On a more positive note, the high yield market recovered over the balance of the
year, despite protracted high oil prices and the devastation caused by the Gulf
Coast hurricanes. Investors adjusted to the inclusion of GM and Ford Motor
within the high yield universe, and new issuance slowed. The fundamental
strength of the high yield market and the resiliency of the U.S. economy helped
to sustain investor interest in the asset class.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV basis and a market price basis, the trust underperformed its
benchmark index, the J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

As the airline and auto industries struggled throughout the period, the trust
was well served by its underweighting in the transportation sector relative to
the J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index. Moreover, our investment analysis led
us to steer clear of several of the most troubled names in the auto and
auto-parts industry. Security selection in the cable sector and utility sectors
also helped boost relative performance.

The trust was hindered by security selection in the forest products, housing and
financials sectors. Within forest products, company-specific events slowed
performance. In the housing sector, building product companies faltered as
concerns grew about a slowing housing market. Because many building product
companies carry high levels of debt, they would likely be particularly
vulnerable to a real estate downturn. In financials, negative company-specific
developments hindered the trust's return.

Throughout the period, we sought to maintain a balanced and well-diversified
portfolio. Our research-intensive, risk-conscious approach led us to increase
the trust's exposure to the transportation, healthcare, food and tobacco, and
energy sectors. Although we increased exposure to transportation, the trust
remained underweight as compared to the index at the end of the reporting
period. In contrast, we decreased exposure to the housing, diversified media,
and cable industries.

As the year progressed, we slightly decreased the amount of overall credit risk
in the portfolio within the parameters of our income-oriented discipline. We
adopted this more conservative posture because the lower-quality segment of the

                                                                               3

market appeared to offer less value, in our view. In terms of issuer size, we
continued to focus on larger companies because of their financial flexibility,
their relative ability to withstand less-favorable financial conditions, and
their superior access to capital markets.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform well
or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in the future.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2005

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At December 31, 2005, the Trust had no when-issued and
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of
debt instruments.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2005, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $60,509,040 which will expire according to the
following table:

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly

if any, are distributed annually to common shareholders. Distributions from net

federal income tax purposes, permanent differences between book and tax basis
reporting for the 2005 fiscal year have been identified and appropriately
reclassified. Permanent differences of $152,303 relating to consent fee income
received from tender offers were reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to accumulated net realized loss. A permanent book and tax
difference relating to excise taxes paid which are not deductible for tax
purposes totaling $10,252 was reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to paid in surplus. Additionally, permanent book and tax
differences of $251,496 relating to book to tax amortization differences were
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized loss. A permanent book to tax difference of $213,360 relating to
merger costs which are not deductible for tax purposes was reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to paid in surplus.

    As of December 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $277,255
Long-term capital gain......................................       -0-

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

    On July 29, 2005 the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of Van

approved by VIT shareholders on July 22, 2005. The Trust issued 10,784,621
common shares with a net asset value of $49,072,045 and 1,504 Auction Preferred
Shares ("APS") with a liquidation value of $37,600,000 in exchange for VIT's net
assets. The shares of VIT were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of

unrealized depreciation of VIT as of July 29, 2005 was $1,265,478. The Trust
assumed VIT book to tax accretion differences, which resulted in a $263,880
increase to accumulated undistributed net investment income and a corresponding
decrease to net unrealized appreciation. Combined net assets applicable to
common shares on the day of reorganization were $85,969,581 and combined net
assets including preferred shares were $151,369,581. Included in these net
assets was a capital loss carryforward of $33,329,662, of which all can be
utilized by the acquiring Trust, deferred compensation and retirement plan
balance of $229,390 and non-accrual interest income of $16,968, all carried
forward from the Van Kampen High Income Trust. The Trust incurred merger

printing, and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Reorganization
Agreement and registration statements as well as legal, audit, and filing fees.

liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

                                                                              21

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen High Income Trust II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of December 31, 2005, the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of December 31, 2005, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II as of December 31, 2005, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item 2.  Code of Ethics.

(a) The Trust has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that applies
to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Trust or a third
party.

(b) No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c) The Trust has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by the
shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund.":

"Each Covered Officer must not use his personal influence or personal
relationship improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
indirectly)."

Further, due to personnel changes at the Adviser, the list of Covered Officers
set forth in Exhibit B and the General Counsel designee to whom questions about
the application of the Code should be referred in Exhibit C were amended during
the period. Exhibit B was then amended again in March 2005 and a third time in
August 2005 and a fourth time in September 2005. All four editions of Exhibit B
are attached. Additionally, Exhibit B was amended to remove Mitchell M. Merin as
a covered officer.

(d) Not applicable.

(e) Not applicable.

(f)

      (1) The Trust's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit 12A.

      (2) Not applicable.

      (3) Not applicable.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has two "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Trustees : Jerry Choate and R. Craig Kennedy. Under applicable
securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit committee financial
expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose, including without
limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a
result of being designated or identified as an audit committee financial expert.
The designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial
expert does not impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liabilities
that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on such
person as a member of the audit committee and Board of Trustees in the absence
of such designation or identification.

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)

1. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

      The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

      The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

      For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

      The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

      The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

(1)   This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
      Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above,
      supercedes and replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from
      time to time.

(2)   Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
      meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

      The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

      The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.

2. DELEGATION

      As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3. AUDIT SERVICES

      The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

      In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

      The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4. AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

      Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

      The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in
Appendix B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the
Audit Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5. TAX SERVICES

      The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

      Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6. ALL OTHER SERVICES

      The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

      The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

      A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7. PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

      Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8. PROCEDURES

      All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

      The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

      The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10. COVERED ENTITIES

      Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

      - Van Kampen Investments Inc.

      - Van Kampen Asset Management

      - Van Kampen Advisors Inc.

      - Van Kampen Funds Inc.

      - Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.

      - Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.

      - Morgan Stanley Trust Company

      - Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.

      - Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company

      - Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

<PAGE>

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f) Not applicable.

(g) See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

(a) The Trust has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are:
Craig Kennedy, Jerry Choate and Rod Dammeyer.

(b) Not applicable.

Item 6.  Schedule of Investments.

Please refer to Item #1.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I. POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. The Policy will be reviewed and, updated, as necessary, to address new
or revised proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by the Policy
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company,
Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP, Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds)(collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable
investment advisory agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as
authorized by the Board of Directors or Trustees of the

<PAGE>

MSIM Funds. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named fiduciary" for
an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the case of an
account not governed by ERISA, the investment management or investment advisory
agreement does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates
will, in a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of
clients, including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit
plan(s) for which the MSIM Affiliates manage assets, consistent with the
objective of maximizing long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard").
In certain situations, a client or its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate
with a proxy voting policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply
with the client's policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable
laws or regulations or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as MSIM Affiliates may
retain from time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers
that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services
to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants,
and other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth
research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the MSIM
Affiliates may review and utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers
in making proxy voting decisions, they are in no way obligated to follow such
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the
Research Providers.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - While the proxy voting process
is well established in the United States and other developed markets with a
number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting
proxies of non-U.S. companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly
emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent
a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies
will be voted on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and
benefits to MSIM's clients of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance to the MSIM
Affiliates in connection with voting their clients' non-U.S. proxies.

II. GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) this Policy,
including the guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range
of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that arise most
frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may, pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section IV. below, vote in a manner that is not in accordance with the
following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved by the Proxy Review
Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. A MSIM Affiliate
will not generally vote a proxy if it has sold the affected security between the
record date and the meeting date.

<PAGE>

III. GUIDELINES

A. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS. The following proposals will generally be voted
as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

      i. General.

      1.    Generally, routine management proposals will be supported. The
            following are examples of routine management proposals:

            -     Approval of financial statements, director and auditor
                  reports.

            -     General updating/corrective amendments to the charter.

            -     Proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, except
                  those proposals that relate to the "transaction of such other
                  business which may come before the meeting."

      2.    Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting generally will be
            supported; proposals to establish cumulative voting in the election
            of directors will not be supported.

      3.    Proposals requiring confidential voting and independent tabulation
            of voting results will be supported.

      4.    Proposals requiring a U.S. company to have a separate Chairman and
            CEO will not be supported. Proposals requiring non-U.S. companies to
            have a separate Chairman and CEO will be supported.

      5.    Proposals by management of non-U.S. companies regarding items that
            are clearly related to the regular course of business will be
            supported.

      6.    Proposals to require the company to expense stock options will be
            supported.

      7.    Open-ended requests for adjournment generally will not be supported.
            However, where management specifically states the reason for
            requesting an adjournment and the requested adjournment is necessary
            to permit a proposal that would otherwise be supported under this
            Policy to be carried out (i.e. an uncontested corporate
            transaction), the adjournment request will be supported.

      8.    Proposals to declassify the Board of Directors (if management
            supports a classified board) generally will not be supported.

      9.    Proposal requiring that the company prepare reports that are costly
            to provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditures
            that are of a non-business nature or would provide no pertinent
            information from the perspective of institutional shareholders
            generally will not be supported.

      ii. Election of Directors. In situations where no conflict exists and
      where no specific governance deficiency has been noted, unless otherwise
      determined by the

<PAGE>

      Proxy Review Committee, proxies will be voted in support of nominees of
      management.

      1.    The following proposals generally will be supported:

            -     Proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66 2/3%)
                  of the company's board members be independent directors.

            -     Proposals requiring that members of the company's
                  compensation, nominating and audit committees be comprised of
                  independent or unaffiliated directors.

      2.    Unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, a
      withhold vote will be made in the following circumstances:

            (a)   If a company's board is not comprised of a majority of
                  disinsterested directors, a withhold vote will be made for
                  interested directors. A director nominee may be deemed to be
                  interested if the nominee has, or any time during the previous
                  five years had, a relationship with the issuer (e.g.,
                  investment banker, counsel or other professional service
                  provider, or familial relationship with a senior officer of
                  the issuer) that may impair his or her independence;

            (b)   If a nominee who is interested is standing for election as a
                  member of the company's compensation, nominating or audit
                  committees;

            (c)   A direct conflict exists between the interests of the nominee
                  and the public shareholders;

            (d)   Where the nominees standing for election have not taken action
                  to implement generally accepted governance practices for which
                  there is a "bright line" test. These would include elimination
                  of dead hand or slow hand poison pills, requiring audit,
                  compensation or nominating committees to be composed of
                  independent directors and requiring a majority independent
                  board;

            (e)   A nominee has failed to attend at least 75% of board meetings
                  within a given year without a reasonable excuse; or

            (f)   A nominee serves on the board of directors for more than six
                  companies (excluding investment companies).

      iii. Auditors

      1.    Generally, management proposals for selection or ratification of
            auditors will be supported. However, such proposals may not be
            supported if the audit fees are excessive. Generally, to determine
            if audit fees are excessive, a 50% test will be applied for audit
            fees in excess of $1 million: if audit fees are $1 million or more,
            non-audit fees should less than 50% of the total fees paid to the
            auditor. If audit fees are less than $1 million, the fees will be
            reviewed case by case by the Proxy Review Committee.

<PAGE>

      2.    Proposals requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of
            shareholders will be supported.

      3.    Proposals to indemnify auditors will not be supported.

      iv. Anti-Takeover Matters

      1.    Proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority vote
            requirements to amend the charter or bylaws will be supported;
            proposals to amend by-laws to require a supermajority shareholder
            vote to pass or repeal certain provisions will not be supported.

      2.    Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail provisions will
            be supported, provided that the proposal: (i) defines greenmail;
            (ii) prohibits buyback offers to large block holders (holders of at
            least 1% of the outstanding shares and in certain cases, a greater
            amount, as determined by the Proxy Review Committee) not made to all
            shareholders or not approved by disinterested shareholders; and
            (iii) contains no anti-takeover measures or other provisions
            restricting the rights of shareholders.

      3.    Proposals requiring shareholder approval or ratification of a
            shareholder rights plan or poison pill will be supported.

B. CAPITALIZATION CHANGES. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

      1.    The following proposals generally will be supported:

            -     Proposals relating to capitalization changes that eliminate
                  other classes of stock and/or eliminate unequal voting rights.

            -     Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of
                  common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if:
                  (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii)
                  the number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to
                  the purpose for which authorization is requested; and (iii)
                  the authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently
                  authorized and at least 30% of the new authorization will be
                  outstanding.

            -     Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for
                  issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital.

            -     Proposals for share repurchase plans.

            -     Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of common
                  or preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred
                  stock.

            -     Proposals to effect stock splits.

            -     Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
                  proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth
                  in the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not
                  adjust proportionately to the authorized share amount
                  generally will be approved if the resulting increase in

<PAGE>

                  authorized shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set
                  forth above for common stock increases.

      2.    The following proposals generally will not be supported
            (notwithstanding management support).

            -     Proposals relating to capitalization changes that add classes
                  of stock which substantially dilute the voting interests of
                  existing shareholders.

            -     Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of
                  existing classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or
                  supervoting rights.

            -     Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

            -     Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or
                  more.

C. COMPENSATION. The following proposals generally will be voted as indicated
below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

      1.    The following proposals generally will be supported:

            -     Proposals relating to director fees, provided the amounts are
                  not excessive relative to other companies in the country or
                  industry.

            -     Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit
                  discounts up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a
                  broad-based employee plan, including all non-executive
                  employees.

            -     Proposals for the establishment of employee stock option plans
                  and other employee ownership plans, provided that our research
                  does not indicate that approval of the plan would be against
                  shareholder interest.

            -     Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
                  severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate
                  that approval of the plan would be against shareholder
                  interest.

      2.    Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
            agreements will not be supported, however, proposals that require
            shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the
            annual compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported.

      3.    Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of executive
            compensation generally will not be supported.

      4.    Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive
            compensation in addition to the disclosure required by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations generally
            will not be supported.

D. OTHER RECURRING ITEMS. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

<PAGE>

      1.    Proposals to add restrictions related to social, political,
            environmental or special interest issues that do not relate directly
            to the business of the company and which do not appear to be
            directed specifically to the business or financial interest of the
            company generally will not be supported.

      2.    Proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are not
            required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals relate
            will not be supported.

E. ITEMS TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer, will be voted as
determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

      i.    Corporate Transactions

            -     Proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other special
                  corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of
                  assets, reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations)
                  will be examined on a case-by-case basis. In all cases,
                  Research Providers' research and analysis will be used along
                  with MSIM Affiliates' research and analysis, including, among
                  other things, MSIM internal company-specific knowledge.
                  Proposals for mergers or other significant transactions that
                  are friendly, approved by the Research Providers, and where
                  there is no portfolio manager objection, generally will be
                  supported.

      ii.   Compensation

            -     Proposals relating to change-in-control provisions in
                  non-salary compensation plans, employment contracts, and
                  severance agreements that benefit management and would be
                  costly to shareholders if triggered. With respect to proposals
                  related to severance and change of control situations, MSIM
                  Affiliates will support a maximum of three times salary and
                  bonus.

            -     Proposals relating to Executive/Director stock option plans.
                  Generally, stock option plans should be incentive based. The
                  Proxy Review Committee will evaluate the the quantitative
                  criteria used by a Research Provider when considering such
                  Research Provider's recommendation. If the Proxy Review
                  Committee determines that the criteria used by the Research
                  Provider is reasonable, the proposal will be supported if it
                  falls within a 5% band above the Research Provider's
                  threshold.

            -     Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock options
                  that have not been offered to employees in general.

      iii.  Other

            -     Proposals for higher dividend payouts.

            -     Proposals recommending set retirement ages or requiring
                  specific levels of stock ownership by directors.

<PAGE>

            -     Proposals for election of directors, where a director nominee
                  is related to MSIM (i.e. on an MSIM Fund's Board of
                  Directors/Trustees or part of MSIM senior management) must be
                  considered by the Proxy Review Committee. If the proposal
                  relates to a director nominee who is on a Van Kampen Fund's
                  Board of Directors/Trustees, to the extent that the shares of
                  the relevant company are held by a Van Kampen Fund, the Van
                  Kampen Board shall vote the proxies with respect to those
                  shares, to the extent practicable. In the event that the
                  Committee cannot contact the Van Kampen Board in advance of
                  the shareholder meeting, the Committee will vote such shares
                  pursuant to the Proxy Voting Policy.

            -     Proposals requiring diversity of board membership relating to
                  broad based social, religious or ethnic groups.

            -     Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden
                  indemnification of directors. Generally, the Proxy Review
                  Committee will support such proposals provided that the
                  officers and directors are eligible for indemnification and
                  liability protection if they have acted in good faith on
                  company business and were found innocent of any civil or
                  criminal charges for duties performed on behalf of the
                  company.

F. FUND OF FUNDS. Certain Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in
other MSIM funds. If an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to
avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the
same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund,
unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

IV. ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

A. PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

      1.    The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
            creating and implementing the Policy and, in this regard, has
            expressly adopted it.

            (a)   The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief Investment
                  Officer ("CIO"), consists of senior investment professionals
                  who represent the different investment disciplines and
                  geographic locations of the firm. The Committee is responsible
                  for establishing MSIM's Policy and determining how MSIM will
                  vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

            (b)   The Committee will periodically review and have the authority
                  to amend, as necessary, the Policy and establish and direct
                  voting positions consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

            (c)   The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
                  matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to the
                  Policy and (2) review proposals at upcoming shareholder
                  meetings of MSIM portfolio companies in accordance with this
                  Policy including, as appropriate, the voting results of prior
                  shareholder meetings of the same issuer where a similar
                  proposal was presented to shareholders. The Committee, or its

<PAGE>

                  designee, will timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Policy (and
                  any amendments to them and/or any additional guidelines or
                  procedures it may adopt).

            (d)   The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
                  matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain
                  shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the same
                  proxy solicitation and held by one or more MSIM portfolios to
                  be voted differently than other shares) and/or "override
                  voting" (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner
                  contrary to the Policy); (2) review and approve upcoming
                  votes, as appropriate, for matters for which specific
                  direction has been provided in this Policy; and (3) determine
                  how to vote matters for which specific direction has not been
                  provided in this Policy. Split votes generally will not be
                  approved within a single Global Investor Group investment
                  team. The Committee may take into account Research Providers'
                  recommendations and research as well as any other relevant
                  information they may request or receive, including portfolio
                  manager and/or analyst research, as applicable. Generally,
                  proxies related to securities held in accounts that are
                  managed pursuant to quantitative, index or index-like
                  strategies ("Index Strategies") will be voted in the same
                  manner as those held in actively managed accounts. Because
                  accounts managed using Index Strategies are passively managed
                  accounts, research from portfolio managers and/or analysts
                  related to securities held in these accounts may not be
                  available. If the affected securities are held only in
                  accounts that are managed pursuant to Index Strategies, and
                  the proxy relates to a matter that is not described in this
                  Policy, the Committee will consider all available information
                  from the Research Providers, and to the extent that the
                  holdings are significant, from the portfolio managers and/or
                  analysts.

            (e)   In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                  Committee determines that an issue raises a potential material
                  conflict of interest, or gives rise to the appearance of a
                  potential material conflict of interest, the Committee will
                  request a special committee to review, and recommend a course
                  of action with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                  ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee shall be
                  comprised of the Chairperson of the Proxy Review Committee,
                  the Compliance Director for the area of the firm involved or
                  his/her designee, a senior portfolio manager (if practicable,
                  one who is a member of the Proxy Review Committee) designated
                  by the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's Chief Investment
                  Officer or his/her designee. The Special Committee may request
                  the assistance of MSIM's General Counsel or his/her designee
                  and will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In addition to
                  the research provided by Research Providers, the Special
                  Committee may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate investment
                  professionals and outside sources to the extent it deems
                  appropriate.

            (f)   The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                  will document in writing all of their decisions and actions,
                  which documentation will be maintained by the Committee and
                  the Special Committee, or their designee(s), for a period of
                  at least 6 years. To the

<PAGE>

                  extent these decisions relate to a security held by a MSIM
                  U.S. registered investment company, the Committee and Special
                  Committee, or their designee(s), will report their decisions
                  to each applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of those
                  investment companies at each Board's next regularly scheduled
                  Board meeting. The report will contain information concerning
                  decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee during
                  the most recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding
                  the Board meeting.

            (g)   The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                  will timely communicate to applicable portfolio managers, the
                  Compliance Departments and, as necessary, to ISS, decisions of
                  the Committee and Special Committee so that, among other
                  things, ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

B. IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

            1.    If there is a possibility that a vote may involve a material
                  conflict of interest, the vote must be decided by the Special
                  Committee in consultation with MSIM's General Counsel or
                  his/her designee.

            2.    A material conflict of interest could exist in the following
                  situations, among others:

            (a)   The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an
                  affiliate of MSIM and the vote is on a material matter
                  affecting the issuer;

            (b)   The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any other
                  security issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates; or

            (c)   Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the matter
                  submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial advisor to a
                  party to a merger or acquisition for which Morgan Stanley will
                  be paid a success fee if completed).

C. PROXY VOTING REPORTS

            (a)   MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any client
                  requesting them. MSIM will also, upon client request, promptly
                  provide a report indicating how each proxy was voted with
                  respect to securities held in that client's account.

            (b)   MSIM's legal department is responsible for filing an annual
                  Form N-PX on behalf of each registered management investment
                  company for which such filing is required, indicating how all
                  proxies were voted with respect to such investment company's
                  holdings.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                                TRUST MANAGEMENT

<PAGE>

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Trust is managed by
members of the Adviser's Taxable Fixed Income team. The team consists of
portfolio managers and analysts. Current members of the team jointly and
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust's portfolio are
Gordon W. Loery, an Executive Director of the Adviser and Joshua Givelber, a
Vice President of the Adviser.

Mr. Loery has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since June 1990 and joined the team managing the Trust in July 2001.
Mr. Givelber has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since June 1999 and joined the team managing the Trust in April 2003.

The composition of the team may change without notice from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

The following information is dated as of December 31, 2005

As of December 31, 2005, Mr. Loery managed eleven mutual funds with a total of
approximately $2.1 billion in assets; five pooled investment vehicles other than
mutual funds with a total of approximately $934 million; and one other account
with a total of approximately $1 thousand.

As of December 31, 2005, Mr. Givelber managed seven mutual funds with a total of
approximately $1.6 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
mutual funds; and no other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Trust, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio managers may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Trust. The portfolio managers of the Trust do not currently manage assets for
other investment companies, pooled investment vehicles or other accounts that
charge a performance fee. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other
policies and procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to address
these and other conflicts of interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

BASE SALARY COMPENSATION. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

- - Cash Bonus;

- - Morgan Stanley's Equity Incentive Compensation Program (EICP) awards -- a
mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation
into restricted stock

<PAGE>

units or other awards based on Morgan Stanley common stock that are subject to
vesting and other conditions;

- - Investment Management Deferred Compensation Plan (IMDCP) awards -- a mandatory
program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation and
notionally invests it in designated Trusts advised by the Adviser or its
affiliates. The award is subject to vesting and other conditions. Portfolio
managers must notionally invest a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 75% of the
IMDCP deferral into a combination of the designated open-end funds they manage
that are included in the IMDCP Fund menu;

- - Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary year-end
compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred amount: (1) across a
range of designated investment Trusts, including Trusts advised by the Adviser
or its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- - Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
pre-tax investment performance of the Trusts/accounts managed by the portfolio
manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three- and five-year
periods measured against an appropriate securities market index (or indices) for
the Trusts/accounts managed by the portfolio manager. In the case of the Trust,
the Trust's investment performance is measured against the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index and against appropriate rankings or rating prepared by
Lipper Inc., Morningstar Inc. or similar independent services which monitor
Trust performance. Other Trusts/accounts managed by the same portfolio manager
may be measured against this same index and same rankings or ratings, if
appropriate, or against other indices and other rankings or ratings that are
deemed more appropriate given the size and/or style of such Trusts/accounts as
set forth in such Trusts'/accounts' disclosure materials and guidelines. The
assets managed by the portfolio managers in Trusts, pooled investment vehicles
and other accounts are described in "Other Accounts Managed by the Portfolio
Managers" above. Generally, the greatest weight is placed on the three- and
five-year periods.

- - Revenues generated by the investment companies, pooled investment vehicles and
other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

- - Contribution to the business objectives of the Adviser.

- - The dollar amount of assets managed by the portfolio manager.

- - Market compensation survey research by independent third parties.

- - Other qualitative factors, such as contributions to client objectives.

- - Performance of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and
the overall performance of the Global Investor Group, a department within Morgan
Stanley Investment Management that includes all investment professionals.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

                AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2005

I.    This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
      Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and
      each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
      President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
      performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
      forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

      -     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships.

      -     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Fund;

      -     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

      -     prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      -     accountability for adherence to the Code.

            Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST

      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

      Each Covered Officer must not:

      -     use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
            influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
            whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
            indirectly);

      -     cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
            individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
            benefit of the Fund; or

      -     use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
            contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
            trade personally or cause others to trade personally in
            contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

      Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

      Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

      -     service or significant business relationships as a director on the
            board of any public or private company;

      -     accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
            and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
            with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings,
            not including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting
            events or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

            provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
            to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
            impropriety;

      -     any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than
            its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated
            person thereof; and

      -     a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
            compensation or equity ownership.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

      -     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
            disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
            Funds;

      -     each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
            others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
            within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
            Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators and
            self-regulatory organizations;

      -     each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
            area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
            the Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting
            full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
            reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
            in other public communications made by the Funds; and

      -     it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
            laws, rules and regulations.

IV.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

      Each Covered Officer must:

      -     upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
            Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
            received, read and understands the Code;

      -     annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with
            the requirements of the Code;

      -     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or
            any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
            potential violations that are made in good faith; and

      -     notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of
            any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
            of this Code.

      The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

      The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

      -     the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
            any potential violations reported to him;

      -     if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
            violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
            any further action;

      -     any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
            reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

      -     if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
            "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
            "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
            relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will
            consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
            appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
            notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or
            its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or
            other appropriate disciplinary actions;

      -     the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
            relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
            as appropriate; and

      -     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
            be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS

      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

- ------------
(3) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

      1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen High Income
            Trust II;

      2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
            statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
            to the period covered by this report;

      3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
            information included in this report, fairly present in all material
            respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in
            net assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required
            to include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and
            for, the periods presented in this report;

      4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
            establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
            defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940)
            and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
            Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
            registrant and have:

            a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

            b)    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                  caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
                  designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable
                  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
                  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
                  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

            c)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

            d)    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
                  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                  materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

      5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
            the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
            registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
            equivalent functions):

            a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

            b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal controls over financial reporting.
