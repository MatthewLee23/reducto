Dividend Reinvestment Plans
Each Fund offers an automatic dividend reinvestment program. If Fund shares are
registered in your name and you are not already reinvesting dividends but would
like to do so, contact the dividend plan agent, Mellon Investor Services,
L.L.C., at 800 851-9677. You will be asked to put your request in writing. If
you have shares registered in "street" name, contact your financial advisor or
the broker/dealer holding the shares.

Under the current policies of Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Minnesota Municipal Income Fund I, and Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund II, all distributions of net investment income and capital
gains to common stock shareholders are automatically reinvested in additional
shares unless shareholders elect to receive all dividends and other
distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to shareholders by the
dividend plan agent. Under the current policies of Colorado Insured Municipal
Income Fund and Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, distributions of net
investment income and capital gains to common shareholders will be paid in cash
unless shareholders notify Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. of their desire to
participate in the dividend reinvestment program.

After each Fund declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gains
distribution, the plan agent will, as agent for the participants, receive the
cash payment and use it to buy shares in the open market on the American Stock
Exchange. The Funds will not issue any new shares in connection with the plan.
You can contact Mellon at:

(1)As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
   AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that required
   amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
   these changes for the year ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
   investment income per share of $0.006, a decrease in net realized and
   unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.006, and an increase in the ratio of
   net investment income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and
   ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
   this change in accounting.

(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
   the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
   each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
   the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
   based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on
   market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
   decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
   beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
   based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
   market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
   increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
   beginning to the end of such periods.

(3)Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders.

(4)Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
   shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
   applicable to common shareholders.

(5)Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6)Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
   been annualized.

Fund"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc.
("Minnesota Municipal Fund II"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income
Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund III"); Delaware Investments Arizona
Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Arizona Municipal Fund"), and Delaware Investments
Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Colorado Insured Municipal Fund")
are organized as Minnesota corporations and Delaware Investments Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund ("Florida Insured Municipal Fund") is organized as a
Massachusetts Business Trust (each referred to as a "Fund" and collectively as
the "Funds"). The Minnesota Municipal Fund II, Florida Insured Municipal Fund
and Arizona Municipal Fund are diversified closed-end management investment
companies and Minnesota Municipal Fund, Minnesota Municipal Fund III and
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund are non-diversified closed-end management
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Funds' shares trade on the American Stock Exchange.

The investment objective of each Fund is to provide high current income exempt
from federal income tax and from the personal income tax of its state, if any,
consistent with the preservation of capital. Florida Insured Municipal Fund will
generally seek investments that will enable its shares to be exempt from
Florida's intangible personal property tax. Each Fund will seek to achieve its
investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in
investment grade, tax-exempt municipal obligations of its respective state.

1. Significant Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and are consistently followed by the
Funds.

Security Valuation -- Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of the Funds' Board of
Trustees/Directors.

Federal Income Taxes -- Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.



<PAGE>

Other -- Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of
Funds are allocated amongst the Funds on the basis of average net assets.
Security transactions are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or
sold (trade date). Costs used in calculating realized gains and losses on the
sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities sold.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Discounts and premiums are
amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities. Each
Fund declares and pays dividends from net investment income monthly and
distributions from net realized gain on investments, if any, annually.

Expenses Paid Indirectly -- Certain expenses of the Funds are paid
through commission arrangements with brokers. These transactions are done
subject to best execution. In addition, the Funds may receive earnings credits
from their custodian when positive cash balances are maintained, which are used
to offset custody fees. The expenses paid under the above arrangements are
included in their respective expense captions on the Statement of Operations
with the corresponding expense offset shown as "expenses paid indirectly." The
amount of these expenses for the period ended September 30, 2003 were as
follows:

2. Investment Management, Administration Agreements and Other Transactions with
Affiliates
In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%
which is calculated daily based on the average daily net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

The Funds have engaged Delaware Service Company, Inc., (DSC), an affiliate of
DMC, to provide accounting and administration services which are based on
average net assets and paid on a monthly basis, subject to certain minimums.

At September 30, 2003, the Funds had liabilities payable to affiliates as

5. Capital Stock
Pursuant to their articles of incorporation, Minnesota Municipal Fund, Minnesota
Municipal Fund II, Minnesota Municipal Fund III, Arizona Municipal Fund and
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund each have 200 million shares of $0.01 par value
common shares authorized. Florida Insured Municipal Fund has been authorized to
issue an unlimited amount of $0.01 par value common shares. The Funds did not
repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program during the period
ending September 30, 2003. Shares issuable under the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan are purchased by the Fund's transfer agent, Mellon Investor
Services, LLC, in the open market.

For the period ended September 30, 2003, the Funds did not have any transactions
in common shares.

The Funds each have one million shares of $0.01 par value preferred shares
authorized, except for Florida Insured Municipal Fund, which has an unlimited
amount of $0.01 par value preferred shares authorized. Under resolutions adopted
by the Board of Directors/Trustees, Minnesota Municipal Fund is allowed to issue
up to 400 preferred shares, of which the entire amount was issued on August 6,
1992. On May 14, 1993, Minnesota Municipal Fund II, Arizona Municipal Fund and
Florida Insured Municipal Fund issued 1,200, 500 and 400 preferred shares,
respectively. On December 10, 1993, Minnesota Municipal Fund III issued 300
preferred shares and on September 23, 1993, Colorado Insured Municipal Fund
issued 800 preferred shares. The preferred shares of each Fund have a
liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount equal to accumulated
but unpaid dividends.

Dividends for the outstanding preferred shares of each Fund are cumulative at a
rate established at the initial public offering and are typically reset every 28
days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates (adjusted for any
capital gain distributions) ranged during the period ended September 30, 2003 as
follows:

Fund                                        Low          High
- ----                                        ---          ----
Minnesota Municipal Fund                   0.89%   to   1.22%
Minnesota Municipal Fund II                0.75%   to   1.25%
Minnesota Municipal Fund III               0.80%   to   1.20%
Arizona Municipal Fund                     0.82%   to   1.12%
Florida Insured Municipal Fund             0.80%   to   1.15%

Notes
  TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


5. Capital Stock (continued)
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.
(Colorado Insured Municipal Fund only), as the remarketing agents, receive an
annual fee from each of the Funds of 0.25% of the average amount of preferred
stock outstanding.

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class, would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant of Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

6. Credit and Market Risks
The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the state, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels of
supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment for
their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are denoted on the Statements of Net Assets.

                ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
                information; and

         (b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or

                registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's
                second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that
                has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
                affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
                reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
                which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
                ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
                information; and

         (b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
                other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
                internal control over financial reporting.
