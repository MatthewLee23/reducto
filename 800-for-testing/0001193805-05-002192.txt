MuniVest Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net
asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments,
net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the
form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the
per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to
benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped;
that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At the same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common Stock shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks
of leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. As of August 31, 2005, the percentage of the Fund's
total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 12.48%, before the deduction
of Preferred Stock.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may invest in swap agreements, which are over- the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party
with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to
pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations
to pay the other party to the agreement.

Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has tirelessly advanced its
interest rate-hiking program, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.5% by August
31 (and to 3.75% on September 20). Economists and investors have struggled to
project the Fed's future moves, vacillating from expectations for an impending
end to monetary tightening to fears that the central bank may increase interest
rates more than is necessary to moderate economic growth and keep inflation in
check. Most recently, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina added a new element
of ambiguity in terms of its impact on the economy and Fed sentiment. Many now
believe the Fed will suspend its interest rate-hiking campaign at some point
this year.

Equity market returns over the past several months have reflected a degree of
investor uncertainty. After a strong finish to 2004, the S&P 500 Index posted
gains in four of the first eight months of 2005. Up to this point, strong
corporate earnings reports and low long-term bond yields have worked in favor of
equities. Factors that pose the greatest risks to stocks include record-high oil
prices, continued interest rate hikes and the possibility for disappointing
earnings for the remainder of the year.

Fixed income markets have fared relatively well in the face of monetary
tightening. As the short end of the yield curve moved in concert with Fed
interest rate hikes, long-term bond yields remained low, perpetuating the yield
curve flattening trend. Because bond prices move in the opposite direction of
yields, the result has been that longer-term bonds have outperformed short-term
bonds. At period end, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields
was just 18 basis points (.18%).

Financial markets are likely to face continued crosscurrents for the remainder
of 2005, particularly as the economy digests the impact of Hurricane Katrina.
Nevertheless, opportunities do exist and we encourage you to work with your
financial advisor to diversify your portfolio among a variety of asset types.
This can help to diffuse risk while also tapping into the potential benefits of
a broader range of investment alternatives. As always, we thank you for trusting
Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment assets.

                                Sincerely,


                                /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      Fund performance exceeded its comparable Lipper category average for the
period, benefiting from an above-average dividend yield and positive security
selection.

Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Over the past year, long-term bond yields generally declined as their prices,
which move in the opposite direction, increased. Most recently, the devastation
of Hurricane Katrina throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast prompted a strong rally in
bond prices. The resultant higher energy prices and expected declines in
consumer confidence and spending pushed longer-term interest rates lower as the
period came to a close.

The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) continued to raise short-term interest rates
at each of its meetings during the period, lifting the federal funds target to
3.50% by period-end (and to 3.75% on September 20). As short-term interest rates
moved higher in concert with the Fed interest rate hikes and longer-term bond
yields declined, the yield curve continued to flatten. During the past 12
months, 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields declined 68 basis points (.68%) to
4.25% and 10-year Treasury note yields fell 11 basis points to 4.02%. By
comparison, the two-year Treasury yield rose 143 basis points to 3.84%.

Tax-exempt bond yields exhibited a similar pattern during the year. The yield on
30-year revenue bonds, as measured by the Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, fell 26
basis points to 4.83%. According to Municipal Market Data, the yield on
AAA-rated issues maturing in 30 years declined 48 basis points to 4.22% while
the yield on AAA-rated bonds maturing in 10 years remained unchanged at 3.50%.

Declining tax-exempt bond yields continued to encourage municipalities to issue
new debt and refund outstanding, higher-couponed issues. Over the past year,
more than $384 billion in new long-term tax-exempt bonds was issued, an increase
of greater than 7.5% versus last year's total of $357 billion. In the past six
months, more than $217 billion in new municipal bonds was underwritten, an
increase of 16.3% versus the same period in 2004. During the first six months of
2005, the volume of refunding issues increased more than 50% compared to
underwritings during the first half of 2004. In August 2005, refunding issuance
increased 18% compared to August 2004 levels. The refunding issues have been
heavily weighted in the 10-year - 20-year maturity range, putting pressure on
intermediate tax-exempt bond yields while supporting longer-term bond prices.

Investor demand for municipal product has remained generally positive. The most
current statistics from the Investment Company Institute indicate that,
year-to-date through July 31, 2005, net new cash flows into long-term municipal
bond funds have exceeded $4.2 billion -- a significant improvement from the
$12.4 billion net outflow seen during the same period in 2004. Weekly figures
for August, as reported by AMG Data Service, pointed to continued positive
flows.

Notably, throughout much of the past six months, high yield tax-exempt bond
funds have been the principal target for the new cash inflows. During August,
these lower-rated/non-rated bond funds received an average of $150 million per
week. The need to invest these cash flows has led to strong demand for
lower-rated issues and a consequent narrowing of credit spreads. Additionally,
an increasing percentage of insured issuance has further reduced the
availability of lower-rated municipal securities, lending more support to higher
prices for these issues.

Municipal bond issues have underperformed their taxable counterparts in recent
months as U.S. Treasury bonds have enjoyed increased demand from foreign
governments, which are unable to benefit from the tax advantage inherent in
tax-exempt products. This underperformance, however, has resulted in attractive
tax-exempt bond yield ratios and, we believe, should continue to attract both
traditional and nontraditional investors to the municipal marketplace.

The communities shattered by Hurricane Katrina will require extensive
reconstruction. It is too early to estimate the amount of tax-exempt debt that
may be required to finance these efforts or to assess the overall impact on the
municipal market. However, much of the rebuilding is likely to be funded through
federal loans and grants, and the reconstruction will probably be spread over a
number of years. Consequently, any municipal bond issuance prompted by Katrina
is not likely to disrupt the tax-exempt market in the near future.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the 12-month period ended August 31, 2005, the Common Stock of MuniVest
Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 6.57% and 6.62%, based on a year-end per
share net asset value of $10.23 and a per share market price of $10.15,
respectively, and $.672 per share income dividends.


4                  MUNIVEST FUND, INC.     AUGUST 31, 2005
<PAGE>

Over the same period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was
+10.64%, based on a change in per share net asset value from $9.91 to $10.23,
and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the +9.74% average
return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for the
12-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in municipal
debt issues rated in the top four credit-rating categories. These funds can be
leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse repurchase
agreements.) The Fund outperformed despite its generally defensive market
posture in an environment where long-term interest rates declined. Benefiting
performance was the Fund's above-average dividend yield, continued strong price
performance from its lower-rated holdings, and positive security selection.
Recently, performance also has been aided by the refunding of a large portion of
the Fund's tobacco-related holdings and significant price improvement in its
California bonds.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2005, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +4.91%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $10.09 to $10.23, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the American Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

The demand for securities rated BBB and below has remained quite strong,
resulting in ongoing price appreciation for these issues. We expect the demand
for higher-yielding bonds to remain positive in the near term. However, given
the magnitude of the recent price appreciation, we intend to closely monitor
these lower-rated holdings and will look to increase the Fund's overall credit
quality profile should attractively priced, higher-rated securities become
available.

As the fiscal period progressed, we increased the portfolio's exposure to more
interest rate-sensitive issues and moved the Fund to a more neutral market
position. We made this shift as the Fed appears to be nearing the end of its
monetary tightening campaign, and it does not seem likely that long-term
interest rates will rise significantly.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2005, the Fund's Auction Market
Preferred Stock (AMPS) had average yields as follows: Series A, 2.42%; Series B,
2.06%; Series C, 2.17%; Series D, 2.46%; Series E, 2.18%; and Series F, 2.28%.
Continued short-term interest rate increases by the Fed have boosted the Fund's
borrowing costs throughout the 12-month period. Although we believe the majority
of the Fed's actions have already occurred, additional interest rate hikes are
expected until at least year-end. Nevertheless, the Fund's borrowing costs have
remained historically very low, and the leveraging of Preferred Stock has
continued to generate an income benefit to the holders of Common Stock. However,
should the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the
benefits of leverage will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the
Fund's Common Stock. At the end of the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due
to AMPS, was 34.73% of total net assets. (For a more complete explanation of the
benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 2 of this report to shareholders.)

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We ended the period with a more neutral posture in terms of interest rate risk.
The Fed is believed to be nearing the end of its current monetary tightening
cycle, and inflationary pressures remain well contained. In the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina, U.S. economic growth will likely slow in the near term,
thereby supporting higher long-term bond prices in the months ahead. Amid these
conditions, we have positioned the Fund to perform well in stable to declining
interest rate environments. In addition, we intend to maintain the Fund's fully
invested stance in an effort to enhance shareholder income.

Special Message to Shareholders

A Municipal Bonds Update in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina caused tremendous human suffering, and the total damage
estimates are currently ranging as high as $200 billion, making it the worst
natural disaster to hit the United States. Despite the widespread devastation
from the storm, we believe that there should be no long-term negative effect on
the credit ratings of state and local governments in Louisiana, Mississippi and
Alabama. It is our view that the affected states should recover with no major
long-term financial or economic damage. These states possess broad-based
economies outside of the areas suffering hurricane destruction, and, as
sovereign entities, maintain the exclusive right to collect a broad array of tax
revenues.

Given the extent of the damage from the hurricane, the local entities most
heavily affected, including New Orleans, Biloxi and Mobile, could possibly face
credit rating downgrades in the near term due to constrained financial
operations resulting from reduced economic activity and short-term cash flow
disruptions. However, we do not view any credit deterioration as a long-term
trend and believe these areas also will recover. Like states, these
municipalities retain strong revenue-raising abilities, particularly property
and sales taxes, and also can reduce expenses.

The region's recovery likely will be aided by an injection of revenues in the
form of federal emergency aid, private insurance and charitable contributions.
However, given the severity of the damage from Hurricane Katrina, it is
difficult to predict the length of recovery and the amount and timing of
additional federal aid or claims paid by private municipal bond insurers. Many
public entities have issued insured debt, for which private insurers guarantee
timely payment of principal and interest. This especially benefits holders of
bonds secured by more economically sensitive revenues, such as hotel and sales
taxes, which are expected to slow significantly in the short term. We do not
foresee any widespread or prolonged debt service defaults. The few defaults that
may occur should be temporary in nature, and we believe there will be a complete
recovery over a short period of time.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S
generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol MVF. The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price
in the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general direction
of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures contracts
and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing
prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are
valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In the
case of options traded in the OTC market, valuation is the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements are
valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Fund's pricing service.
Short-term investments with a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market value, under which method the
investment is valued at cost and any premium or discount is amortized on a
straight line basis to maturity. Investments in open-end investment companies
are valued at their net asset value each business day. Securities and other
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
      Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund
      is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the
      liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market
      value of the option written. When a security is purchased or sold through
      an exercise of an option, the related premium paid (or received) is added
      to (or deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
      (or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires
      (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain
      or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or
      gain or loss to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the
      premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

(d) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(f) Offering costs -- Direct expenses relating to the public offering of the
Fund's Preferred Stock were charged to capital.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at
an annual rate of .50% of the Fund's average daily net assets, including assets
acquired from the sale of Preferred Stock. The Investment Adviser has agreed to
waive its management fee by the amount of management fees the Fund pays to FAM
indirectly through its investment in the Merrill Lynch Institutional Tax-Exempt
Fund. For the year ended August 31, 2005, FAM reimbursed the Fund in the amount
of $13,941.

In addition, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S")
received $6,895 in commissions on the execution of portfolio security
transactions for the Fund for the year ended August 31, 2005.

For the year ended August 31, 2005, the Fund reimbursed FAM $21,532 for certain
accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, PSI, and/or ML & Co.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the
year ended August 31, 2005, were $575,045,625 and $550,194,675 respectively.

4. Capital Stock Transactions:

Common Stock

At August 31, 2005, the Fund had one class of shares of Common Stock, par value
$.10 per share, of which 150,000,000 shares were authorized.

Preferred Stock

Auction Market Preferred Stock are redeemable shares of Preferred Stock of the
Fund with a par value of $.025 per share and a liquidation preference of $25,000
per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, that entitle their holders to
receive cash dividends at an annual rate that may vary for the successive
dividend periods for each series. The Fund is authorized to issue 10,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock. The yields in effect at August 31, 2005 were as
follows: Series A, 2.41%; Series B, 2.25%; Series C, 2.30%; Series D, 2.469%;
Series E, 2.40%; and Series F, 2.40%.

Shares issued and outstanding for the year ended August 31, 2005 remained
constant. During the year ended August 31, 2004, shares increased by 2,360
shares from the issuance of an additional series of Preferred Stock.

The Fund pays commissions to certain broker-dealers at the end of each auction
at an annual rate ranging from .25% to .375% calculated on the proceeds of each
auction. For the year ended August 31, 2005, MLPF&S received $396,709 as
commissions.

5. Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund paid a tax-exempt income dividend to holders of Common Stock in the
amount of $.056000 per share on September 29, 2005 to shareholders of record on
September 14, 2005.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended August 31,
2005 and August 31, 2004 was as follows:

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

As of August 31, 2005, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

*     On August 31, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $20,303,047, of which $2,623,164 expires in 2008 and $17,679,883 expires
      in 2009. This amount will be available to offset like amounts of any
      future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized gains is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      tax deferral of losses on straddles, and the difference between book and
      tax amortization methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income
      securities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
MuniVest Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets, including the schedule
of investments, of MuniVest Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2005, and the related
statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of August 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
MuniVest Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2005, the results of its operations for the
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The following description of the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required by federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock otherwise elects,
all dividend and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested by
The Bank of New York (the "Plan Agent"), as agent for shareholders in
administering the Plan, in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund.
Holders of Common Stock who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of
record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name then to such
nominee) by The Bank of New York, as dividend paying agent. Such participants
may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive all distributions of
dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to The Bank
of New York, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by written notice if received by the Plan
Agent not less than ten days prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
termination will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend
or distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares an income dividend or capital gains distribution
(collectively referred to as "dividends") payable either in shares or in cash,
non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be acquired by
the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon the circumstances
described below, either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of Common Stock from the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii)
by purchase of outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market
("open-market purchases") on the American Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on
the payment date for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the Common
Stock is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common Stock
plus estimated brokerage commissions (such conditions being referred to herein
as "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly
issued shares on behalf of the participant. The number of newly issued shares of
Common Stock to be credited to the participant's account will be determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
current market price per share on the date of issuance may not exceed 5%. If, on
the dividend payment date, the net asset value per share is greater than the
market value (such condition being referred to herein as "market discount"), the
Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the
participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the Plan Agent
will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no event more than 30 days after the
dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest the dividend amount
in shares acquired in open-market purchases. It is contemplated that the Fund
will pay monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which
open-market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date on the
dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date, which typically
will be approximately 10 days. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
open-market purchases, the market price of a share of Common Stock exceeds the
net asset value per share, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan
Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisitions of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in newly issued
shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to open-market purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is
unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the
purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market purchases and will
invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at
the close of business on the last purchase date determined by dividing the
uninvested portion of the dividend by the net asset value per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all
proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold shares
of others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan
on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (concluded)

the record shareholders as representing the total amount registered in the
record shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are
to participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the
Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains distributions payable either in
shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not available to
shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the market price plus commissions
of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants in the Plan will
receive shares of the Fund at less than they could otherwise purchase them and
will have shares with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market price plus
commissions is below the net asset value, participants will receive
distributions in shares with a net asset value greater than the value of any
cash distribution they would have received on their shares. However, there may
be insufficient shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be excluded
from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would be
excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a premium
over net asset value, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a
greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible
that all or a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the fair
market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable distribution. If
the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also possible that the
taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all the shareholders,
including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders
who do not participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary
income a portion of their distributions equal to their allocable share of the
discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right
to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
The Bank of New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY
10286-1258, Telephone: 800-432-8224.

Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which
comprises part of the financial information included in this report.

         The nature of the services include assurance and related services
         reasonably related to the performance of the audit of financial
         statements not included in Audit Fees.

         (c) Tax Fees -           Fiscal Year Ending August 31, 2005 - $7,000

         planning.

         (d) All Other Fees -     Fiscal Year Ending August 31, 2005 - $0
                                  Fiscal Year Ending August 31, 2004 - $0

         (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
         Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
         registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
         Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
         provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to the
         registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly to the
         operations and the financial reporting of the registrant. Certain of
         these non-audit services that the Committee believes are a) consistent
         with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b) routine and recurring
         services that will not impair the independence of the independent
         accountants may be approved by the Committee without consideration on a
         specific case-by-case basis ("general pre-approval"). However, such
         services will only be deemed pre-approved provided that any individual
         project does not exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or
         $50,000 for all of the registrants the Committee oversees. Any proposed
         services exceeding the pre-approved cost levels will require specific
         pre-approval by the Committee, as will any other services not subject
         to general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).
         The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
         pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board meeting.

         ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant
         to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible

Item 7 - Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
         Management Investment Companies -
         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that the Investment Adviser considers
         the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not the
         interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that real
         (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Investment
         Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's clients are
         properly addressed and resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a
         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except
         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested

<PAGE>

         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting
         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

<PAGE>

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I, Robert C. Doll, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of MuniVest Fund, Inc., certify
that:

      1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of MuniVest Fund, Inc.;

      2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
            statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
            to the period covered by this report;

      3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
            information included in this report, fairly present in all material
            respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in
            net assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required
            to include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and
            for, the periods presented in this report;

      4.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible
            for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
            (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of
            1940) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
            Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
            registrant and have:

            a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

            b)    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                  caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
                  designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable
                  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
                  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
                  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

<PAGE>

            c)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

            d)    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
                  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                  materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

      5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
            the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
            registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
            equivalent functions):

            a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

            b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
