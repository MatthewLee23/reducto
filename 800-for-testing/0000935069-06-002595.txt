                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    ORGANIZATION

      UBS Technology Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a
      limited  partnership  under the laws of Delaware on December  28, 1998 and
      was  subsequently  reorganized as a limited  liability  company  effective
      October 15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment  Company Act
      of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,
      management  investment  company.  The Fund's  investment  objective  is to
      maximize  capital  appreciation  over the long-term.  The Fund pursues its
      investment  objective by  deploying  its assets  primarily  among a select
      group  of  portfolio  managers  who  invest  primarily  in,  or  who  have
      particular  knowledge  within,  the  technology  sector.  Generally,  such
      portfolio managers conduct their investment programs through  unregistered
      investment funds (collectively,  the "Investment Funds") in which the Fund
      invests as a limited  partner or member  along with other  investors.  The
      Fund commenced operations on April 1, 1999.

      The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall responsibility
      to manage and  control the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
      exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies  regarding  the
      management,  conduct and operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
      have  engaged UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "UBSFA" or  "Manager"),  a
      Delaware limited liability company and the Manager of the Fund, to provide
      investment  advice  regarding the selection of Investment  Funds and to be
      responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

      The Manager is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
      which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG, and is  registered  as an
      investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

      Initial and additional  applications  for interests by eligible  investors
      may be  accepted  at such  times  as the  Manager  may  determine  and are
      generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund  reserves  the right to reject any
      application for interests in the Fund.

      The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to
      written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such times
      and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete
      and exclusive  discretion.  The Manager  expects that  generally,  it will
      recommend to the  Directors  that the Fund offer to  repurchase  interests
      from Members twice in each year,  near mid-year and year-end.  Members can
      only transfer or assign their membership interests,  or a portion thereof,
      (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency or
      dissolution  of a  Member,  or  (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of the
      Directors,  which may be withheld in their sole and  absolute  discretion.
      Such  transfers may be made even if the balance of the capital  account to
      such transferee is equal to or less than the transferor's  initial capital
      contribution.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

      Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction of the
      Manager as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
      accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set forth  below or as may be
      determined  from time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
      Directors.


                                                                               5

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      The Fund's  investments  in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms and
      conditions of the respective  operating agreements and offering memoranda,
      as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are carried at
      fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets
      of each  Investment  Fund. All valuations  utilize  financial  information
      supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
      incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
      pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The  Fund's  valuation
      procedures  require  the  Manager to  consider  all  relevant  information
      available at the time the Fund values its  portfolio.  The Manager  and/or
      the Board  will  consider  such  information  and  consider  whether it is
      appropriate,  in  light of all  relevant  circumstances,  to value  such a
      position  at its net asset  value as  reported  or whether to adjust  such
      value.  The underlying  investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted
      for at fair  value  as  described  in  each  Investment  Fund's  financial
      statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments)

      Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment  Funds,  whether in
      the form of cash or  securities,  are first  applied as a reduction of the
      investment's cost.

      B.    INCOME RECOGNITION

      Interest  income is  recorded  on the accrual  basis.  Realized  gains and
      losses from Investment Fund  transactions are calculated on the identified
      cost basis.

      C.    FUND COSTS

      The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including,  but not
      limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to portfolio
      transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees; accounting
      and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
      value; costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
      costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;  expenses of
      meetings  of   Directors   and   Members;   all  costs  with   respect  to
      communications  to Members;  and other  types of expenses  approved by the
      Directors. Syndication costs are charged to capital as incurred.

      D.    INCOME TAXES

      No provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
      been provided, since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
      individually  required  to report on its own tax return  its  distributive
      share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.


                                                                               6

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      E.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

      Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank,  NA
      account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted for at cost plus
      accrued interest which is included in interest receivable on the Statement
      of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      F.    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

      From  time to time,  the Fund may enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
      connection  with  such  transactions  it is the  Fund's  policy  that  its
      custodian take  possession of the underlying  collateral  securities,  the
      fair  value  of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount  of the  repurchase
      transaction,  including  accrued  interest,  at all  times.  If the seller
      defaults,  and the fair value of the collateral  declines,  realization of
      the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. As of June 30, 2006,
      there were no open repurchase agreements.

      G.    USE OF ESTIMATES

      The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
      and accompanying  notes. The Manager believes that the estimates  utilized
      in preparing the Fund's  financial  statements are reasonable and prudent;
      however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      UBSFA provides certain management and administrative services to the Fund,
      including,  among other things,  providing  office space and other support
      services.  In  consideration  for such  services,  the Fund  pays  UBSFA a
      monthly  management  fee (the "UBSFA  Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of the
      Fund's net assets,  excluding assets attributable to the Manager's capital
      account.  The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's  assets  and  debited
      against the Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding the Manager's  capital
      account. A portion of the fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

      UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
      Americas,  Inc., acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
      compensation  from the Fund, and bears its own costs  associated  with its
      activities  as  placement  agent.  Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
      contributions are debited against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a
      net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute assets of
      the Fund.

      The net increase (or decrease) in members' capital derived from operations
      (net income or loss) is initially allocated to the capital accounts of all
      Members  on a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than the Fee  which  is  similarly
      allocated  to all Members  other than the Manager as described  above.  In
      accordance with the Limited  Liability Company  Agreement,  the Manager is
      then  allocated  an  amount  based on the  performance  of the  Fund  (the
      "Performance Bonus") for the Measurement Period, as defined in the


                                                                               7

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

      Confidential Memorandum (i.e., the period commencing on the admission of a
      Member to the Fund,  and  thereafter  each  period  commencing  on the day
      following the last Measurement Period and ending generally on the first to
      occur of (1) a fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial  redemption.  The
      Performance Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

      The  Performance  Bonus  is  equal to 1% of the  balance  of the  Member's
      capital  account  at the  end of the  Measurement  Period,  provided  that
      appreciation  in the  Member's  capital  account  (net of any  Performance
      Bonus) exceeds the Member's  threshold return. The threshold return is the
      amount  that a  Member  would  have  earned  for a  fiscal  year if it had
      received  an  annualized  rate of  return  of 20% on its  opening  capital
      account  balance,  as adjusted.  No  Performance  Bonus was earned for the
      period from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006.

      Each  Director  of the Fund  receives a retainer  of $7,500 plus a fee for
      each meeting  attended.  All Directors are  reimbursed by the Fund for all
      reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed by the Fund
      related to Directors  for the period from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006
      were $14,410, included in miscellaneous on the Statements of Operations.

4.    ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

      PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as custodian (the
      "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial services for the
      Fund.

      PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as Administrator  and
      Accounting  Agent  to the  Fund  and in  that  capacity  provides  certain
      administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax and  investor  related
      services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the
      average net assets of the Fund, subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii)
      the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
      sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or it affiliates. Additionally,
      the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

5.    CREDIT FACILITY

      Effective  July 1, 2005, the Fund,  along with other UBS sponsored  funds,
      entered into a $150,000,000 committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
      with  Harris  Trust  and  Savings   Bank.   Under  the  most   restrictive
      arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount that  combined  with the other
      borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's
      borrowing  capacity  is also  limited to the portion of the unused line of
      credit at any  point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under the line of
      credit to the extent of its own borrowing  there under.  The interest rate
      on the  borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus 150 basis points
      per annum. The expiration date of such credit agreements is June 30, 2006.
      The  committed  facility  also requires a fee to be paid by the Fund, on a
      pro-rata basis, based on the amount of the aggregate  commitment which has
      not been utilized of 25 basis points per annum.  As of June 30, 2006,  and
      for the  period  from  January 1, 2006 to June 30,  2006,  the Fund has no
      outstanding borrowings.


                                                                               8

      respectively.

      The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax purposes is adjusted for

      The  allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the  Investment
      Funds on Schedules K-1.

      compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of management
      fees of 1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance  incentive fees
      or allocations of 20% of net profits earned.  The Investment Funds provide
      for  periodic  redemptions,  with lock up  provisions  ranging up to three
      years from initial investment.  Detailed  information about the Investment
      Funds' portfolios is not available.

8.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

      In the normal course of business,  the Investment  Funds in which the Fund
      invests  trade  various  financial  instruments  and  enter  into  various
      investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
      not  limited to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
      contracts for  differences,  and equity swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
      these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these  investments  as
      reported by the Fund.

9.    INDEMNIFICATION

      In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts or
      agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future events
      could occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against the
      Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels the likelihood
      of such an event is remote.

  a.  Ratio of total  expenses to average net assets does not include the impact
      of expenses for  incentive  allocations  or incentive  fees related to the
      underlying Investment Funds.

   *  Annualized.

  **  Total  return  assumes  a  purchase  of an  interest  in the  Fund  at the
      beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund interest on the last day of
      the period noted and does not reflect the deduction of placement  fees, if
      any,  incurred when subscribing to the Fund. Total returns for a period of
      less than a full year are not  annualized.  An individual  member's ratios
      and  return  may vary from the above  based on  incentive  allocation,  if
      applicable,  and the  timing of  capital  transactions.

 ***  Total  return  assumes  a  purchase  of an  interest  in the  Fund  at the
      beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund interest on the last day of
      the period noted,  after  Performance  Bonus to the Manager,  and does not
      reflect the deduction of placement fees, if any, incurred when subscribing
      to the Fund.  Total  returns for a period of less than a full year are not
      annualized.

****  The average net assets used in the above ratios are  calculated  by adding
      any withdrawals payable effective at the end of a period to the net assets
      for such period.

11.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

      Effective  July 1, 2006, the Fund,  along with other UBS sponsored  funds,

      of such credit agreement is July 31, 2007.
