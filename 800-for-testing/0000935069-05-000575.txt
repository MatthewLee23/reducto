THERE ARE THREE CLOSED-END FUNDS INVESTING IN EUROPEAN EQUITIES MANAGED BY
WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK GROUP:

o  The Germany  Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily  in  equities of major  German
   corporations.  It may also  invest  up to 20% in  equities  of other  Western
   European companies (with no more than 15% in any single country).

o  The New Germany Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in the middle market German
   companies and up to 20% elsewhere in Western Europe (with no more than 10% in
   any single country).

o  The Central  Europe and Russia  Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily  in Central

These  funds  are  not  diversified  and  focus  their  investments  in  certain
geographical regions,  thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments,  such as currency  fluctuation,  political
and economic  changes,  and market risks. This may result in greater share price
volatility.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                February 4, 2005
   Dear Shareholders,

   For the fiscal year ended  December 31,  2004,  the total return based on net
asset  value  per  share  of The  Germany  Fund was  12.58%,  while  the  fund's
benchmark,  the DAX Index,  increased  by 15.91%  during the same  period 1. The
fund's total return based on its share price was 7.25% in USD terms.  Please see
page 2 for the fund's standardized performance as of December 31, 2004.

   The  year  2004  is  marked  as  one of  the  best  years  of  global  growth
historically,  although  energy  prices put a damper on the strong upturn in the
second half of 2004.  The United States and the  emerging-market  economies will
likely remain the main engines of growth in 2005,  while  Euroland will continue
to   lag.   In   2004   German   gross   domestic    product   (GDP)   grew   in
nonworking-day-adjusted  terms by 1.7% year-over-year,  the strongest rate since
2000. The main pillar of growth was export industries,  but the domestic economy
also contributed slightly to overall GDP growth in 2004. Consumption was again a
drag on overall growth, as private consumption failed to rise for the third year
in a row. But  investment  in machinery and  equipment  rose in 2004.  Corporate
profits have also developed  favorably,  and the ratio between corporate profits
and  investment  in machinery and  equipment  has risen  significantly  to a new
all-time high in the last few quarters.  In the past, such a development usually
pointed to dynamic growth in investment.  Despite a real effective exchange rate
appreciation in 2004, German companies lost almost no export market share, which
is a good  indication  of their  strong  competitiveness.  According  to  German
economics  minister  Clement,  the economic recovery could broaden and deepen in
2005. His optimism is supported by relatively positive survey data on the German
economy,  which  has  boosted  public  sentiment  about the  country's  economic
prospects.

   A large part of The Germany Fund's underperformance relative to its benchmark
occurred in the second quarter,  due to the fund's cyclical exposure to Deutsche
Lufthansa  and  Infineon  Technologies.  In the case of Deutsche  Lufthansa,  an
unexpected  capital  increase weighed on the stock in addition to the strong oil
price.  While the outlook for the semiconductor  industry seemed to be favorable
at the  beginning  of the  year,  reports  about  weaker  DRAM chip  prices  and
lackluster  spending in consumer  electronics  caused  Infineon  Technologies to
contribute negatively to the fund's performance. Meanwhile, the fund had limited
exposure to the defensive  utilities  sector,  which performed well in the first
half of 2004.

   We are  continuing  to position  The Germany  Fund to take  advantage  of the
expected  ongoing  economic  recovery as well as our expectation that the global
economy will  continue its current  growth path well into 2005.  We believe that
quality and financial strength combined with growth  opportunities should be key
factors of success.  The year 2005 will  likely be  dominated  by share  buyback
programs and dividend  increases.  Also,  mergers and  acquisitions  should be a
major theme due to strong cash-flow  generation.  As a result, the fund recently
added to its  telecommunications  sector  by  purchasing  Deutsche  Telekom  and
Telefonica.

   The fund continued its  open-market  purchases of its shares,  buying 652,150
shares during the fiscal year.  The Germany  Fund's  discount to net asset value
averaged  12.43% for the year ended December 31, 2004,  compared with 11.34% for
the previous fiscal year.

Investments in funds involve risk including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified  and primarily  focuses its investments in Germany,
thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country.  Investing
in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic
investments, such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes and
market risks. This may result in greater share price volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the Fund.  Therefore,  the Fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

The  Fund  has  elected  to  not  be  subject  to  the  statutory   calculation,
notification  and  publication  requirements  of the German  Investment  Tax Act
(Investmentsteuergesetz).  As a  result  German  investors  in the  Fund  may be
subject to less favorable lump-sum taxation under German law.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   QUESTION:  GERMAN  ECONOMIC GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO LAG THE REST OF EUROPE THIS
YEAR. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR INVESTORS TO PUT THEIR MONEY IN GERMANY?

   ANSWER:  Although  Germany is expected to grow at a slower rate than the rest
of Europe in 2005,  there are signs that the  economic  situation  in Germany is
stabilizing. For example, retail sales finally returned to positive territory at
the end of 2004,  indicating  that  domestic  demand  may  pick up in  2005.  In
addition,  the ZEW index,  which  measures  economic  growth  expectations,  has
recently reversed its downward trend, signaling increased optimism. Nonetheless,
the overall economic picture for Germany remains mixed.  However,  global growth
is expected  to continue at a strong pace this year and, as the world's  leading
exporter,  Germany stands to continue benefiting  from this growth. 1 With often
more than 50% of their revenues  coming from overseas,  German  companies  offer
investors an effective means to reap the benefits of strong global growth.  This
is evidenced by the fact that, despite modest domestic economic performance, the
German  markets  performed  well relative to other markets last year,  finishing
2004 at the highs of the year.

   QUESTION:  YOU MENTIONED  GERMANY'S POSITION AS THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPORTER.
WHICH SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY'S  EXPORT-DRIVEN  ECONOMY WILL BE AFFECTED THE MOST
BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS OF THE DOLLAR?

   ANSWER: German companies lost almost no export market share in 2004 despite a
3.8%  appreciation  of the real  effective  exchange  rate.  While the continued
appreciation  of the euro in 2005 may finally begin to affect German  companies,
this impact will be limited due to the fact that more than 40% of German exports
remain within the Eurozone.  While  potential  effects vary even within sectors,
depending on an individual company's currency exposure, the automotive sector is
likely  to be  the  most  negatively  affected  by  continued  dollar  weakness.
Chemicals,  pharmaceuticals  and  industrials  may also be  adversely  affected.
Consumer retail  companies,  on the other hand, are  well-positioned  to benefit
from the weaker  dollar.  In  particular,  companies that produce goods in Asian
countries  with  dollar-pegged  currencies  will benefit from reduced  operating
expenses.

   QUESTION: THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE LATEST PHASE OF ITS LABOR-MARKET
REFORMS ON JANUARY 1, 2005.  HOW  QUICKLY  ARE THE  REFORMS  EXPECTED TO HAVE AN
IMPACT ON UNEMPLOYMENT, WHICH ROSE AGAIN IN 2004?

   ANSWER: The goal of the German  government's Hartz IV labor-market  reform is
to encourage unemployed citizens to re-enter the workforce. As part of the plan,
unemployment  and welfare  benefits  have been  combined  into a single  benefit
category, effectively reducing the number of people eligible to receive benefits
and thereby providing an incentive for those people to find jobs. Changes in the
criteria for who is counted as unemployed  under the new program are expected to
have a negative  short-term  effect on  unemployment  figures.  For  example,  a
significant  number of welfare  recipients  who were not  previously  counted as
unemployed will now be counted as such. Thus, unemployment figures for the early
part  of 2005  could  increase  to  around  5  million,  though  this  will  not
necessarily reflect a real deterioration in the labor market. In addition, a new
measure of German  unemployment  will be  released  by the  Federal  Statistical
Office  beginning in March 2005 that should  conform to standards of measurement
currently used in the United States. The new statistic is expected to describe a
lower level of unemployment  than the current  government  figures  reflect.  In
summary,  2005 will be a transition year for the German labor market in terms of
both data measurement and real progress toward reducing unemployment.  While the
reforms are not  expected to produce a  significant  reduction  in  unemployment
levels this year, they should gain traction as the year progresses.

   QUESTION:  GERMANY HAS CONTINUALLY  EXCEEDED THE 3% OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
(GDP) BUDGET  DEFICIT LIMIT  IMPOSED ON EUROPEAN  UNION MEMBER STATES AS PART OF
THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT MEMBER STATES MAY FAIL
TO REIN IN THE  BUDGET  DEFICIT  AGAIN IN 2005.  WHAT ARE THE  RAMIFICATIONS  IF
GERMANY DOES NOT RECTIFY THIS SITUATION?

   ANSWER:  In  theory,  a fine of not more than  0.5% of GDP per year  could be
levied for  failure to meet this  provision  of the pact.  However,  a number of
steps must occur before a fine can be imposed. First, the Commission must notify
the member  state that it has an excessive  deficit  (Germany was so notified in
January  2003)  and  recommend  corrective  actions  for  the  member  state  to
undertake.  The  Commission  subsequently  reviews the  situation  to  determine
whether the government has taken  sufficient steps to address its deficit level.
If the  Commission  decides  that the member  state has failed to take  adequate
corrective  measures,  the  member  state  may be  sanctioned  in the  form of a
non-interest-bearing  deposit. The member state has two years from that point to
correct the excessive  deficit.  On December 14, 2004, the Commission  concluded
that  Germany has taken  action to correct its  excessive  deficit by 2005,  and
therefore, no movement to impose sanctions has been taken at this time.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

   In 2005, the pace of growth looks set to be similar to that in 2004.  Despite
recent concerns that German  economic  growth will slow in 2005,  Germany is not
expected to fall back into  stagnation.  Rather,  gross  domestic  product (GDP)
growth is likely to consolidate at a low level. The economic environment will be
more  challenging  than in 2004,  as the world  economy  will  likely  slow down
somewhat in 2005 and the euro should  continue to appreciate.  These two factors
will probably  hamper the  contribution  to domestic  growth of German  exports,
which had a banner year in 2004,  rising 10% and  boosting the  country's  trade
surplus to a record high.

   In contrast to 2004,  contributions from the domestic economy and net exports
will be more  balanced,  as domestic  demand is poised to  contribute  a greater
share of GDP growth in 2005. Overall,  disposable income could grow 1.3% in 2005
(just as in 2004). As inflation  seems likely to slow,  real  disposable  income
growth should  accelerate to 0.8%,  up from 0.2% in 2004.  Private  consumption,
which  declined  for the  third  straight  year in  2004,  is  expected  to rise
moderately this year and should be boosted by a reduced tax rate.

   Investment  in machinery  and  equipment  was up  significantly  in the third
quarter  of 2004  (4.1%  quarter-on-quarter).  The phase of  weakness  since the
fourth quarter of 2001 seems to have ended, as there are some signs of continued
growth in  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment  in the next few  quarters.
Corporate profits have developed favorably, growing at a non-seasonally adjusted
rate of 10.7% in 2004.  With data on industrial  capital stock  suggesting  that
there is significant need of replacement  investment,  corporate  profits should
enable such spending.  Taking into account an expected  decline in  construction
investment,  overall  investment may rise by as much as 2.4% year-on-year due to
the favorable trend in investment in machinery and equipment.

   At its first  meeting  of the year,  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB) kept
interest rates  unchanged at 2%. We believe that rates will remain stable in the
coming months and that the next rate move will be a hike.  In our view,  the ECB
is  likely  to begin  raising  rates by 0.25%  per  quarter  later in the  year,
ultimately aiming for a more neutral rate of 3% by mid-2006.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

   The observations in this letter reflect our own opinions and are based on our
own analysis,  and others may have different opinions.  Events may not transpire
as we or they currently expect.  Also, while economic events can influence broad
market trends, political,  monetary and other factors are also relevant to stock
performance.  In any event,  investment  results  will  depend on our success in
identifying  individual  stocks,  which are  influenced  by many factors  beyond
general economic matters.  We cannot predict  investment results or whether they
will be successful.

THE GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Germany  Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated  in Delaware on April 8,
1986 as a diversified,  closed-end  management  investment  company.  Investment
operations  commenced on July 23, 1986. The Fund  reincorporated  in Maryland on
August 29, 1990 and on October 16, 1996 the Fund changed from a diversified to a
non-diversified company.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange  prevailing on the respective  settlement  dates of such
transactions.  The  resultant  gains  and  losses  arising  from  exchange  rate
fluctuations  are identified  separately in the Statement of Operations,  except
for such amounts  attributable to investments which are included in net realized
and unrealized gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts  that  contain a variety  of  representations  which  provide  general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown as this would  involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience,  the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

At  December  31,  2004,  the  Fund's   components  of  distributable   earnings
(accumulated  losses) on a tax-basis were as follows:  Capital loss carryforward
$(45,332,000)  Net  unrealized  appreciation  $ 35,399,465 In addition,  the tax
character of  distributions  paid to  shareholders  by the Fund is summarized as
follows:

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
        ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

The Fund had a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager").  At its July 12, 2004 Board meeting, the Board approved transferring
the Fund's  management  agreement  with  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  to an
affiliated company,  Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. The transfer,
which became effective September 1, 2004, does not involve any change in control
or actual  management  of the  investment  manager,  which will provide the same
scope of  services,  will  utilize the same people for work on Fund  matters and
will  charge  the same fees  under  the  agreement.  The Fund has an  Investment
Advisory  Agreement  with  Deutsche  Asset  Management  International  GmbH (the
"Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the  Investment  Adviser are affiliated
companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $50 million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $50 million. The
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides  the  Investment  Adviser  with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100 million. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2004, the combined
fee pursuant to the Management and Investment Advisory Agreements was equivalent
to an annualized effective rate of .93% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser, in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objectives,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders,  and selects  brokers and dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions on
behalf of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

For the year ended December 31, 2004, Deutsche Bank AG, the German parent of the
Manager  and  Investment  Adviser,  and  its  affiliates  received  $105,634  in
brokerage  commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio
securities  on behalf of the Fund,  that the Board  determined  were effected in
compliance with the Fund's Rule 17e-1 procedures.

The Fund paid insurance  premiums to an unaffiliated  insurance  broker in 2003.
This broker in turn paid a portion of its  commissions  to an  affiliate  of the
Manager,  which performed certain insurance  brokerage  services for the broker.
The  Manager  has  agreed  to  reimburse  the  Fund in 2005 for the  portion  of
commissions (plus interest) paid to the affiliate of the Manager attributable to
the premiums paid by the Fund. The amount for 2003 was $63.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the  Investment  Adviser fully  reimbursed
the Fund $8,794 for a trading error that occurred during the fiscal year.

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for the year  ended  December  31,  2004  were  $252,075,684  and  $253,338,371,
respectively.

The cost of investments at December 31, 2004 was  $103,730,243 for United States
Federal  income  tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  as  of  December  31,  2004,  net
unrealized   appreciation  of  investments   aggregated   $35,399,465  of  which
$35,584,014 and $184,549 related to unrealized  appreciation  and  depreciation,
respectively.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward at December 31, 2004 of approximately $45,332,000,  of which $13,630,000
and  $31,702,000  will expire in 2009 and 2010,  respectively.  No capital gains
distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders  until future net gains have
been  realized in excess of such carry  forward.  In addition,  from November 1,
2004 to December  31,  2004,  the Fund  incurred  approximately  $220,000 of net
realized capital losses.  As permitted by tax  regulations,  the Fund intends to
elect to defer  these  losses and treat them as arising in the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

As of December 31, 2004,  the Fund had no securities on loan. For the year ended
December 31, 2004,  the Fund earned  $3,980 as securities  lending fees,  net of
rebates and agency fees.

NOTE 6. CAPITAL

During the year ended  December  31, 2004 and the year ended  December 31, 2003,
the Fund purchased 652,150 and 570,200 of its shares of common stock on the open
market at a total cost of $4,801,379 and $3,390,652,  respectively. The weighted
average  discount of these purchased shares comparing the purchased price to the
net asset value at the time of purchase was 11.3% and 10.3% respectively.  These
shares are held in  treasury.  In addition,  during the year ended  December 31,
2004 the Fund  reissued  52,561  shares held in treasury as part of the dividend
reinvestment plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Germany Fund, Inc.

   In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  statement  of  assets  and  liabilities,
including the schedule of investments,  and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Germany Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
at December 31, 2004, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial  statements") are the  responsibility of the Fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  of these  financial  statements  in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2004 by
correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provide a reasonable  basis for
our opinion.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Fund offers  shareholders a Voluntary Cash Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  A more complete  description of the Plan is provided in
the Plan brochure available from Investors Bank & Trust Company,  the plan agent
(the "Plan Agent"),  Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 9130, Boston,  Massachusetts
02117 (telephone  1-800-437-6269).  A shareholder  should read the Plan brochure
carefully before enrolling in the Plan.

   Under the Plan, participating  shareholders ("Plan Participants") appoint the
Plan Agent to receive or invest  Fund  distributions  as  described  below under
"Reinvestment of Fund Shares." In addition,  Plan Participants may make optional
cash  purchases  through  the Plan  Agent as often as once a month as  described
below under "Voluntary Cash Purchases."  There is no charge to Plan Participants
for participating in the Plan, although when shares are purchased under the Plan
by the Plan  Agent on the New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  otherwise  on the open
market, each Plan Participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred  in  connection   with  such   purchases,   as  described  below  under
"Reinvestment  of Fund Shares" and "Voluntary Cash  Purchases."

REINVESTMENT  OF FUND  SHARES.  Whenever  the  Fund  declares  a  capital  gains
distribution, an income dividend or a return of capital distribution payable, at
the election of shareholders,  either in cash or in Fund shares, or payable only
in cash, the Plan Agent shall automatically elect to receive Fund shares for the
account of each Plan Participant.

   Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains  distribution,  an income dividend
or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value
per share of the Fund's common stock equals or is less than the market price per
share on the valuation  date (the "Market  Parity or  Premium"),  the Plan Agent
shall  apply the  amount of such  dividend  or  distribution  payable  to a Plan
Participant   to  the  purchase  from  the  Fund  of  Fund  Shares  for  a  Plan
Participant's  account,  except that if the Fund does not offer  shares for such
purpose because it concludes  Securities Act registration  would be required and
such registration cannot be timely effected or is not otherwise a cost-effective
alternative  for the  Fund,  then the Plan  Agent  shall  follow  the  procedure
described in the next paragraph.  The number of additional shares to be credited
to a Plan  Participant's  account  shall be  determined  by dividing  the dollar
amount of the distribution  payable to a Plan Participant by the net asset value
per share of the Fund's common stock on the valuation  date, or if the net asset
value  per share is less than 95% of the  market  price per share on such  date,
then by 95% of the  market  price  per  share.  The  valuation  date will be the
payable date for such dividend or distribution.

   Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains  distribution,  an income dividend
or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value
per share of the Fund's  common stock  exceeds the market price per share on the
valuation date (the "Market Discount"), the Plan Agent shall apply the amount of
such  dividend  or  distribution  payable  to a Plan  Participant  (less  a Plan
Participant's pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred with respect to
open-market  purchases in connection  with the  reinvestment of such dividend or
distribution)  to the  purchase  on the open  market of Fund  shares  for a Plan
Participant's  account.  The  valuation  date will be the payable  date for such
dividend or  distribution.  Such  purchases will be made on or shortly after the
valuation  date and in no event more than 30 days after such date  except  where
temporary  curtailment  or  suspension  of purchase is  necessary to comply with
applicable provisions of federal securities laws.

   The  Plan  Agent  may  aggregate  a Plan  Participant's  purchases  with  the
purchases of other Plan Participants, and the average price (including brokerage
commissions)  of all shares  purchased  by the Plan Agent shall be the price per
share allocable to each Plan Participant.

   For all purposes of the Plan,  the market price of the Fund's common stock on
a payable  date shall be the last sales price on the New York Stock  Exchange on
that date,  or, if there is no sale on such  Exchange  (or,  if  different,  the
principal  exchange  for Fund  shares) on that date,  then the mean  between the
closing bid and asked  quotations  for such stock on such Exchange on such date.
The net asset value per share of the Fund's  common  stock on a  valuation  date
shall be as determined by or on behalf of the Fund.

<PAGE>
VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Plan Agent may hold a Plan Participant's  shares acquired pursuant to the
Plan,  together with the shares of other Plan Participants  acquired pursuant to
this Plan, in  non-certificated  form in the name of the Plan Agent or that of a
nominee.  The Plan  Agent  will  forward  to each  Plan  Participant  any  proxy
solicitation  material  and will vote any shares so held for a Plan  Participant
only in accordance  with the proxy  returned by a Plan  Participant to the Fund.
Upon a Plan Participant's written request, the Plan Agent will deliver to a Plan
Participant,  without charge,  a certificate or certificates for the full shares
held by the Plan Agent.

VOLUNTARY  CASH  PURCHASES.   Plan   Participants  have  the  option  of  making
investments in Fund shares through the Plan Agent as often as once a month. Plan
Participants  may  invest as  little  as $100 in any month and may  invest up to
$36,000 annually through the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan.

   The Plan Agent  shall apply such funds  (less a Plan  Participant's  pro rata
share of brokerage  commissions  or other costs,  if any) to the purchase on the
New York Stock  Exchange (or, if different,  on the principal  exchange for Fund
shares)  or  otherwise  on  the  open  market  of  Fund  shares  for  such  Plan
Participant's account, regardless of whether there is a Market Parity or Premium
or a Market Discount.  The Plan Agent will purchase shares for Plan Participants
on or about the 15th of each  month.  Cash  payments  received by the Plan Agent
less than five business days prior to a cash  purchase  investment  date will be
held by the Plan Agent until the next month's investment date.  Uninvested funds
will not bear  interest.  Plan  Participants  may  withdraw any  voluntary  cash
payment  by  written  notice  received  by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours
before such payment is to be invested.

ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL. Both current shareholders and first-time investors in
the Fund are eligible to participate in the Plan. Current  shareholders may join
the Plan by either  enrolling  their  shares with the Plan Agent or by making an
initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Plan Agent.  First-time investors
in the Fund may join the Plan by making an initial cash deposit of at least $250
with the Plan Agent. In order to become a Plan  Participant,  shareholders  must
complete and sign the enrollment form

included in the Plan brochure and return it, and, if applicable, an initial cash
deposit of at least $250 directly to the Plan Agent if shares are  registered in
their name.  Shareholders  who hold Fund shares in the name of a brokerage firm,
bank  or  other  nominee  should  contact  such  nominee  to  arrange  for it to
participate in the Plan on such shareholder's behalf.

   If the Plan  Participant  elects  to  participate  in the  Plan by  enrolling
current shares owned by the Plan Participant with the Plan Agent,  participation
in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan begins with the next dividend
or capital gains  distribution  payable  after the Plan Agent  receives the Plan
Participant's written authorization,  provided such authorization is received by
the Plan Agent prior to the record date for such  dividend or  distribution.  If
such  authorization  is received after such record date, the Plan  Participant's
participation in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan begins with the
following dividend or distribution.

   If the Plan  Participant  elects  to  participate  in the Plan by  making  an
initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Plan Agent,  participation in the
dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan  begins  with the next  dividend  or
capital  gains  distribution  payable  after the Plan  Agent  receives  the Plan
Participant's  authorization  and  deposit,  and after the Plan Agent  purchases
shares  for the  Plan  Participant  on the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  (or,  if
different,  on the principal  exchange for Fund shares) or otherwise on the open
market,  provided  that the  authorization  and  deposit are  received,  and the
purchases  are  made  by the  Plan  Agent  prior  to the  record  date.  If such
authorization  and deposit are received  after the record  date,  or if the Plan
Agent purchases shares for the Plan Participant  after the record date, the Plan
Participant's  participation  in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan
begins with the following dividend or distribution.

   A shareholder's  written  authorization  and cash payment must be received by
the Plan Agent at least five  business days in advance of the next cash purchase
investment  date  (normally  the 15th of  every  month)  in  order  for the Plan
Participant to participate in the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan in
that month.

   Plan Participants may withdraw from the Plan without charge by written notice
to the Plan Agent. Plan Participants

<PAGE>
VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
who choose to withdraw may elect to receive stock certificates  representing all
of the full shares held by the Plan Agent on their  behalf,  or to instruct  the
Plan  Agent to sell  such  full  shares  and  distribute  the  proceeds,  net of
brokerage  commissions,  to such withdrawing Plan Participant.  Withdrawing Plan
Participants  will  receive  a cash  adjustment  for  the  market  value  of any
fractional  shares held on their behalf at the time of  termination.  Withdrawal
will be effective  immediately with respect to distributions  with a record date
not less than 10 days later  than  receipt  of such  written  notice by the Plan
Agent.

AMENDMENT AND  TERMINATION OF PLAN. The Plan may only be amended or supplemented
by the Fund or by the Plan Agent by giving each Plan Participant  written notice
at least 90 days prior to the effective  date of such  amendment or  supplement,
except that such notice period may be shortened when necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with  applicable  law or the rules or policies of the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory body.

   The Plan may be terminated by the Fund or by the Plan Agent by written notice
mailed to each Plan Participant. Such termination will be effective with respect
to all  distributions  with a record  date at least 90 days after the mailing of
such written notice to the Plan Participants.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS OF REINVESTMENT OF FUND SHARES.  Reinvestment of
Fund shares does not relieve Plan  Participants from any income tax which may be
payable on dividends or  distributions.  For U.S.  federal  income tax purposes,
when the Fund issues shares  representing  an income dividend or a capital gains
dividend,  a  Participant  will  include in income the fair market  value of the
shares received as of the payment date,  which will be ordinary  dividend income
or capital gains,  as the case may be. The shares will have a tax basis equal to
such fair market value,  and the holding period for the shares will begin on the
day after the date of  distribution.  If shares are purchased on the open market
by the Plan Agent, a Plan  Participant  will include in income the amount of the
cash payment  made.  The basis of such shares will be the purchase  price of the
shares,  and the holding  period for the shares will begin on the day  following
the date of purchase. State, local and foreign taxes may also be applicable.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period, December 31, 2004, The Germany Fund, Inc. has
adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR, that applies to
its President and Treasurer and its Chief Financial Officer.

There have been no amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of the code of
ethics during the period covered by this report that would require disclosure
under Item 2.

A copy of the code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has determined that the Fund has at least
one "audit committee financial expert" serving on its audit committee: Mr.
Robert H. Wadsworth. This audit committee member is "independent," meaning that
he is not an "interested person" of the Fund (as that term is defined in Section
2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) and he does not accept any
consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Fund (except in the
capacity as a Board or committee member).

An "audit committee financial expert" is not an "expert" for any purpose,
including for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result
of being designated as an "audit committee financial expert." Further, the
designation of a person as an "audit committee financial expert" does not mean
that the person has any greater duties, obligations, or liability than those
imposed on the person without the "audit committee financial expert"
designation. Similarly, the designation of a person as an "audit committee
financial expert" does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any
other member of the audit committee or board of directors.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established

as amended. The registrant's audit committee consists of Richard Burt, John
Cannon, Robert Wadsworth, and Werner Walbroel (Chairman).

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

Not Applicable

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

The Fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to its investment advisor,
subject to the Board's general oversight. The Fund has delegated proxy voting to
the advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted consistent with the
Fund's best economic interests. The advisor has adopted its own Proxy Voting
Policies and Procedures ("Policies"), and Proxy Voting Guidelines ("Guidelines")
for this purpose. The Policies address, among other things, conflicts of
interest that may arise between the interests of the Fund, and the interests of
the advisor and its affiliates, including the Fund's principal underwriter. The
Guidelines set forth the advisor's general position on various proposals, such
as:

         o  Shareholder Rights -- The advisor generally votes against proposals
            that restrict shareholder rights.

         o  Corporate Governance -- The advisor generally votes for confidential
            and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements
            for charter and bylaw amendments.

         o  Anti-Takeover Matters -- The advisor generally votes for proposals
            that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that
            request boards to redeem poison pills, and votes "against" the
            adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder
            ratification. The advisor generally votes for fair price proposals.

         o  Routine Matters -- The advisor generally votes for the ratification
            of auditors, procedural matters related to the annual meeting, and
            changes in company name, and against bundled proposals and
            adjournment.

The general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies. The
advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance
with the recommendations of an independent third-party, except for proxies
solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an
affiliate serves as investment advisor or principal underwriter ("affiliated
investment companies"). The advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies
in the same proportion as the vote of the investment company's other
shareholders (sometimes called "mirror" or "echo" voting). Master fund proxies
solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Although the Guidelines set forth the advisor's general voting positions on
various proposals, the advisor may, consistent with the Fund's best interests,
determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions.

The Guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of
individual members of the board, or of a majority of the board. In addition, the
Guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices
of the public companies within the Deutsche Bank organization or of the
investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment
advisor or sponsor.

The advisor may consider the views of a portfolio company's management in
deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the
Guidelines, but management's views are not determinative.

As mentioned above, the Policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves
conflicts of interest. To resolve conflicts, the advisor, under normal
circumstances, votes proxies in accordance with its Guidelines. If the advisor
departs from the Guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the
Guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal, a proxy voting
committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy. Before voting any such
proxy, however, the advisor's conflicts review committee will conduct an
investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in
connection with the particular proxy proposal. If the conflicts review committee
determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest, or certain
individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating
in a particular proxy vote, it will inform the proxy voting committee. If
notified that the advisor has a material conflict, or fewer than three voting
members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote, typically the advisor
will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy
voting recommendations of an independent third party. Under certain
circumstances, the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may
find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits
associated with voting. For example, the advisor may not vote proxies on certain
foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs. The advisor generally
does not vote proxies on securities subject to share blocking restrictions.

I.       Overview

This Principal  Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Code of Ethics
("Officer Code") sets forth the policies,  practices,  and values expected to be
exhibited  in the conduct of the  Principal  Executive  Officers  and  Principal
Financial  Officers of the investment  companies  ("Funds") they serve ("Covered
Officers"). A list of Covered Officers and Funds is included on Appendix A.

The Boards of the Funds  listed on  Appendix A have  elected  to  implement  the
Officer Code,  pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
SEC's rules thereunder, to promote and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct in
their Covered Officers.

Deutsche  Asset  Management,  Inc.  or its  affiliates  ("DeAM")  serves  as the
investment adviser to each Fund. All Covered Officers are also employees of DeAM
or an  affiliate.  Thus,  in addition to  adhering  to the Officer  Code,  these
individuals must comply with DeAM policies and procedures, such as the DeAM Code
of Ethics  governing  personal trading  activities,  as adopted pursuant to Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.^1 In addition,  such individuals
also must comply with other applicable Fund policies and procedures.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer,  who shall not be a Covered Officer and who shall
serve  as such  subject  to the  approval  of the  Fund's  Board  (or  committee
thereof), is primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing this Code. The
Compliance  Officer has the  authority  to  interpret  this Officer Code and its
applicability to particular circumstances.  Any questions about the Officer Code
should be directed to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

The DeAM Compliance  Officer and his or her contact  information can be found in
Appendix A.

II.      Purposes of the Officer Code

The purposes of the Officer Code are to deter wrongdoing and to:

o        promote honest and ethical  conduct among Covered  Officers,  including
         the  ethical  handling  of actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest
         between personal and professional relationships;

o        promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable  disclosures in
         reports  and  documents  that the Funds  file with or submit to the SEC
         (and in other public communications from the Funds) and that are within
         the Covered Officer's responsibilities;

o        promote compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;

o        encourage  the prompt  internal  reporting of violations of the Officer
         Code to the DeAM Compliance Officer; and

o        establish accountability for adherence to the Officer Code.

Any  questions  about the Officer  Code should be referred to DeAM's  Compliance
Officer.

- --------

^1 The  obligations  imposed  by the  Officer  Code are  separate  from,  and in
addition to, any obligations  imposed under codes of ethics adopted  pursuant to
Rule  17j-1  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  and any other code of
conduct  applicable to Covered  Officers in whatever  capacity  they serve.  The
Officer  Code does not  incorporate  any of those other codes and,  accordingly,
violations of those codes will not  necessarily be considered  violations of the
Officer Code and waivers granted under those codes would not necessarily require
a waiver to be granted under this Code.  Sanctions imposed under those codes may
be considered  in  determining  appropriate  sanctions for any violation of this
Code.

III.     Responsibilities of Covered Officers

A.       Honest and Ethical Conduct

         It is the duty of every Covered  Officer to encourage  and  demonstrate
         honest and ethical conduct,  as well as adhere to and require adherence
         to the Officer Code and any other  applicable  policies and  procedures
         designed to promote this behavior.  Covered  Officers must at all times
         conduct  themselves with integrity and  distinction,  putting first the
         interests of the Fund(s) they serve.  Covered  Officers  must be honest
         and candid  while  maintaining  confidentiality  of  information  where
         required by law, DeAM policy or Fund policy.

         Covered   Officers  also  must,  at  all  times,  act  in  good  faith,
         responsibly  and with  due  care,  competence  and  diligence,  without
         misrepresenting  or being  misleading  about material facts or allowing
         their  independent  judgment to be subordinated.  Covered Officers also
         should maintain skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of
         their duties for the Fund(s).  Covered  Officers also must  responsibly
         use and control all Fund assets and resources entrusted to them.

         Covered  Officers may not  retaliate  against  others for, or otherwise
         discourage  the  reporting  of,  actual or apparent  violations  of the
         Officer Code or applicable laws or regulations. Covered Officers should
         create an  environment  that  encourages  the exchange of  information,
         including concerns of the type that this Code is designed to address.

B.       Conflicts of Interest

         A  "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's  personal
         interests  interfere with the interests of the Fund for which he or she
         serves as an officer.  Covered  Officers may not  improperly  use their
         position with a Fund for personal or private gain to themselves,  their
         family,  or any other person.  Similarly,  Covered Officers may not use
         their  personal  influence  or  personal   relationships  to  influence
         decisions  or other Fund  business or  operational  matters  where they
         would  benefit  personally  at the  Fund's  expense  or to  the  Fund's
         detriment.  Covered Officers may not cause the Fund to take action,  or
         refrain from taking action,  for their  personal  benefit at the Fund's
         expense or to the Fund's  detriment.  Some  examples  of  conflicts  of
         interest  follow  (this  is not an  all-inclusive  list):  being in the
         position of  supervising,  reviewing or having any influence on the job
         evaluation,  pay or benefit of any  immediate  family  member who is an
         employee of a Fund service provider or is otherwise associated with the
         Fund; or having an ownership  interest in, or having any  consulting or
         employment relationship with, any Fund service provider other than DeAM
         or its affiliates.

         Certain  conflicts  of  interest  covered by this Code arise out of the
         relationships  between  Covered  Officers and the Fund that already are
         subject to conflict of interest  provisions in the  Investment  Company
         Act and the Investment Advisers Act. For example,  Covered Officers may
         not individually  engage in certain  transactions (such as the purchase
         or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of their
         status as  "affiliated  persons"  of the Fund.  Covered  Officers  must
         comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Therefore, any violations
         of  existing  statutory  and  regulatory   prohibitions  on  individual
         behavior could be considered a violation of this Code.

         As  to  conflicts  arising  from,  or  as  a  result  of  the  advisory
         relationship (or any other relationships) between the Fund and DeAM, of
         which the  Covered  Officers  are also  officers  or  employees,  it is
         recognized by the Board that, subject to DeAM's fiduciary duties to the
         Fund,  the Covered  Officers  will in the normal course of their duties
         (whether formally for the Fund or for DeAM, or for both) be involved in
         establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  which  will  have
         different  effects on


                                       4
<PAGE>

         DeAM and the Fund. The Board  recognizes that the  participation of the
         Covered  Officers  in  such  activities  is  inherent  in the  contract
         relationship  between  the Fund and DeAM,  and is  consistent  with the
         expectation of the Board of the performance by the Covered  Officers of
         their duties as officers of the Fund.

         Covered  Officers  should  avoid  actual  conflicts  of  interest,  and
         appearances  of conflicts of  interest,  between the Covered  Officer's
         duties  to the  Fund and his or her  personal  interests  beyond  those
         contemplated  or anticipated  by applicable  regulatory  schemes.  If a
         Covered  Officer  suspects or knows of a conflict or an  appearance  of
         one, the Covered Officer must immediately report the matter to the DeAM
         Compliance  Officer.  If a Covered Officer, in lieu of reporting such a
         matter to the DeAM Compliance  Officer,  may report the matter directly
         to the Fund's Board (or committee  thereof),  as appropriate  (e.g., if
         the  conflict  involves  the DeAM  Compliance  Officer  or the  Covered
         Officer reasonably  believes it would be futile to report the matter to
         the DeAM Compliance Officer).

         When  actual,  apparent or  suspected  conflicts  of interest  arise in
         connection with a Covered  Officer,  DeAM personnel aware of the matter
         should promptly contact the DeAM Compliance  Officer.  There will be no
         reprisal or retaliation against the person reporting the matter.

         Upon receipt of a report of a possible  conflict,  the DeAM  Compliance
         Officer will take steps to determine  whether a conflict exists.  In so
         doing,  the DeAM  Compliance  Officer  may take any  actions  he or she
         determines to be appropriate in his or her sole  discretion and may use
         all  reasonable  resources,   including  retaining  or  engaging  legal
         counsel,  accounting firms or other consultants,  subject to applicable
         law.^2 The costs associated with such actions may be borne by the Fund,
         if appropriate,  after consultation with the Fund's Board (or committee
         thereof).  Otherwise,  such  costs  will be  borne  by  DeAM  or  other
         appropriate Fund service provider.

         After full review of a report of a possible  conflict of interest,  the
         DeAM  Compliance  Officer may determine  that no conflict or reasonable
         appearance  of a conflict  exists.  If,  however,  the DeAM  Compliance
         Officer  determines  that an actual  conflict  exists,  the  Compliance
         Officer will resolve the conflict  solely in the interests of the Fund,
         and will report the conflict and its resolution to the Fund's Board (or
         committee thereof).  If the DeAM Compliance Officer determines that the
         appearance of a conflict exists,  the DeAM Compliance Officer will take
         appropriate  steps to remedy such  appearance.  In lieu of  determining
         whether  a  conflict  exists  and/or  resolving  a  conflict,  the DeAM
         Compliance Officer instead may refer the matter to the Fund's Board (or
         committee  thereof),  as  appropriate.  However,  the  DeAM  Compliance
         Officer  must  refer the  matter  to the  Fund's  Board  (or  committee
         thereof) if the DeAM  Compliance  Officer is  directly  involved in the
         conflict or under similar appropriate circumstances.

         After  responding to a report of a possible  conflict of interest,  the
         DeAM  Compliance  Officer  will  discuss  the  matter  with the  person
         reporting it (and with the Covered  Officer at issue, if different) for
         purposes  of  educating   those  involved  on  conflicts  of  interests
         (including how to detect and avoid them, if appropriate).

         Appropriate   resolution   of  conflicts   may  restrict  the  personal
         activities of the Covered  Officer and/or his family,  friends or other
         persons.

         Solely because a conflict is disclosed to the DeAM  Compliance  Officer
         (and/or the Board or  Committee  thereof)  and/or  resolved by the DeAM
         Compliance  Officer does not mean that the  conflict or its  resolution
         constitutes a waiver from the Code's requirements.

- -----------------

^2 For  example,  retaining  a Fund's  independent  accounting  firm may require
pre-approval by the Fund's audit  committee.

                                       5
<PAGE>

         Any  questions  about  conflicts  of  interests,  including  whether  a
         particular  situation  might be a  conflict  or an  appearance  of one,
         should be directed to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

         C.       Use of Personal Fund Shareholder Information

         A Covered Officer may not use or disclose  personal  information  about
         Fund  shareholders,  except in the performance of his or her duties for
         the Fund. Each Covered Officer also must abide by the Funds' and DeAM's
         privacy policies under SEC Regulation S-P.

         D.       Public Communications

         In connection with his or her  responsibilities for or involvement with
         a  Fund's  public   communications  and  disclosure   documents  (e.g.,
         shareholder reports,  registration  statements,  press releases),  each
         Covered  Officer must  provide  information  to Fund service  providers
         (within the DeAM  organization  or  otherwise)  and to the Fund's Board
         (and  any  committees  thereof),   independent   auditors,   government
         regulators and  self-regulatory  organizations that is fair,  accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable.

         Further,  within the scope of their  duties,  Covered  Officers  having
         direct or supervisory authority over Fund disclosure documents or other
         public Fund communications will, to the extent appropriate within their
         area of responsibility, endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate
         and  understandable  disclosure  in  Fund  disclosure  documents.  Such
         Covered Officers will oversee, or appoint others to oversee,  processes
         for the timely and accurate  creation and review of all public  reports
         and regulatory filings. Within the scope of his or her responsibilities
         as a Covered  Officer,  each  Covered  Officer  also  will  familiarize
         himself or herself with the disclosure  requirements  applicable to the
         Fund,  as well as the business and  financial  operations  of the Fund.
         Each Covered  Officer  also will adhere to, and will promote  adherence
         to, applicable disclosure controls, processes and procedures, including
         DeAM's Disclosure Controls and Procedures,  which govern the process by
         which Fund disclosure documents are created and reviewed.

         To the extent that Covered  Officers  participate  in the creation of a
         Fund's  books or records,  they must do so in a way that  promotes  the
         accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records.

E.       Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations

         In connection with his or her duties and within the scope of his or her
         responsibilities as a Covered Officer, each Covered Officer must comply
         with governmental  laws, rules and regulations,  accounting  standards,
         and  Fund   policies/procedures   that   apply  to  his  or  her  role,
         responsibilities  and duties  with  respect  to the Funds  ("Applicable
         Laws").  These  requirements  do not  impose on  Covered  Officers  any
         additional  substantive duties.  Additionally,  Covered Officers should
         promote compliance with Applicable Laws.

         If a Covered  Officer  knows of any material  violations  of Applicable
         Laws or suspects that such a violation may have  occurred,  the Covered
         Officer  is  expected  to  promptly  report  the  matter  to  the  DeAM
         Compliance Officer.



                                       6

IV.      Violation Reporting

A.       Overview

Each Covered Officer must promptly report to the DeAM Compliance Officer, and
promote the reporting of, any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code.
Failure to report a violation may be a violation of the Officer Code.

Examples of violations of the Officer Code include, but are not limited to, the
following:

o        Unethical or dishonest behavior

o        Obvious lack of adherence to policies surrounding review and approval
         of public communications and regulatory filings

o        Failure to report violations of the Officer Code

o        Known or obvious deviations from Applicable Laws

o        Failure to acknowledge and certify adherence to the Officer Code

The DeAM Compliance Officer has the authority to take any and all action he or
she considers appropriate in his or her sole discretion to investigate known or
suspected Code violations, including consulting with the Fund's Board, the
independent Board members, a Board committee, the Fund's legal counsel and/or
counsel to the independent Board members. The Compliance Officer also has the
authority to use all reasonable resources to investigate violations, including
retaining or engaging legal counsel, accounting firms or other consultants,
subject to applicable law.^3 The costs associated with such actions may be borne
by the Fund, if appropriate, after consultation with the Fund's Board (or
committee thereof). Otherwise, such costs will be borne by DeAM.

B.       How to Report

Any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code must be promptly reported
to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

C.       Process for Violation Reporting to the Fund Board

The DeAM Compliance Officer will promptly report any violations of the Code to
the Fund's Board (or committee thereof).

D.       Sanctions for Code Violations

Violations of the Code will be taken seriously. In response to reported or
otherwise known violations, DeAM and the relevant Fund's Board may impose
sanctions within the scope of their respective authority over the Covered
Officer at issue. Sanctions imposed by DeAM could include termination of
employment. Sanctions imposed by a Fund's Board could include termination of
association with the Fund.

V.       Waivers from the Officer Code

A Covered  Officer may request a waiver from the Officer Code by  transmitting a
written request for a waiver to the DeAM Compliance  Officer.^4 The request must
include the  rationale  for the request and must explain how the waiver would be
in furtherance of the standards of conduct described in and underlying  purposes
of the Officer Code. The DeAM Compliance Officer will present this information

- --------------

^3 For  example,  retaining  a Fund's  independent  accounting  firm may require
pre-approval by the Fund's audit committee.

^4 Of course,  it is not a waiver of the  Officer  Code if the Fund's  Board (or
committee thereof)  determines that a matter is not a deviation from the Officer
Code's requirements or is otherwise not covered by the Code.

                                       7
<PAGE>

to the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof).  The Board (or  committee)  will
determine  whether to grant the requested  waiver.  If the Board (or  committee)
grants the requested waiver, the DeAM Compliance Officer thereafter will monitor
the activities  subject to the waiver, as appropriate,  and will promptly report
to the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof)  regarding  such  activities,  as
appropriate.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public
disclosures of any waivers granted or any implicit waivers.

VI.      Amendments to the Code

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will review the Officer Code from time to time for
its  continued  appropriateness  and will propose any  amendments  to the Fund's
Board (or  committee  thereof) on a timely  basis.  In  addition,  the Board (or
committee  thereof)  will  review the  Officer  Code at least  annually  for its
continued appropriateness and may amend the Code as necessary or appropriate.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public
disclosures of Code amendments.

VII.     Acknowledgement and Certification of Adherence to the Officer Code

Each Covered Officer must sign a statement upon appointment as a Covered Officer
and annually  thereafter  acknowledging that he or she has received and read the
Officer Code, as amended or updated,  and confirming that he or she has complied
with it (see Appendix B:  Acknowledgement and Certification of Obligations Under
the Officer Code).

Understanding and complying with the Officer Code and truthfully  completing the
Acknowledgement and Certification Form is each Covered Officer's obligation.

The DeAM Compliance  Officer will maintain such  Acknowledgements  in the Fund's
books and records.

VIII.    Scope of Responsibilities

A Covered Officer's responsibilities under the Officer Code are limited to:

         (1)      Fund matters over which the Officer has direct  responsibility
                  or   control,   matters   in  which  the   Officer   routinely
                  participates,  and matters with which the Officer is otherwise
                  involved  (i.e.,  matters  within  the  scope  of the  Covered
                  Officer's responsibilities as a Fund officer); and

         (2)      Fund matters of which the Officer has actual knowledge.

IX.      Recordkeeping

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer  will  create  and  maintain  appropriate  records
regarding  the  implementation  and  operation  of the Officer  Code,  including
records relating to conflicts of interest  determinations  and investigations of
possible Code violations.



                                       8

X.       Confidentiality
