  CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present the Annual Report of The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007. The Fund's net asset value
(NAV) was US$23.73 on August 31, 2007, which increased by 36.5%* in U.S. dollar
terms for the fiscal year. The Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (TAIEX), during the
same period, increased by 35.4%* in U.S. dollar terms in comparison. The Fund
outperformed the TAIEX by 0.8% during the fiscal year.

Beginning from this year, the world stock markets have been shaken by two
incidents, namely, the sharp fall of Chinese shares at the end of February and
the reverse of global markets resulting from sub-prime issues. The Fund
outperformed the TAIEX by 1.92% in the first quarter and, 0.64% in August of
this year.

At its April 2007 Board meeting, the Board regretfully accepted the resignation
of two Board members-my predecessor S. Y. Wang as well as Blair Pickerell. We
would like to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Wang and Mr. Pickerell for
their contributions to the Fund over past years. On the other hand, the Board
has been joined by two new directors- Mr. Bing Shen and Mr. Michael Holland. We
sincerely welcome them and look forward to sharing their wisdom.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank you for your continued investment
and support of the Fund. We believe that Taiwan will remain one of the favorable
places to invest in the Greater China Region.

Sincerely,

/s/ Harvey Chang
Harvey Chang
Chairman

  REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

The Fund's net asset value (NAV) increased by 36.5%(*) in U.S. dollar terms for
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007. During the same period, the Taiwan Stock
Exchange Index (TAIEX) increased by 35.4%* in U.S. dollar terms. The Fund
outperformed the TAIEX by 0.8% during the year.

The out-performance was due to stock selection. Stock selection in personal
computer ("PC") & peripheral, retail, and shipping sectors all contributed to
performance during the year.

In the technology sector, the Fund's exposure to the networking company D-Link
and IC design company MediaTek positively contributed to performance due to
strong earnings growth. PC & peripheral companies such as Hon Hai Precision
Industry and Synnex also added to performance. That the Fund was underweight in
the financial sector generated a positive performance contribution relative to
the benchmark. On the negative side, our overweight position in handset related
companies and underweight position in petrochemicals detracted from relative
performance during the year.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

In the second quarter of 2007, Taiwan's gross domestic product ("GDP") grew by
5.07% year over year, representing the strongest growth since 2005. Thanks to
strong fixed capital formation and modest growth in private consumption, real
domestic demand showed a 4.72% rebound. In the external sectors, export and
import of goods and services increased by 4.62% and 3.98%, respectively. Looking
ahead to the second half of 2007, domestic demand is expected to continue to
improve. The external sector should remain robust thanks to the export of
consumer electronic products and Thin Film Transistor-related products. For the
year 2007 as a whole, real GDP is forecasted to grow by 4.58%.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the latest world economic forecast, the world economy in 2008
should continue to show moderate growth. Given Taiwan's strong correlation with
the global economy, Taiwan's exports are expected to continue to grow. Taiwan's
real GDP is forecasted to grow by 4.51% in 2008, due to a combination of robust
exports as well as improved contribution from domestic sectors.

The upcoming presidential election plus resilient demand from China should
continue to give strong support to the Taiwan economy well into the first
quarter of 2008, with the biggest risk to growth coming mainly from possible
weakening of external demand. Because Taiwan is still exposed to the US economy,
exports to US will decline if the sub-prime crisis in the US negatively impacts
US consumption and business investment. There is increasing speculation on
possible improvement in cross-strait relationship after the presidential
election in March 2008. Therefore, we believe downside may be limited because of
a possible return of capital back into the Taiwan market.

MARKET REVIEW

The Taiwan equity market was very bullish during the fiscal year ended August
31, 2007. The TAIEX increased by 35.85% in local NT$. The index consolidated
between the 6,500 and 7,500 levels for several months. With the increasing
participation of retail investors in the second quarter of 2007, the TAIEX
finally broke the 9,000 level to reach 9,807 in mid-July, a seven year high.
Concerns about possible ramifications of the US sub-prime crisis led to a
pullback. The subsequent sharp correction resulted in the TAIEX trading between
9,807 and 7,987. Late panic selling took the TAIEX briefly below 8,000 in mid-
August, followed by a quick rebound to close at 8,982 in the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2007.

In terms of sector performance, rubber (up 112.8%), cement (up 101.2%) and
textile (up 84.6%) were the best performing sectors. While the worst-performing
sectors were tourism (down 4.6%), automobile (up 8.9%) and banking (up 13.2%).
Technology sectors in aggregate were up 31.4%.

INVESTMENT OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY

After a strong rally in the past twelve months, we believe the market will
remain volatile in the near term due to issues such as US

                                                                              5

  REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)

sub-prime related problems. The market remains liquidity driven with domestic
investors playing an important role.

Over the mid term, we remain positive on Taiwan, due to: (1) strong corporate
earnings (from the China market and tech cycle upturn); (2) liquid conditions;
and (3) more market-friendly government policies in the run up to the
presidential election in March next year.

As to corporate earnings results and guidance, any disappointment could cause
selling since the market has already rebounded strongly and retail investors may
prefer to lock in gains if the outlook does not match expectations. Analysis of
second-quarter earning results showed that corporate earnings were mostly
positive. Consensus numbers are being revised upward, but we have not seen any
significant upgrade to 2008 earnings forecasts. Most technology companies
delivered decent results but do not have overly exciting outlooks for the second
half of 2007. The tech sector pull back was due mostly to concerns about the
impact of US sub-prime crisis and its negative impact on US consumer demand. The
United States still constitutes approximately 20-25% of global tech demand but
the rise of emerging markets in recent years has reduced the dominance of the US
market and we anticipate a lower impact on Asian economies from a possible US
downturn.

China and emerging markets play a more important role than ever before. As the
Chinese economy continues its strong growth, Taiwanese companies that have
significant Chinese operations will continue to benefit from their China
exposure. China-concept plays are therefore an important theme in the market.
While most investors associate sectors such as materials and petrochemicals as
beneficiaries of higher growth trends in emerging markets, we believe that
technology stocks also may be winners. From consumer electronic to software used
for emerging market infrastructure projects, we believe that technology-related
stocks will benefit from rapid growth in emerging markets. It appears that
exports of computers and electronics may be on the upswing of a new cycle that
is likely to last for some time. We think that strong emerging market demand
could potentially prove a buffer against any US economic slowdown.

Coordinated moves by central banks worldwide have lowered the risks of a global
economic slowdown and uncertainty. This recovery was driven by central banks'
efforts to inject funds into the financial system as well as the expectation of
interest rate reductions by the US Federal Reserve. As the likely direction of
US monetary policy

has shifted from tightening to neutral, we expect the Taiwanese central bank to
follow the Federal Reserve. Therefore we believe domestic rates in Taiwan will
rise only gradually for the reminder of this year.

Based on statistics released by the Financial Supervisory Commission, Taiwanese
financial institutions have relatively low exposure to sub-prime mortgage-linked
products. The total estimated exposure among Taiwanese financial institutions is
estimated to be NT$75bn, with potential loss estimated at around NT$2.7bn. The
most pessimistic estimate is for a larger loss of up to NT$7.5bn or around 10%
of investments. Nevertheless the total amount of loss is small and the potential
negative impact remains well under control.

We remain positive on the Taiwan market in general. The Taiwan government's
announcement of a cut in the corporate tax rate to 15% indicates the
government's strong determination to boost the stock market. The recent
corrections have provided good opportunities to accumulate quality stocks in the
expectation of a presidential election cycle rally.

In the year ahead, we will continue to work hard to achieve solid performance
through bottom-up stock selection. We believe that the Taiwan stock market and
healthy economic conditions will provide good investment opportunities for
investors in the foreseeable future. Thank you for your support, and we look
forward to presenting our strategy again in the coming reports.

Sincerely,

Shirley Yang

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a Delaware corporation, is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end management investment company.

The Fund is not permitted to invest directly in the securities of Republic of
China ("ROC") companies. Therefore, it invests through a contractual securities
investment trust fund arrangement. This arrangement was established by means of
the Securities Investment Trust, Investment Management and Custodian Contract
("Management Contract") among HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited ("Adviser"), the
Mega International Commercial Bank Co., Ltd., previously known as, International
Commercial Bank of China (Custodian) and the Fund. Under the Management Contract
the Adviser manages and invests the assets of the Fund and the Custodian holds
the assets. The Fund is the sole beneficiary of the assets held under the
Management Contract and, as required by ROC regulations, its interest in the
assets is evidenced by units of beneficial interest.

The Fund concentrates its investments in the securities listed on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange. Because of this concentration, the Fund may be subject to
additional risks resulting from future political or economic conditions in
Taiwan and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws of currency
exchange restrictions affecting Taiwan.

The policies described below are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

Security Valuation.  All securities, including those traded over-the-counter,
for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sales
price prior to the time of determination of the Fund's net asset value per share
or, if there were no sales on such date, at the closing price quoted for such
securities (but if bid and asked quotations are available, at the mean between
the last current bid and asked prices, rather than such quoted closing price).
In certain instances where the price determined above may not represent fair
market value, the value is determined in such manner as the Board of Directors
may prescribe. Foreign securities may be valued at fair value according to
procedures approved by the Board of Directors if the closing price is not
reflective of current market values due to trading or events occurring in the
valuation time of the Fund. In addition, substantial changes in values in the
U.S. markets subsequent to the close of a foreign market may also affect the
values of securities traded in the foreign market. The value of foreign
securities may be adjusted if such movements in the U.S. market exceed a
specified threshold. Short-term investments, having a maturity of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, with accrued
interest or discount earned included in interest receivable.

Repurchase Agreements.  In connection with transactions in repurchase
agreements, it is the Fund's policy that its custodian take possession of the
underlying collateral securities, the fair value of which exceeds the principal
amount of the repurchase transaction, including accrued interest, at all times.
If the seller defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

Foreign Currency Translation.  The financial accounting records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities, other assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
current exchange rate. Purchases and sales of securities, income receipts and
expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the
dates of the transactions.

Reported net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses from disposition of foreign currencies, currency
gains and losses realized between the trade dates and settlement dates of
security transactions, and the difference between the amount of net investment
income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received. The effects of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in securities are not
segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of changes in market
prices of those securities, but are included in realized and unrealized gain or
loss on investments in securities.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued


Forward Foreign Currency Transactions.  A forward foreign currency contract
("Forward") is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell currency at a set
price on a future date. The Fund may enter into Forwards in order to hedge
foreign currency risk or for other risk management purposes. Realized gains or
losses on Forwards include net gains or losses on contracts that have matured or
which the Fund has terminated by entering into an offsetting closing
transaction. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation of Forwards is included in
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and is carried on a net basis. The
portfolio could be exposed to risk of loss if the counterparty is unable to meet
the terms of the contract or if the value of the currency changes unfavorably.
As of August 31, 2007 the Fund had no open Forwards.

Indemnification Obligations.  Under the Fund's organizational documents, its
Officers and Trustees are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of
the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course
of business the Fund enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications
to other parties. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred.

Taxes.  As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code, the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent
that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains for its fiscal year. In addition to federal income tax
for which the Fund is liable on undistributed amounts, the Fund is subject to
federal excise tax on undistributed investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains. The Schedule of Investments includes information
regarding income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information." The Fund is
organized in Delaware and as such is required to pay Delaware an annual
franchise tax. Also, the Fund is currently subject to a Taiwan security
transaction tax of 0.3% on equities and 0.1% on mutual fund shares of the
transaction amount.

The Fund's functional currency for tax reporting purposes is the New Taiwan
dollar.

Investment Income.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except
where the ex-dividend date may have passed; certain dividends from foreign
securities are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date.

Taiwanese companies typically declare dividends in the Fund's third fiscal
quarter of each year. As a result, the Fund receives substantially less dividend
income in the first half of its year. Interest income, which includes accretion
of original discount, is accrued as earned.

Dividend and interest income generated in Taiwan is subject to a 20% withholding
tax. Stock dividends received (except those which have resulted from
capitalization of capital surplus) are taxable at 20% of the par value of the
stock dividends received.

Distributions to Shareholders.  The distributable income from the assets held
under the Management Contract, which is limited to cash dividends and interest
income received, may be distributed to the Fund only once in each year at the
Fund's discretion and is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized capital
gains and stock dividends may also be distributed to the Fund. Within the above
limitations the Fund will, under current ROC regulations, be able to remit out
of the ROC the proceeds of income and capital gains distributions, unit
redemptions and other distributions of assets held under the Management
Contract.

The Fund distributes to shareholders at least annually, substantially all of its
taxable ordinary income and expects to distribute its taxable net realized
gains. Certain foreign currency gains (losses) are taxable as ordinary income
and, therefore, increase (decrease) taxable ordinary income available for
distribution. Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the
"Plan"), shareholders may elect to have all distributions automatically
reinvested in Fund shares. (See the summary of the Plan.) Shareholders who do
not participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash paid by check
in U.S. dollars. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from


                                                                              17

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued


U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. No capital gain distributions
shall be made until any capital loss carryforwards have been fully utilized or
expired.

These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency
transactions, losses deferred due to wash sales and net operating losses.
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder distributions
will result in reclassifications to paid in capital. For the period ended August
31, 2007, the Fund decreased undistributed net investment income by $310,367,
decreased paid-in capital by $1,816,793, and increased accumulated net realized
gain by $2,127,160. These reclassifications have no effect on the net assets or
net asset value per share.

Security Transactions.  Security transactions are accounted as of the trade
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.

Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, purchases and sales of securities,
other than short-term securities, aggregated $249,822,367 and $265,318,178,
respectively.

3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Management Fee.  As the Fund's investment adviser, HSBC Investments (Taiwan)
Limited receives a basic fee that is computed daily at an annual rate of 1.30%
of the Fund's average net assets. The basic fee is subject to monthly
performance adjustment based on the Fund's investment performance as compared to
the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index over a rolling 36-month period (the "performance
adjustments"). The basic fee may increase or decrease by + or -0.30% depending
on the fund's performance.

During the period ending August 31, 2006, the basic fee included a one-time
charge of approximately $154,000 as a further revision to correct errors in the
calculation of performance fee adjustments for the fiscal years prior to 2000
(See footnote 6).

Effective February 1, 2007, the Adviser has agreed to waive a portion of the
basic fee so that the basic fee will not exceed 1.10% of the Fund's average
daily net assets through October 31, 2008. The performance adjustments remain
unchanged by this fee waiver.

For the year ended August 31, 2007, the management fee, including the
performance adjustments, and management fee waiver was equivalent to an annual
rate of 1.14% of average net assets.

Directors Fees.  No director, officer or employee of the Adviser or its
affiliates will receive any compensation from the Fund for serving as an officer
or director of the Fund. The Fund pays each of its directors who is not a
director, officer or employee of the Adviser an annual fee of $15,000 plus
$2,000 for each Board of Directors' meeting or Other Committee meeting attended,
and $2,000 for each meeting attended by telephone. On July 17, 2007 the Board of
Directors approved an increase in the annual fee from $15,000 to $20,000 and an
increase in the meeting fees from $2,000 to $2,500, including phone meetings
effective that day. In addition, the Fund will reimburse each of the directors
for travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Board of
Directors' meetings.

Administration Fees.  State Street Corporation ("State Street") provides, or
arranges for the provision of certain administrative and accounting services for
the Fund, including maintaining the books and records of the Fund, and preparing
certain reports and other documents required by federal and/or state laws and
regulations. The Fund pays State Street a fee at the annual rate of 0.11% of the
Fund's average daily net assets up to $150 million, 0.08% of the next $150
million, and 0.05% of those assets in excess of $300 million, subject to certain
minimum requirements. The fund also pays State Street $130,000 per year for
certain legal administrative services, including corporate secretarial services
and preparing regulatory filings.

4. FUND SHARES

At August 31, 2007, there were 20,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value capital
stock authorized, of which 16,365,572 were issued and outstanding.

5. DISTRIBUTIONS

The Fund did not make any distributions from ordinary income or capital gains
during the year ended August 31, 2007. The fund made a distribution of $856,410
from ordinary income during the year ended August 31, 2006. As of August 31,
2007, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis were $2,329,181 of
Undistributed Ordinary Income, $20,454,064 of Undistributed Long-Term Capital
Gain and $115,559,727 of Unrealized Appreciation.

The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation and
depreciation is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash
sales.

6. PRIOR PERIODS RESTATEMENT

On August 31, 2004, the Fund restated its statement of changes in net assets for
the year ended August 31, 2003 and its financial highlights for the years ended
August 31, 2000 through 2003 to reflect correction of errors in the calculation
of management fee performance adjustments recorded by the Fund during these
years and prior. The incorrect performance adjustments were calculated based on
average net assets of the Fund over a period different than the period over
which average net assets of the Fund should have been calculated as stipulated
in the Management Contract and resulted in overpayments being made to the
investment adviser. The cumulative effect at September 1, 1999, and the yearly
net effect, of these corrections on net assets, net asset value per share and
the ratio of expenses were as follows:

7. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48 - Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which
requires the tax effects of certain tax positions to be recognized. These tax
positions must meet a "more likely than not" standard that based on their
technical merits, have a more than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
examination. FASB Interpretation No. 48 is effective for fiscal periods
beginning after December 15, 2006. At adoption, the financial statements must be
adjusted to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be
sustained. Management of the fund is currently evaluating the impact that FASB
Interpretation No. 48 will have on the fund's financial statements.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 157, Fair Value Measurements, which
clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their
disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in
interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. Adoption of SFAS
157 requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time, management is in the
process of reviewing the Standard against its current valuation policies to
determine future applicability.

8. CHANGE IN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT

On April 23, 2007, the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors"), upon the
recommendation of the Audit Committee, appointed Tait, Weller & Baker LLP as the
Fund's independent registered public accountant.



                                                                              19

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE TAIWAN FUND, INC.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The
Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments, as of
August 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations, the statement of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights for the year then ended.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. The statement
of changes in net assets for the year ended August 31, 2006 and the financial
highlights for each of the four years in the period ended August 31, 2006 have
been audited by other auditors, whose report dated October 19, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on such statement and financial highlights.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities
owned as of August 31, 2007, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or
by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not
received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Taiwan Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2007, the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights for the year then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

  SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND
  CASH PURCHASE PLAN

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN?

The Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") offers
shareholders of the Fund, a prompt and simple way to reinvest their dividends
and capital gains distributions in shares of the Fund. The Fund will distribute
to shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its net income and
expects to distribute annually its net realized capital gains. Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. (formerly, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.) (the "Plan
Administrator"), a federally chartered trust institution, acts as Plan
Administrator for shareholders in administering the Plan. The Plan also allows
you to make optional cash investments in Fund shares through the Plan
Administrator.

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN?

If you own shares in your own name, you can elect to participate directly in the
Plan. If you own shares that are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or
other nominee, you should contact your nominee to arrange for them to
participate on your behalf.

WHAT DOES THE PLAN OFFER?

The Plan has two components; reinvestment of dividends and capital gains
distributions, and a voluntary cash purchase feature.

REINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS DISTRIBUTIONS

If you choose to participate in the Plan, your dividends and capital gains
distributions will be promptly invested for you, automatically increasing your
holdings in the Fund. If the Fund declares a dividend or capital gains
distribution payable in cash, you will automatically receive shares purchased by
the Plan Administrator on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open
market.

If a distribution is declared which is payable in shares or cash at the option
of the shareholder and if on the valuation date (generally the payable date) the
market price of shares is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, the Fund
will issue new shares to you at the greater of the following: (a) net asset
value per share or (b) 95% of the market price per share. If the market price
per share on the valuation date is less than the net asset value per share, the
Fund will issue new shares to you at the market price per share on the valuation
date.

All reinvestments are in full and fractional shares, carried to three decimal
places. In the case of foreign (non-U.S.) shareholders, reinvestment will be
made net of applicable withholding tax.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE OPTION

Plan participants have the option of making investments in Fund shares through
the Plan Administrator. You may invest any amount from $100 to $3,000 semi-
annually. The Plan Administrator will purchase shares for you on the New York
Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market on or about February 15 and
August 15. If you hold shares in your own name, you should deal directly with
the Plan Administrator. Checks should be made payable to "Computershare". The
Plan Administrator will not accept cash, traveler's checks, money orders, or
third party checks for voluntary cash purchase. We suggest you send your check
to the following address to be received at least two business days before the
investment date: Computershare, c/o The Taiwan Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010,
Providence, RI 02940-3010. The Plan Administrator will return any cash payments
received more than thirty


                                                                              23

<PAGE>

  SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND
  CASH PURCHASE PLAN (continued)

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------


days prior to February 15 or August 15, and you will not receive interest on
uninvested cash payments. If you own shares that are held in the name of a
brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your nominee to
arrange for them to participate in the cash purchase option on your behalf.

IS THERE A COST TO PARTICIPATE?

Each participant will pay a pro rata portion of brokerage commissions payable
with respect to purchases of shares by the Plan Administrator on the New York
Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market. Otherwise, there is no charge to
participants for reinvesting dividends and capital gains distributions, since
the Plan Administrator's fees are paid by the Fund. Brokerage charges for
purchasing shares through the Plan are expected to be less than the usual
brokerage charges for individual transactions, because the Plan Administrator
will purchase stock for all participants in blocks, resulting in lower
commissions for each individual participant.

For purchases from voluntary cash payments, participants are charged a service
fee of $.75 for each investment and a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.

Brokerage commissions and service fees, if any, will be deducted from amounts to
be invested.

WHAT ARE THE TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS?

You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to help
you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

If the Fund issues shares upon reinvestment of a dividend or capital gains
distribution, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount reportable in
respect of the reinvested amount of the dividend or distribution will be the
fair market value of the shares received as of the payment date, which will be
reportable as ordinary dividend income and/or long term capital gains. The
shares will have a tax basis equal to such fair market value, and the holding
period for the shares will begin on the day after the payment date. State, local
and foreign taxes may also be applicable.

ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PLAN, MAY I WITHDRAW FROM IT?

You may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by calling the Plan
Administrator at 1-800-426-5523, by accessing your Plan account at the Plan
Administrator's web site, www.computershare.com/equiserve or by written notice
to the Plan Administrator.

If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in
your name for all full shares, or, if you wish, the Plan Administrator will sell
your shares and send you the proceeds, less a service fee of $2.50 and less
brokerage commissions. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares
you hold at the time of your withdrawal to cash at the current market price and
send you a check for the proceeds.

All sale requests having an anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are
expected to be submitted in the written form. In addition, all sale requests
within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be submitted in
written form.

amendment. In the case of termination, participants will be mailed written

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant has delegated to its investment adviser the voting of proxies
relating to the registrant's portfolio securities. The policies and procedures
used by the investment adviser to determine how to vote proxies relating to the
registrant's portfolio securities, including the procedures used when a vote
presents a conflict of interest involving the investment adviser or any of its
affiliates, are contained in the investment adviser's Proxy Voting Guidelines,
which are attached hereto as Exhibit 12(a)(4).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANY.

(a)(1) As of September 30, 2007, the portfolio manager of the registrant is as
follows:

SHIRLEY YANG

Ms. Yang has been the Portfolio Manager of the Taiwan Fund, Inc. since June 30,
2007. Ms. Yang is an Assistant Vice President of HSBC Investments (Taiwan)
Limited.

Prior to joining HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited, Ms. Yang worked at INVESCO
Taiwan where she was a Senior Fund Manager (March 2004 to June 2007). Prior to
March 2004, Ms. Yang worked at Prudential Asset Management, Taiwan (June 2003 to
March 2004) as an Investment Manager. Prior to June 2003, Ms. Yang worked at
E-Sun Financial Holding Company (June 2002 to March 2003) as an Investment
Manager.

(a)(2)

As of September 30, 2007, Ms. Yang managed the Taiwan Fund, Inc. with a total of
approximately $412.2 million in assets.

As of September 30, 2007, Ms. Yang does not manage any mutual funds nor pooled
investment vehicles.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: While the portfolio manager does not currently manage any
other fund or account, actual or potential conflicts of interest may arise when
a portfolio manager has management responsibilities with respect to more than
one fund. For example, a portfolio manager may identify a limited investment
opportunity that may be appropriate for the Fund as well as for the other

                                       5
<PAGE>
 funds or accounts he or she manages. A conflict of interest also might arise
where a portfolio manager has a larger personal investment in one fund than in
another. A portfolio manager may purchase a particular security for one or more
funds while selling the security for one or more other funds; this could have a
detrimental effect on the price or volume of the securities purchased or sold by
a fund. A portfolio manager might devote unequal time and attention to the funds
he or she manages. The adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies
and procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and
other conflicts of interest. As a result, the adviser does not believe that any
of these potential sources of conflicts of interest will affect the portfolio
manager's professional judgment in managing the Fund. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION:

The adviser has structured a compensation program based on factors designed to
attract and retain key personnel as well as to provide incentives for top
quality performance. The program is designed to recognise the long-term nature
of the firm's business, and to encourage retention and continuity of service of
the people who contribute to the organization's success.

The adviser, through a performance review system rewards both team and
individual contribution. Each individual has a job profile and a set of Key
Performance Measures ("KPMs") to ensure that the year's objectives are clear and
attainable. KPMs do not just reflect tangible outputs of an individual's role;
they also incorporate the behaviours and team efforts displayed by each member
of staff. Thus, the firm's portfolio managers are not assessed solely on the
performance of the funds that they manage.

Investment professionals typically receive a base salary and an incentive bonus.
The total sum set aside for bonus payments each year is a function of HSBC
Investment's profitability as a whole. In determining the amount to allocate to
each individual, three factors are assessed:

      -     The performance of the local company;

      -     The performance of the investment team; and

      -     The performance of the individual.

During the annual appraisal process, each department manager reviews his/her
team's performance and contribution to the adviser for the past year on an
individual basis. Bonuses and raises are awarded based on the individual's
contribution to the team. Promotions are awarded to individuals who have
performed well beyond what was expected for their level.

OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES: The following table sets forth, for each portfolio
manager, the aggregate dollar range of the registrant's equity securities
beneficially owned as of September 30, 2007.

                                                      [ADOPTED OCTOBER 20, 2003]

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.    This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
      applies to the Fund's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
      President and Treasurer (or persons performing similar functions)
      ("Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

      -     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships.

      -     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Fund;

      -     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

      -     prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      -     accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest. The Fund will expect all Covered Officers to
comply at all times with the principles in this Code. A violation of this Code
by an employee is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including discharge
and possible legal prosecution. Any question about the application of the Code
should be referred to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors (the
"Audit Committee").

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST

      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act")
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. The compliance
programs and procedures of the Fund and HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Ltd., the
Fund's investment

                                       1
<PAGE>

adviser (the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions. Certain conflicts of interest also arise out of
the personal securities trading activities of the Covered Officers and the
possibility that they may use information regarding the Fund's securities
trading activities for their personal benefit. The Fund's Code of Ethics under
Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act is designed to address these
conflicts of interest. This Code does not, and is not intended to, replace these
programs and procedures or the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code of Ethics, and this Code's
provisions should be viewed as being additional and supplemental to such
programs, procedures and code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will,
in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the Fund. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is consistent with
the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by other codes.

      Each Covered Officer must not:

      -     use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
            influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
            whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
            detriment of the Fund;

      -     cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
            individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
            benefit of the Fund; and

      -     use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
            contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
            trade personally or cause others to trade personally in
            contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

      Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
material business affiliations outside the Fund and must update the report
annually.

      Covered Officers should avoid situations which involve the appearance of,
or potential for, conflicts of interest. Examples of these situations include:

      -     accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
            and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
            with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings,
            not including occasional meals or tickets to theatre or sporting
            events or other similar entertainment, provided it is


                                       2
<PAGE>

            business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
            place and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety.

      -     any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than
            its investment adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

      -     a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
            compensation or equity ownership.

      In situations involving a Covered Officer which involve the appearance of,
or the potential for, conflicts of interest, but where the Covered Officer
believes that no significant conflict of interest exist, the Covered Officer
must obtain prior written approval from the Audit Committee before becoming
involved in that situation. No such approval shall be considered a waiver of
this Code.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

      -     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
            and compliance requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

      -     each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
            others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
            within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's directors and
            auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
            organizations;

      -     each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
            area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
            the Fund and the Adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
            accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
            documents the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other
            public communications made by the Fund; and

      -     it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
            laws, rules and regulations.

IV.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

      Each Covered Officer must:

      -     upon adoption of the Code or (thereafter as applicable, upon
            becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he
            has received, read and understands the Code;

      -     annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with
            the requirements of the Code;


                                       3

      -     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of
            the Fund or their affiliated persons for reports of potential
            violations that are made in good faith; and

      -     notify the Audit Committee promptly if he knows of any violation of
            this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

      The Audit Committee is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any waivers sought by a Covered
Officer must be considered by the Audit Committee.

each employee of the Adviser annually together with a memorandum requesting that
any violations of the Code be communicated immediately to the Audit Committee.

      The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

      -     the Audit Committee will take all appropriate action to investigate
            any potential violations reported to it;

      -     if, after such investigation, the Audit Committee believes that no
            violation has occurred, the Audit Committee is not required to take
            any further action;

      -     if the Audit Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
            will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
            appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
            notification to appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board;
            or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

      -     the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers of this
            Code, as appropriate; and

      -     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
            be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    CHANGES TO OR WAIVERS OF THE CODE

      No change to or waiver of any provision of this Code will be effective
until the Fund discloses the nature of any amendment to, or waiver from, a
provision of the Code in its Form N-CSR, or on its website within five business
days following the date of the amendment or waiver if this method of disclosure
has been established in its Form N-CSR and made available on its website for
twelve months. Any waiver of provisions of this Code will be reported in filings
with the SEC and otherwise reported to the Fund's stockholders to the full
extent required by the rules of the SEC and by any applicable rules of any
securities exchange on which the Fund's securities are listed.

                     HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (TAIWAN) LIMITED

                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

                              As of August 1, 2003


<PAGE>




                    HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (TAIWAN) LIMITED

                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

      HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Limited (the "Advisor") is an investment
advisor registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that serves
as the investment manager for the Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") pursuant to a
Securities Investment Trust-Investment Management and Custodian Contract dated
August 22, 2001 (the "Management Contract") among the Fund, the Advisor and the
International Commercial Bank of China, the Fund's Taiwan custodian.

      Under the Taiwan Regulations Governing Securities Investment Trust Fund
Enterprises (the "SITE Regulations") and the Taiwan Rules Governing the Use of
Proxies for Attendance at Shareholder Meetings of Public Companies (the "Proxy
Rules"), the Advisor has the responsibility for exercising voting rights
("Voting Rights") on the shares of Taiwan companies held under the Management
Contract, and the Fund has delegated to the Advisor the duty to exercise Voting
Rights with respect to such shares. Under the SITE Regulations and the Proxy
Rules, the Advisor must exercise the Voting Rights on behalf of the Fund in a
manner which is in the best interests of the Fund; provided that the Advisor is
required to vote in favor of proposals made or candidates for director or
supervisor nominated by the Board of Directors of the company issuing the shares
which are being voted (the "Issuing Company") unless the Advisor determines that
there is unsound management of the Issuing Company which may cause damage to the
interests of the Issuing Company or its shareholders ("Unsound Management"). If
the Advisor determines that there is Unsound Management with respect to an the
Issuing Company, the SITE Regulations and the Proxy Rules require that the
shares at issue be voted in accordance with a resolution of the Board of
Directors of the Advisor.


                                       2
<PAGE>


      Under the U.S. Investment Advisors Act of 1940, the Advisor is a fiduciary
that owes the Fund a duty of care and loyalty with respect to all services it
undertakes on the Fund's behalf, including exercising Voting Rights. The Advisor
is therefore subject to a fiduciary duty, within the confines of applicable
Taiwan law, to exercise Voting Rights in a manner the Advisor believes is
consistent with the Fund's best interests. In fulfilling its obligations to the
Fund, the Advisor will seek to act in a manner that it believes is most likely
to enhance the economic value of the underlying securities held for the Fund
under the Management Contract.

Proxy Voting Committee

      In light of these fiduciary duties, and given the complexity of the issues
that may arise in connection with the exercise of Voting Rights, the Advisor has
formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee") to address issues on behalf of
the Advisor relating to the exercise of Voting Rights.

Scope of Committee Responsibilities

      The Committee shall have responsibility for determining how to exercise
Voting Rights. In doing so, the Committee will seek to ensure that Voting Rights
are exercised in the best interests of the Fund, and that Voting Rights are
exercised in a manner free from unwarranted influences.

      The Committee shall also establish the Advisor policies with respect to
Voting Rights, with such advice, participation and research as the Committee
deems appropriate from Portfolio Managers or other knowledgeable interested
parties. The Committee shall be responsible for determining how the Voting
Rights policies will be applied to specific votes, in light of each Issuing
Company's unique structure, management, strategic options and probable economic
consequences of alternative actions.


                                       3
<PAGE>


      In view of the requirements of Taiwan law with respect to the exercise of
Voting Rights, the Committee's primary focus will be on determining whether or
not voting in favor of proposals made by an Issuing Company's Board of Directors
or management are consistent with the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder. In circumstances where the Committee determines that voting in
favor of such a proposal (or a proposal supported by the Issuing Company's Board
of Directors) is consistent with the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder, the Committee will cause the Advisor to exercise the Voting Rights
in favor of the proposal following applicable Taiwan legal and voting
procedures. In circumstances where the Committee determines that voting shares
in favor of a proposal is clearly not in the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder, the Committee will present the matter to the Board of Directors of
the Advisor in a timely manner with a recommendation that the Board of Directors
adopt a resolution authorizing the Advisor to vote against the proposal based on
the fact that the proposal reflects Unsound Management. The Advisor believes
that any circumstance where the Board of Directors or management of an Issuing
Company makes or supports a proposal submitted to a shareholder vote which is
clearly not in the best interests of shareholders reflects Unsound Management.

      The Committee will adopt policies with respect to recurring shareholder
voting matters, such as the election of directors and supervisors, which it
generally will follow with respect to these recurring matters and which are
attached to these voting guidelines. The Committee may, however, determine that
the subject matter of a proposal is not suitable for general voting guidelines
and requires a case-by-case determination. The Advisor believes that certain
Voting Rights issues require investment analysis -- such as approval of mergers
and other significant corporate transactions -- akin to investment decisions,
and are therefore not suitable for general guidelines.

      Pursuant to Article 44 of the SITE Regulations, prior to voting at a
shareholder meeting of an Issuing Company in which the Fund holds shares, the
Committee will prepare a written

                                       4
<PAGE>

report describing the assessment and analysis process used in determining how to
exercise the Voting Rights. In addition, if Voting Rights are exercised pursuant
to a resolution of the Advisor's Board of Directors, a written report of the
exercise of Voting Rights will be submitted to the Board after the shareholder
meeting.

      The Committee shall obtain copies of shareholder meeting notifications and
attendance cards and shall retain a written record of the exercise of Voting
Rights by the Advisor and the results of the voting. This record shall be kept
in consecutive order in files which shall be maintained for at least five years
after the shareholder meeting.

Committee Membership

      The Committee will be chaired by the Chief Investment Officer of the
Advisor responsible for the investment of the Fund's securities. The Committee
shall also include the deputy portfolio manager for the Fund, the Advisor's
senior compliance officer and such other personnel with investment and/or
relevant experience as the Chief Investment Officer deems appropriate. No
employee of the Advisor whose responsibilities relate primarily to marketing or
sales, and no person with any investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or
research responsibilities for the Advisor's affiliates may serve as a member of
the Committee or participate in its decision-making.

Circumstances Involving Conflicts of Interest

      In circumstances where the exercise of Voting Rights involves an actual or
apparent conflict of interest involving the Advisor or any of the Advisor's
affiliates, the decision regarding the exercise of Voting Rights will be made
exclusively by members of the Committee who have no personal involvement with or
relationship to the matter which produces the conflict of interest. For example,
if an Issuing Company is an investment advisory client of the Advisor, no
individual associated with the Advisor who has any relationship or involvement
with providing

                                       5
<PAGE>

advisory services to the Issuing Company shall participate in the decision with
respect to the exercise of those Voting Rights.




                                       6
<PAGE>
                                 VOTING POLICIES

      The Committee will analyze each exercise of Voting Rights individually.
The Committee has adopted the following voting guidelines, which represent the
Committee's usual voting position on certain recurring Voting Rights issues that
do not involve unusual circumstances. With respect to any Voting Rights issue,
however, the Committee may vote differently than a voting guideline if the
Committee determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Fund.

      (a)   Board of Directors

      The Committee's general policy is to vote for nominees for director in
uncontested elections, except for nominees which have demonstrably poor records
of representing shareholder interests.

      (b)   Auditors

      The Committee's general policy is to vote for approval of independent
auditors, except for

      -  Auditors that have a financial interest in, or material association
         with, the Issuing Company they are auditing, and are therefore believed
         not to be independent.

      -  Auditors who have rendered an opinion to any company which is either
         not consistent with best accounting practices or indicative of the
         company's financial situation.

      (c)   Compensation and Benefits

      The Committee's general policy is to recommend a vote against proposals
regarding compensation and benefits for senior executive officers and directors
of issuing companies which are clearly in excess of levels of compensation and
benefits provided typically by Taiwan companies in similar circumstances.
