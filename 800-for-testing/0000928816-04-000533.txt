To Our Shareholders,

I am pleased to be writing to you as Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of John Hancock Funds, LLC.

As you may know, John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. -- the parent
company of John Hancock Funds -- was acquired by Manulife Financial
Corporation on April 28, 2004. The merger combines two exceptionally strong
companies into a single, integrated, global market leader whose scale and
capital will create an industry pacesetter strengthening our company's
leadership in markets around the world.

Although this change has no impact on the mutual funds you have invested
in, it did bring with it some changes in the executive-level management of
John Hancock Funds. Specifically, Maureen Ford Goldfarb has decided to step
down as chairman, president and chief executive officer in order to pursue
personal interests. Since her appointment in January 2000, Maureen has
provided John Hancock Funds with strong leadership and steady guidance
through several years of extremely turbulent market and industry
conditions.

Effective May 12, 2004, I have also been appointed by your Board of
Trustees to the roles of Trustee, President and Chief Executive Officer of
your fund. I have been in the investment business for over 25 years, most
recently as President of Retirement Services at John Hancock Financial
Services. In that role, my responsibilities included developing and
directing the sale of John Hancock's variable and fixed annuity businesses
through a diverse distribution network of banks and broker-dealers --
including wirehouses, regional brokerage houses and financial planners.

Prior to joining John Hancock, I served as Co-Chief Executive Officer of
MetLife Investors Group, a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. In that capacity my
responsibilities included the design, manufacture and distribution of
MetLife's annuity and life insurance products sold through third-party
channels.

Although there has been a change in executive-level management, the one
thing that never wavers is John Hancock Funds' commitment to placing the
needs of our shareholders above all else. We are all dedicated to the task
of working with you and your financial advisors to help you reach your
long-term financial goals.

Sincerely,

/S/ JAMES A. SHEPHERDSON,

James A. Shepherdson,
Chief Executive Officer

YOUR FUND
AT A GLANCE

The Fund seeks
to provide high
current income,
consistent with
modest growth
of capital, for
holders of its
common shares
by investing at
least 80% of its
assets in dividend-
paying securities.

Over the last six months

* A dividend tax cut and bond rally helped buoy demand for preferred and
  utility common stocks, but the last month of the period saw a sell-off on
  fears of higher interest rates.

* The Fund benefited from advantageous security selection among preferred
  stocks.

* A significant stake in utility common stocks also aided performance.

MANAGERS'
REPORT

JOHN HANCOCK
Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II

Preferred stocks -- which are the primary emphasis of John Hancock Patriot
Premium Dividend Fund II -- posted positive returns during the six-month
period ended April 30, 2004. An increasing number of companies that issued
preferred stocks in years when interest rates were higher redeemed those
older preferred stocks to take advantage of the lower interest rates that
prevailed during much of the period. While the preferred market was also
helped by a Treasury market rally in early March, a string of
stronger-than-expected monthly economic reports in April resulted in one of
the largest sell-offs in Treasuries in eight years, hurting preferred stock
prices.

Utility common stocks -- the Fund's other area of focus -- also performed
well during the period. Part of investors' renewed optimism was in reaction
to efforts by utilities to reduce debt, improve their financing and shed
money-losing unregulated subsidiaries. Like many preferreds, most utility
common stocks also benefited from increased investor interest in response
to federal dividend tax relief enacted in May 2003. Utilities traditionally
have offered consistently high dividends over the years.

"Preferred stocks...posted
 positive returns during
 the six-month period
 ended April 30, 2004."

PERFORMANCE

For the six months ended April 30, 2004, John Hancock Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II returned 6.58% at net asset value. By comparison, the
average income and preferred stock closed-end fund returned 4.53%,
according to Lipper, Inc. In the same six-month period, the Dow Jones
Utility Average -- which tracks the performance of 15 electric and natural
gas utilities --

returned 10.34%, and the broader stock market, as measured
by the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, returned 6.27%.

paragraph.]

LEADERS AND LAGGARDS

Within the preferred-stock category, some of our best-performing holdings
were those issued by financial services companies. Lehman Brothers, for
example, performed quite well, fueled by strength in bond trading and
underwriting, stock sales and mergers. Merrill Lynch also performed well,
thanks to its strong credit rating compared with its brokerage services
group peers and enhanced earnings consistency resulting from what the
company termed "a diversity of revenues from multiple asset classes, client
segments and geographic regions." Bear Stearns benefited from increased
revenues and cost controls, which resulted in substantial improvement in
the company's profitability.

ENERGY STRONG

Preferred stocks issued by oil and natural gas companies also posted
positive returns during the period. In the post-September 11 era, energy
prices stayed high and, late in the period, began to climb, in part because
of a so-called "risk premium" for potential attacks both here and abroad.
Those high energy prices, in turn, helped boost the fortunes of holdings
such as Anadarko Petroleum, Apache, Devon Energy and Nexen.

"Within the preferred-stock
 category, some of our best-
 performing holdings were
 those issued by financial
 services companies."

High energy prices also helped some of our utility common stocks,
particularly Dominion Resources, which has significant oil and gas
operations. It also enjoyed strong results from its regulated electric
operation. The common stock of electric utility Alliant Energy also
performed well, boosted in large part by investors' enthusiasm over the
company's back-to-basics approach.

A disappointment during the period was Kansas City-based Aquila, a
multinational energy provider that has been trying to regain financial
stability after retreating from the wholesale

<PAGE>


energy-trading markets that caused so many utilities pain in 2002.
Despite these problems, we continued to hold onto our stake in Aquila
because we believe the company is making positive steps toward reducing
its debt, strengthening its balance sheet and putting its energy-trading
problems behind it.

OUTLOOK

April's Treasury market sell-off roiled all fixed-income markets,
including preferred stocks and so-called interest-rate-sensitive common
stocks such as utilities. Although the economy has heated up, we don't
think that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates much
until the current recovery deepens and sustains itself for a bit longer
period of time. Granted, longer-term bond yields have risen as investors
worried about the prospects of future inflation, but the expected lack
of a significant near-term interest-rate hike should keep short-term
interest rates historically low, thereby making preferred stocks an
attractive alternative to shorter-term, lower-yielding money market and
Treasury securities. We believe the panic-driven sell-off in the
fixed-income markets in April should abate as the bargains it has
created slowly become apparent against the backdrop of a gradual- versus
aggressive-moving Federal Reserve. This should eventually help to
support tax-advantaged preferred stock values, as well as high
dividend-yielding commons, such as utilities. Utility common stocks have
other factors working in their favor as well, such as the potential for
more stable credit ratings and dividend payments.

This commentary reflects the views of the portfolio management team through
the end of the Fund's period discussed in this report. The team's
statements reflect their own opinions. As such, they are in no way
guarantees of future events, and are not intended to be used as investment
advice or a recommendation regarding any specific security. They are also
subject to change at any time as market and other conditions warrant.

The Fund normally will invest more than 65% of its managed assets in
securities of companies in the utilities industry. Such an investment
concentration makes the Fund more susceptible than a more broadly
diversified fund to factors adversely affecting the utilities industry.
Sector investing is subject to greater risks than the market as a whole.

STATEMENTS

NOTE A
Accounting policies

John Hancock Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified
closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

Significant accounting policies
of the Fund are as follows:

Valuation of investments

Securities in the Fund's portfolio are valued on the basis of market
quotations, valuations provided by independent pricing services or at
fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
approved by the Trustees. Short-term debt investments maturing within 60
days are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. The
Fund determines the net asset value of the common shares each business
day.

Investment transactions

Investment transactions are recorded as of the date of purchase, sale or
maturity. Net realized gains and losses on sales of investments are
determined on the identified cost basis.

Discount and premium
on securities

The Fund accretes discount and amortizes premium from par value on
securities from either the date of issue or the date of purchase over
the life of the security.

Expenses

The majority of expenses are directly identifiable to an individual
fund. Expenses that are not readily identifiable to a specific fund are
allocated in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into
consideration, among other things, the nature and type of expense and
the relative sizes of the funds.

Federal income taxes

The Fund qualifies as a "regulated investment company" by complying with
the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and will not be
subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.
The Fund paid $90,228 of federal excise tax due to calendar year
distribution requirements. For federal income tax purposes, the Fund has
$555,078 of a capital loss carryforward available, to the extent
provided by regulations, to offset future net realized capital gains. To
the extent that such carryforward is used by the Fund, no capital gain
distributions will be made. The loss carryforward expires as follows:
October 31, 2010 -- $533,811 and October 31, 2011 -- $21,267.

Dividends, interest
and distributions

Dividend income on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend
date or, in the case of some foreign securities, on the date thereafter
when the Fund identifies the dividend. Interest income on investment
securities is recorded on the accrual basis. Foreign income may be
subject to foreign withholding taxes, which are accrued as applicable.


15
<PAGE>


The Fund records distributions to common and preferred shareholders from
net investment income and realized gains on the ex-dividend date.

Such distributions, on a tax basis, are determined in conformity with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Distributions in
excess of tax basis earnings and profits, if any, are reported in the
Fund's financial statements as a return of capital.

Use of estimates

The preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, incorporates estimates made by management in determining the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the
Fund. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

NOTE B
Management fee and
transactions with
affiliates and others

The Fund has an investment management contract with John Hancock
Advisers, LLC (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of John Hancock
Financial Services, Inc. Under the investment management contract, the
Fund pays a monthly management fee to the Adviser at an annual rate of
0.50% of the Fund's average weekly net assets and the value attributable
to the DARTS, plus 5.00% of the Fund's weekly gross income. The
Adviser's total fee is limited to a maximum amount equal to 1.00%
annually of the Fund's average weekly net assets and the value
attributable to the DARTS. For the period ended April 30, 2004 the
advisory fee incurred did not exceed the maximum advisory fee allowed.

The Fund has an administrative agreement with the Adviser under which
the Adviser oversees the custodial, auditing, valuation, accounting,
legal, stock transfer and dividend disbursing services and maintains
Fund communications with the shareholders. The Fund pays the Adviser a
monthly administration fee at an annual rate of 0.10% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets plus the value attributable to the preferred
shares.

Mr. James A. Shepherdson is a director and/or officer of the Adviser
and/or its affiliates, as well as Trustee of the Fund. The compensation
of unaffiliated Trustees is borne by the Fund. The unaffiliated Trustees
may elect to defer, for tax purposes, their receipt of this compensation
under the John Hancock Group of Funds Deferred Compensation Plan. The
Fund makes investments into other John Hancock funds, as applicable, to
cover its liability for the deferred compensation. Investments to cover
the Fund's deferred compensation liability are recorded on the Fund's
books as an other asset. The deferred compensation liability and the
related other asset are always equal and are marked to market on a
periodic basis to reflect any income earned by the investment as well as
any unrealized gains or losses. The Deferred Compensation Plan
investments had no impact on the operations of the Fund.

Dutch Auction Rate
Transferable Securities
preferred shares Series A
and Series B

The Fund issued Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities preferred
shares ("DARTS"), 598 shares of Series A and 598 shares of Series B in a
public offering. The underwriting discount was recorded as a reduction
of the capital of common shares. During the year ended October 31, 1990,
the Fund retired 98 shares of DARTS from both Series A and Series B.

Dividends on the DARTS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate
that was established at the offering of the DARTS and has been reset
every 49 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend rates on DARTS Series A
and B ranged from 1.07% to 1.14% and from 1.00% to 1.17%, respectively,
during the period ended April 30, 2004. Accrued dividends on DARTS are
included in the value of DARTS on the Fund's Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

The DARTS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption
price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends
on any dividend payment date. The DARTS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus
accumulated and unpaid dividends, if the Fund is in default on its asset
coverage requirements with respect to the DARTS, as defined in the
Fund's by-laws. If the dividends on the DARTS shall remain unpaid in an
amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the DARTS, as
a class, have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In
general, the holders of the DARTS and the common shareholders have equal
voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
DARTS, as a class, vote to elect two members of the Board of Trustees,
and separate class votes are required on certain matters that affect the
respective interests of the DARTS and common shareholders.

NOTE D
Investment
transactions

Purchases and proceeds from sales and maturities of securities, other
than short-term securities and obligations of the U.S. government,
during the period ended April 30, 2004, aggregated $29,124,818 and
$18,784,139, respectively.

The cost of investments owned on April 30, 2004, including short-term
investments, for federal income tax


17
<PAGE>


purposes was $271,310,009. Gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation of investments aggregated $21,916,691 and $23,203,898
respectively, resulting in net unrealized depreciation of $1,287,207.
The difference between book basis and tax basis net unrealized
depreciation of investments is attributable primarily to the tax
deferral of losses on certain sales of securities.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICY

The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high current income
consistent with modest growth of capital for holders of its common
shares of beneficial interest. The Fund will pursue its objective by
investing in a diversified portfolio of dividend paying preferred and
common stocks.

The Fund's non-fundamental investment policy, with respect to the
quality of ratings of its portfolio investments, was changed by a vote
of the Fund's Trustees on September 13, 1994. The policy, which became
effective October 15, 1994, stipulates that preferred stocks and debt
obligations in which the Fund will invest will be rated investment-grade
(at least "BBB" by S&P or "Baa" by Moody's) at the time of investment or
will be preferred stocks of issuers of investment grade senior debt,
some of which may have speculative characteristics, or, if not rated,
will be of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser. The Fund
will invest in common stocks of issuers whose senior debt is rated
investment-grade or, in the case of issuers that have no rated senior
debt outstanding, whose senior debt is considered by the Adviser to be
of comparable quality. The policy supersedes the requirement that at
least 80% of the Fund's total assets consist of preferred stocks and
debt obligations rated "A" or higher and dividend-paying common stocks
whose issuers have senior debt rated "A" or higher.

On November 20, 2001, the Fund's Trustees approved the following
investment policy investment restriction change, effective December 15,
2001. Under normal circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80% of
its assets in dividend-paying securities. The "Assets" are defined as
net assets including the liquidation preference amount of the DARTS plus
borrowings for investment purposes. The Fund will notify shareholders at
least 60 days prior to any change in this 80% investment policy.

BY-LAWS

In November 2002, the Board of Trustees adopted several amendments to
the Fund's by-laws, including provisions relating to the calling of a
special meeting and requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals or
nominees for Trustee. The advance notice provisions in the by-laws
require shareholders to notify the Fund in writing of any proposal that
they intend to present at an annual meeting of share- holders, including
any nominations for Trustee, between 90 and 120 days prior to the first
anniversary of the mailing date of the notice from the prior year's
annual meeting of shareholders. The notification must be in the form
prescribed by the by-laws. The advance notice provisions provide the
Fund and its Trustees with the opportunity to thoughtfully consider and
address the matters proposed before the Fund prepares and mails its
proxy statement to shareholders. Other amendments set forth the
procedures that must be followed in order for a shareholder to call a
special meeting of shareholders. Please contact the Secretary of the
Fund additional information about the advance notice requirements or the
other amendments to the by-laws.

Effective December 16, 2003, the Trustees approved additional changes to
the Fund's by-laws. The changes included updating the leveraged rating
agency requirements, in keeping with recent changes to the agencies'
basic maintenance reporting requirements for leveraged closed-end funds.
In addition, changes were made to reflect recent updates that Moody's
made to some of their eligible asset and discount factors. These
revisions bring the Fund's by-laws in line with current rating agency
requirements.

DIVIDEND
REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund offers its shareholders a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the


19
<PAGE>


"Plan"), which offers the opportunity to earn compounded yields. Each
holder of common shares may elect to have all distributions of dividends
and capital gains reinvested by Mellon Investor Services, as plan agent
for the common shareholders (the "Plan Agent"). Holders of common shares
who do not elect to participate in the Plan will receive all
distributions in cash, paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder
of record (or, if the common shares are held in street or other nominee
name, then to the nominee) by the Plan Agent, as dividend disbursing
agent.

Shareholders may join the Plan by filling out and mailing an
authorization card, by notifying the Plan Agent by telephone, or by
visiting the Plan Agent's Web site at www.melloninvestor.com.
Shareholders must indicate an election to reinvest all or a portion of
dividend payments. If received in proper form by the Plan Agent before
the record date of a dividend, the election will be effective with
respect to all dividends paid after such record date. Shareholders whose
shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact the
broker or nominee to determine whether and how they may participate in
the Plan.

If the Fund declares a dividend payable either in common shares or in
cash, non-participants will receive cash and participants in the Plan
will receive the equivalent in common shares. If the market price of the
common shares on the payment date of the dividend is equal to or exceeds
their net asset value as determined on the payment date, participants
will be issued common shares (out of authorized but unissued shares) at
a value equal to the higher of net asset value or 95% of the market
price. If the net asset value exceeds the market price of the common
shares at such time, or if the Board of Trustees declares a dividend
payable only in cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan
participants, buy shares in the open market, on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. Such purchases
will be made promptly after the payable date for such dividend and, in
any event, prior to the next ex-dividend date after such date, except
where necessary to comply with federal securities laws. If, before the
Plan Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net
asset value of the common shares, the average per share purchase price
paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the common
shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend had been paid in shares issued by the Fund.

Each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in
connection with the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. In each
case, the cost per share of the shares purchased for each participant's
account will be the average cost, including brokerage commissions, of
any shares purchased on the open market plus the cost of any shares
issued by the Fund. There will be no brokerage charges with respect to
common shares issued directly by the Fund. There are no other charges to
participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gain distributions.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan at any time by
contacting the Plan Agent by telephone, in writing or by visiting the
Plan Agent's Web site at www.melloninvestor.com. Such withdrawal will be
effective immediately if received not less than ten days prior to a
dividend record date; otherwise, it will be effective for all subsequent
dividend record dates. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or
upon termination of the Plan, as provided below, certificates for whole
common shares credited to his or her account under the Plan will be
issued and a cash payment will be made for any


20
<PAGE>


fraction of a share credited to such account.

The Plan Agent maintains each shareholder's account in the Plan and
furnishes monthly written confirmations of all transactions in the
accounts, including information needed by the shareholders for personal
and tax records. The Plan Agent will hold common shares in the account
of each Plan participant in noncertificated form in the name of the
participant. Proxy material relating to the shareholders' meetings of
the Fund will include those shares purchased as well as shares held
pursuant to the Plan.

The reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any federal income tax that may be payable or required
to be withheld on such dividends or distributions. Participants under
the Plan will receive tax information annually. The amount of dividend
to be reported on 1099-DIV should be (1) in the case of shares issued by
the Fund, the fair market value of such shares on the dividend payment
date and (2) in the case of shares purchased by the Plan Agent in the
open market, the amount of cash used by the Plan Agent to purchase
shares in the open market, including the amount of cash allocated to
brokerage commissions paid on such purchases.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan
as applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all shareholders of the Fund at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent after at least 90 days'
written notice to all shareholders of the Fund. All correspondence or
additional information concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Agent, Mellon Bank, N.A., c/o Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box
3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938 (telephone 1-800-852-0218).

<DESCRIPTION>ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE CHARTER
<TEXT>

JOHN HANCOCK FUNDS
ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE CHARTER

A.  Composition.  The Administration Committee shall be composed of all
Trustees who are both "independent" as defined in the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange and are not "interested persons" as defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940 of John Hancock Adviser LLC or of the Trust (the
"Independent Trustees").

B.  Overview.  The overall charter of the Administration Committee is:  (i) to
review and comment on complex-wide matters to facilitate uniformity among the
funds; (ii) to select and nominate Independent Trustees to be added to the
Board; (iii) to oversee liaison between management and the Independent
Trustees; (iv) to review the performance of the Independent Trustees as
appropriate; (v) to review matters relating to the Independent Trustees, such
as compensation, retirement arrangements, Committee assignments and the like;
(vi) to consider matters of general corporate governance applicable to the
Independent Trustees, and (vii) when appropriate, to oversee the assignment of
tasks to other Committees.

C.  Nomination of Independent Trustees

1.  Selection of Trustee Nominees.  Except where the funds are legally
required to provide third parties with the ability to nominate trustees, the
Administration Committee shall be responsible for (i) identifying individuals
qualified to become Independent Trustees and (ii) recommending to the Board of
Trustees the persons to be nominated for election as Independent Trustees at
any meeting of stockholders and the persons to be elected by the Board to fill
any vacancies on the Board by the death, resignation or removal of an
Independent Trustee.  Persons to serve as Trustees who are not Independent
Trustees shall be nominated by the Board.

2.  Criteria for Selecting Trustees.  The Administration Committee shall use
the criteria and the principles set forth on Annex A, as revised from time to
time, to guide its trustee selection process.  The Administration Committee
shall periodically review the requisite skills and criteria for Independent
Trustees as well as the composition of the Board as a whole.  The Committee
shall adopt, and periodically review and revise as it deems appropriate,
procedures regarding trustee candidates recommended by shareholders.  The
current policy is attached as Annex A.

D.  Other Specific Responsibilities.  The Administration Committee shall have
the following duties and powers, to be exercised at such times and in such
manner as the Committee shall deem necessary or appropriate:

1.  To consider the allocation of activities among the various Committees and
the full Board, to suggest to the Committees the degree of detail in their
reports to the full Board, and to establish membership and rotation policies
for Committees.

2.  To consider the number of funds under supervision by the Independent
Trustees and the ability of the Independent Trustees to discharge successfully
their fiduciary duties and to pursue self-education in mutual fund matters.

3.  To propose the amount of compensation to be paid by the funds to the
Independent Trustees and to address compensation-related matters, such as
expense reimbursement policies.

4.  To evaluate, from time to time, the time, energy, expertise, knowledge,
judgment and personal skills which Independent Trustees brings to the Board
and to consider retirement policies for the Independent Trustees.

5.  To participate in the development of agendas for Board and Committee
meetings.

6.  To consider, evaluate and make recommendations regarding the type and
amount of fidelity bond, and director and officer and/or errors and omission
insurance coverage, for the funds, the Board and the Independent Trustees, as
applicable.

7.  To consider, evaluate and make recommendations and necessary findings
regarding independent legal counsel and any other advisers, experts or
consultants, that may be engaged from time to time, other than as may be
engaged directly by another Committee.

8.  To evaluate feedback from shareholders as appropriate.  Annex A includes
procedures for shareholders to communicate with the members of the
Administration Committee.

E.  Additional Responsibilities.  The Committee will also perform other tasks
assigned to it from time to time by full Board, and will report findings and
recommendations to the full Board, as appropriate.

F.  Governance.  One member of the Committee shall be appointed as chair.  The
chair shall be responsible for leadership of the Committee, including
scheduling meetings or reviewing and approving the schedule for them,
preparing agendas or reviewing and approving them before meetings, presiding
over meetings, and making reports to the full Board, as appropriate.

G.  Miscellaneous.  The Committee shall meet as often as it deems appropriate,
with or without management, as circumstances require.  The Committee shall
have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its
responsibilities, including the authority to retain special counsel and other
advisers, experts or consultants, at the funds' expense, as it determines
necessary to carry out its duties.  The Committee shall have direct access to
such officers of and service providers to the funds as it deems desirable.

H.  Review.  The Committee shall review this Charter periodically and
recommend such changes to the full Board as it deems desirable.


ANNEX A

General Criteria

1.  Nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to
high ethical standards.

2.  Nominees should have demonstrated business acumen, experience and ability
to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and
long-term objectives of the Fund(s) and should be willing and able to
contribute positively to the decision-making process of the Fund(s).

3.  Nominees should have a commitment to understand the Fund(s), and the
responsibilities of a Trustee/Director of an investment company and to
regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees.

4.  Nominees should have the ability to understand the sometimes conflicting
interests of the various constituencies of the Fund, including shareholders
and the management company, and to act in the interests of all shareholders.

5.  Nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that
would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all the
shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director /trustee.

6.  Nominees shall not be discriminated against on the basis of race,
religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other
basis proscribed by law.  The value of diversity on the Board should be
considered.

Application of Criteria to Existing

The renomination of existing Trustees should not be viewed as automatic, but
should be based on continuing qualification under the criteria set forth
above.  In addition, the Administrative Committee shall consider the existing
trustees' performance on the Board and any committee.

Review of Shareholder Nominations

Any shareholder recommendation must be submitted in compliance with all of the
pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
to be considered by the Administration Committee.  In evaluating a nominee
recommended by a shareholder, the Administration Committee, in addition to the
criteria discussed above, may consider the objectives of the shareholder in
submitting that nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the
interests of all shareholders. If the Board determines to include a
shareholder's candidate among the slate of nominees, the candidate's name will
be placed on the Fund's proxy card.  If the Administration Committee or the
Board determines not to include such candidate among the Board's designated
nominees and the shareholder has satisfied the requirements of Rule 14a-8, the
shareholder's candidate will be treated as a nominee of the shareholder who
originally nominated the candidate.  In that case, the candidate will not be
named on the proxy card distributed with the Fund's proxy statement.

As long as an existing Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of the
Administration Committee, to satisfy the criteria listed above, the Committee
generally would favor the re-nomination of an existing Trustee rather than a
new candidate.  Consequently, while the Administration Committee will consider
nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as trustees, the Administration
Committee may only act upon such recommendations if there is a vacancy on the
Board or the Administration Committee determines that the selection of a new
or additional Independent Trustee is in the best interests of the Fund.  In
the event that a vacancy arises or a change in Board membership is determined
to be advisable, the Administration Committee will, in addition to any
shareholder recommendations, consider candidates identified by other means,
including candidates proposed by members of the Administration Committee.
While it has not done so in the past, the Administration Committee may retain
a consultant to assist the Committee in a search for a qualified candidate

Communications from shareholders

Shareholders may communicate with the members of the Board as a group or
individually.  Any such communication should be sent to the Board or an
individual Trustee c/o the secretary of the Fund at the address on the notice
of this meeting.  The Secretary may determine not to forward any letter to the
members of the Board that does not relate to the business of the Fund.
