Dear Fellow Shareholders,

The stock market made little, if any, headway year-to-date through October
2004, as it wrestled with a variety of uncertainties. Questions about the
continuing strength of the economy, the effects of rising interest rates
and expectations for corporate earnings growth kept investors jittery. In
addition, record high crude oil prices, geopolitical issues and a closely
contested U.S. presidential race all weighed on the market. The picture
brightened in early November with the election over and oil prices
moderating somewhat.

Year-to-date through October 31, 2004, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was
up 3.06%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite
Index were slightly negative, returning -2.40% and -1.05%, respectively.
Despite the Federal Reserve's three hikes in short-term interest rates from
historic lows, bonds still managed to outperform stocks, with the Lehman
Brothers Aggregate Bond Index up 4.22%.

In news closer to home, we are pleased to announce that on June 15, 2004,
your fund's Board of Trustees appointed Charles L. Ladner as independent
Chairman of the Board of Trustees, a position previously held by John
Hancock Funds LLC's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maureen
Ford Goldfarb. This appointment came in advance of new SEC regulations
requiring all mutual funds to have independent chairmen.

Mr. Ladner has served as an independent member of John Hancock Funds' Board
of Trustees since 1992 and formerly held the position of Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of UGI Corporation, a public utility
holding company in Valley Forge, PA, until his retirement in 1998. He
brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and leadership and we are
delighted to have him serve as Chairman.

Sincerely,

/S/ JAMES A. SHEPHERDSON

James A. Shepherdson,
Chief Executive Officer

MANAGERS'
REPORT

JOHN HANCOCK
Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II

Preferred stocks -- which are the primary emphasis of John Hancock Patriot
Premium Dividend Fund II -- were on a proverbial roller-coaster ride during
the 12 months ended October 31, 2004, fluctuating in response to changing
expectations about the economy, inflation and interest rates. Preferred stocks
began the period on somewhat of a weak footing when faster-than-expected
economic growth fanned fears of higher interest rates and caused preferreds to
lapse into negative territory. Because preferreds make fixed payments in the
form of dividends, their prices, like bonds', tend to move in the opposite
direction of expectations for potential interest rates moves. Later, a
wintertime preferred stock rally was triggered by weaker-than-expected
employment data and comments from the Fed indicating that interest rate hikes
were still distant. In the spring, the preferred market sold off once more
when a string of stronger-than-expected economic reports and Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan's Congressional testimony convinced investors that the Fed would
raise interest rates sooner than expected. But in the final three months of
the period, preferreds stabilized and later rallied as investors anticipated
the Fed's three rate hikes, followed by reassuring comments from the Fed
suggesting it would take a "measured" approach to subsequent rate hikes.

"Preferred stocks...were on a
 proverbial roller-coaster ride dur
 ing the 12 months ended October
 31, 2004..."

Utility commons outperform

Utility common stocks enjoyed much more favorable conditions and produced
far better returns than preferreds for the year, defying historical trends
by doing well when interest rates were on the rise. Some of their success
owed to the 2003 reduction in federal taxes individuals pay on most stock
dividends. Utilities traditionally have offered consistently high dividends
over the years, and those with dividends subject to tax relief benefited
the most during the period.

Another factor aiding the group was its overall improved financial condition,
the result of utilities' efforts to reduce debt, improve their balance sheets
and shed money-losing unregulated subsidiaries.

Performance

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2004, John Hancock Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II posted total returns of 14.82% at net asset value and 8.06%
at market value. The difference in the Fund's net asset value (NAV)
performance and its market performance stems from the fact that the market
share price is subject to the dynamics of secondary market trading, which
could cause it to trade at a discount or premium to the Fund's NAV share price
at any time. By comparison, the average income and preferred stock closed-end
fund returned 12.76% at net asset value, according to Lipper, Inc. In the same
12-month period, the Dow Jones Utility Average -- which tracks the performance
of 15 electric and natural gas utilities -- returned 28.69%, and the broader
stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, returned 9.42%.

"Among the Fund's best performers
 for the year were some utility
 common stocks..."

Performance boosters

Among the Fund's best performers for the year were some utility common stocks,
including our holdings in Dominion Resources. The company, a fully integrated
gas and electric holding company, generated strong results from its regulated
electric operation and from improving trends in its gas operations due to
rising energy prices. Our holdings in Ameren Corp., an electric and natural
gas utility serving Missouri and Southern Illinois, also benefited
performance. Investors liked the company's acquisition of Illinois Power,
which will add to the company's stable regulated operations, further
supporting an attractive dividend payout. A disappointment among our utility
common holdings was Kansas City-based Aquila, an electric and gas energy
provider that has been punished by investors after retreating from the
wholesale energy-trading markets. Despite the company's challenges in fighting
its way back, we continue to maintain our stake in Aquila because it has taken
a number of positive steps to rebuild its balance sheet. It has extracted
itself from money-losing gas supply contracts and executed a successful common
and preferred stock offering,

the proceeds of which were used to retire high-cost debt, thereby lowering
interest costs.

The first listing is Electric utilities 48%; the second is Gas utilities
10%, the third is Investment banking & brokerage 10%, the fourth is
Multi-utilities & unregulated power 9%, and the fifth is Oil & gas
exploration & production 6%.]

Preferreds

Even in a period when tax policy favored tax-advantaged preferred stocks, a
number of our fully taxable preferred holdings were some of our better
performers due to the combination of a lack of supply and rising demand.
Standouts included our holdings in Baltimore Gas & Electric, which
benefited from the fact that it was a relatively scarce, higher-quality
issue with good call protection, meaning that it couldn't be redeemed by
its issuer for a stated period of time. In addition, we enjoyed good gains
from Coastal Finance, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation, which rallied as
El Paso sold non-core assets, paid down debt and improved its balance
sheet.

[Pie chart in middle of page with heading "Portfolio diversification1" The
chart is divided into three sections (from top to right): Preferred stocks
64%, Common stocks 34%, and Short-term investments 2%.]

Outlook

There's been a kind of disconnect between recent Fed actions and the bond and
preferred markets' reactions over the past several months. Contrary to
historical patterns, bonds and preferreds have recently rallied as rates rose.
In our view, this counter-intuitive reaction suggests that the bond market may
be forecasting that high and rising oil prices, plus the recent interest rate
increases themselves, may be the catalysts for slower economic growth down the
road. Moreover, it appears that there are some other crosscurrents that could
work against the economy, namely a slowdown in consumer consumption as home
loan refinancings slow, and the potential lack of new tax cuts to spur
spending. That

<PAGE>


said, the Fed has indicated that it is leaning toward future rate increases.
If the economy strengthens and there is more upward pressure on interest rates
than the market currently anticipates, preferreds could undergo a period of
lackluster performance. On the other hand, stable or falling rates would
likely bode well for preferreds. As for utility common stocks, we remain
optimistic about their prospects. The utility companies' improving financial
health should continue to catch the eye of investors looking for high
dividend-paying defensive stocks.

[Table at top of page entitled "Scorecard." The header for the left column
is "Investment" and the header for the right column is "Period's
performance...and what's behind the numbers." The first listing is Coastal
Finance followed by an up arrow with the phrase "Parent company's moves
help subsidiary." The second listing is Dominion Resources followed by an
up arrow with the phrase "Rising energy prices help boost financial
performance." The third listing is Aquila followed by a down arrow with the
phrase "Residual problems with energy trading."]

"...stable or falling rates would likely
 bode well for preferreds."

This commentary reflects the views of the portfolio management team through
the end of the Fund's period discussed in this report. The managers'
statements reflect their own opinions. As such, they are in no way
guarantees of future events, and are not intended to be used as investment
advice or a recommendation regarding any specific security. They are also
subject to change at any time as market and other conditions warrant.

The Fund normally will invest more than 65% of its managed assets in
securities of companies in the utilities industry. Such an investment
concentration makes the Fund more susceptible than a more broadly
diversified fund to factors adversely affecting the utilities industry.
Sector investing is subject to greater risks than the market as a whole.

  respectively.

4 Ratios calculated on the basis of net investment income relative to the
  average net assets of common shares. Without the exclusion of preferred
  shares, the ratio of net investment income would have been 5.80%, 5.50%,
  5.46%, 5.14% and 4.66%, respectively.

5 Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities from the Fund's
  total assets and dividing such amount by the number of DARTS outstanding as
  of the applicable 1940 Act Evaluation Date, which may differ from the
  financial reporting date.

of 60 days or less may be valued at amortized cost which approximates
market value. The Fund determines the net asset value of the common shares
each business day.

Investment transactions

Investment transactions are recorded as of the date of purchase, sale or
maturity. Net realized gains and losses on sales of investments are
determined on the identified cost basis.

Discount and premium
on securities

The Fund accretes discount and amortizes premium from par value on
securities from either the date of issue or the date of purchase over the
life of the security.

Expenses

The majority of expenses are directly identifiable to an individual fund.
Expenses that are not readily identifiable to a specific fund are allocated
in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into consideration, among
other things, the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes of the
funds.

Federal income taxes

The Fund qualifies as a "regulated investment company" by complying with
the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and will not be
subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. For
federal income tax purposes, the Fund has $52,139 of a capital loss
carryforward available, to the extent provided by regulations, to offset
future net realized capital gains. To the extent that such carryforward is
used by the Fund, no capital gain distributions will be made. The loss
carryforward expires as follows: October 31, 2010 -- $30,872 and October
31, 2011 -- $21,267.

Dividends, interest
and distributions

Dividend income on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend
date or, in the case of some foreign securities, on the date thereafter
when the Fund identifies the dividend. Interest income on investment
securities is recorded on the accrual basis. Foreign income may be subject


16
<PAGE>


to foreign withholding taxes, which are accrued as applicable.

The Fund records distributions to common and preferred shareholders from
net investment income and net realized gains on the ex-dividend date.
During the year ended October 31, 2003, the tax character of distributions
paid was as follows: ordinary income $16,582,725. During the year ended
October 31, 2004, the tax character of distributions paid was as follows:
ordinary income $13,498,673.

As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis included $3,382,752 of undistributed ordinary income.

Such distributions and distributable earnings, on a tax basis, are
determined in conformity with income tax regulations, which may differ from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits, if any, are
reported in the Fund's financial statements as a return of capital.

Use of estimates

The preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
incorporates estimates made by management in determining the reported
amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Fund. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

Note B
Management fee and
transactions with affiliates and others

The Fund has an investment management contract with John Hancock Advisers,
LLC (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of John Hancock Financial
Services, Inc. Under the investment management contract, the Fund pays a
monthly management fee to the Adviser at an annual rate of 0.50% of the
Fund's average weekly net assets and the value attributable to the Dutch
Auction Rate Transferable Securities preferred shares (collectively,
"managed assets"), plus 5.00% of the Fund's weekly gross income. The
Adviser's total fee is limited to a maximum amount equal to 1.00% annually
of the Fund's average weekly managed assets. For the year ended October 31,
2004 the advisory fee incurred did not exceed the maximum advisory fee
allowed.

The Fund has an administrative agreement with the Adviser under which the
Adviser oversees the custodial, auditing, valuation, accounting, legal,
stock transfer and dividend disbursing services and maintains Fund
communications with the shareholders. The Fund pays the Adviser a monthly
administration fee at an annual rate of 0.10% of the Fund's average weekly
managed assets. The compensation for the year amounted to $271,229. The
Fund also paid the Adviser the amount of $821 for certain publishing
services, included in the printing fees.

Mr. James A. Shepherdson is a director and/or officer of the Adviser and/or
its affiliates, as well as Trustee of the Fund. The compensation of
unaffiliated Trustees is borne by the Fund. The unaffiliated Trustees may
elect to defer, for tax purposes, their receipt of this compensation under
the John Hancock Group of Funds Deferred Compensation Plan. The Fund makes
investments into other John Hancock funds, as applicable, to cover its
liability for the deferred compensation. Investments to cover the Fund's
deferred compensation liability are recorded on the Fund's books as an
other asset. The deferred compensation liability and the related other
asset are always equal and are marked to market on a periodic basis to
reflect any income earned by the investments, as well as any unrealized
gains or losses. The Deferred Compensation Plan investments had no impact
on the operations of the Fund.

Dutch Auction Rate
Transferable Securities
preferred shares Series A
and Series B

The Fund issued Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities preferred shares
("DARTS"), 598 shares of Series A and 598 shares of Series B in a public
offering. The underwriting discount was recorded as a reduction of the
capital of common shares. During the year ended October 31, 1990, the Fund
retired 98 shares of DARTS from both Series A and Series B.

Dividends on the DARTS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate that
was established at the offering of the DARTS and has been reset every 49
days thereafter by an auction. Dividend rates on DARTS Series A and B
ranged from 1.07% to 1.79% and from 1.00% to 1.99%, respectively, during
the year ended October 31, 2004. Accrued dividends on DARTS are included in
the value of DARTS on the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

The DARTS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption price
equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
dividend payment date. The DARTS are also subject to mandatory redemption
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends, if the Fund is in default on its asset coverage
requirements with respect to the DARTS, as defined in the Fund's by-laws.
If the dividends on the DARTS shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two
full years' dividends, the holders of the DARTS, as a class, have the right
to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the holders of
the DARTS and the common shareholders have equal voting rights of one vote
per share, except that the holders of the DARTS, as a class, vote to elect
two members of the Board of Trustees, and separate class votes are required
on certain matters that affect the respective interests of the DARTS and
common shareholders.

Note D
Investment
transactions

Purchases and proceeds from sales or maturities of securities, other than
short-term securities and obligations of the U.S. government, during the
year ended October 31, 2004, aggregated $32,692,427 and $24,977,053,
respectively.

The cost of investments owned on October 31, 2004, including short-term
investments, for federal income tax purposes, was $270,717,949. Gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments aggregated
$26,621,665 and $20,523,575, respectively, resulting in net unrealized
appreciation of $6,098,090. The difference between book basis and tax basis
net unrealized appreciation of investments is attributable primarily to the
tax deferral of losses on certain sales of securities.


18
<PAGE>


Note E
Reclassification
of accounts

During the year ended October 31, 2004, the Fund reclassified amounts to
reflect a decrease in accumulated net realized loss on investments of $304, an
increase in accumulated net investment income of $83,294 and a decrease in
capital paid-in of $83,598. This represents the amounts necessary to report
these balances on a tax basis, excluding certain temporary differences, as of
October 31, 2004. Additional adjustments may be needed in subsequent reporting
periods. These reclassifications, which have no impact on the net asset value
of the Fund, are primarily attributable to certain differences in the
computation of distributable income and capital gains under federal tax rules
versus accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and book and tax differences in accounting for deferred compensation
and nondeductible excise tax. The calculation of net investment income (loss)
per share in the Fund's Financial Highlights excludes these adjustments.

Note F
Subsequent event

A special meeting of shareholders was held on December 1, 2004, at which time
one or more new Trustees were elected to the Fund's Board of Trustees. Several
Trustees had reached the age for mandatory retirement and plan to retire in
2004 and 2005. The Board of Trustees recommended and shareholders approved a
proposal to consolidate the two panels into one Board of Trustees for all
open-end funds within the John Hancock funds complex. The effective date for
the newly elected Trustees to the Fund will be January 1, 2005.

AUDITORS'
REPORT

Report of Deloitte
& Touche, LLP,
Independent
Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
John Hancock Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II,

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments, of John Hancock Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II (the "Fund") as of October 31, 2004, and the related
statement of operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes
in net assets for the years ended October 31, 2004 and 2003 and the
financial highlights for each of the years in the five-year period ended
October 31, 2004. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities owned at October 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Fund as of October 31, 2004, the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets and its financial highlights for the respective

TAX
INFORMATION

Unaudited

For federal income tax purposes, the following information is furnished
with respect to the distributions of the Fund, if any, paid during its
taxable year ended October 31, 2004.

With respect to the ordinary dividends paid by the Fund for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2004, 100.00% of the dividends qualifies for the
corporate dividends-received deduction.

The Fund hereby designates the maximum amount allowable of its net taxable
income as qualified dividend income as provided in the Jobs and Growth Tax
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. This amount will be reflected on Form
1099-DIV for the calendar year 2004.

Shareholders will be mailed a 2004 U.S. Treasury Department Form 1099-DIV
in January 2005. This will reflect the total of all distributions that are
taxable for calendar year 2004.

Investment
objective
and policy

The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high current income
consistent with modest growth of capital for holders of its common shares
of beneficial interest. The Fund will pursue its objective by investing in
a diversified portfolio of dividend paying preferred and common stocks.

The Fund's non-fundamental investment policy, with respect to the quality
of ratings of its portfolio investments, was changed by a vote of the
Fund's Trustees on September 13, 1994. The policy, which became effective
October 15, 1994, stipulates that preferred stocks and debt obligations in
which the Fund will invest will be rated investment-grade (at least "BBB"
by S&P or "Baa" by Moody's) at the time of investment or will be preferred
stocks of issuers of investment-grade senior debt, some of which may have
speculative characteristics, or, if not rated, will be of comparable
quality as determined by the Adviser. The Fund will invest in common stocks
of issuers whose senior debt is rated investment-grade or, in the case of
issuers that have no rated senior debt outstanding, whose senior debt is
considered by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The policy
supersedes the requirement that at least 80% of the Fund's total assets
consist of preferred stocks and debt obligations rated "A" or higher and
dividend-paying common stocks whose issuers have senior debt rated "A" or
higher.

On November 20, 2001, the Fund's Trustees approved the following investment
policy investment restriction change, effective December 15, 2001. Under
normal circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in
dividend-paying securities. The "Assets" are defined as net assets
including the liquidation preference amount of the DARTS plus borrowings
for investment purposes. The Fund will notify shareholders at least 60 days
prior to any change in this 80% investment policy.

By-laws

In November 2002, the Board of Trustees adopted several amendments to the
Fund's by-laws, including provisions relating to the calling of a special
meeting and requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals or nominees
for Trustee. The advance notice provisions in the by-laws require
shareholders to notify the Fund in writing of any proposal that they intend
to present at an annual meeting of share- holders, including any
nominations for Trustee, between 90 and 120 days prior to the first
anniversary of the mailing date of the notice from the prior year's annual
meeting of shareholders. The notification must be in the form prescribed by
the by-laws. The advance notice provisions provide the Fund and its
Trustees with the opportunity to thoughtfully consider and address the
matters proposed before the Fund prepares and mails its proxy statement to
shareholders. Other amendments set forth the procedures that must be
followed in order for a shareholder to call a special meeting of
shareholders. Please contact the Secretary of the Fund for additional
information about the advance notice requirements or the other amendments
to the by-laws.

On December 16, 2003, the Trustees approved the following change to the
Fund's by-laws. The auction preferred section of the Fund's by-laws was
changed to update the rating agency requirements, in keeping with recent
changes to the agencies' basic maintenance reporting requirements for
leveraged closed-end funds. By-laws now require an independent accountant's
confirmation only once per year, at the Fund's fiscal year end, and changes
to the agencies' basic maintenance reporting requirements that include
modifications to the eligible assets and their respective discount factors.
These revisions bring the Fund's by-laws in line with current rating agency
requirements.

On September 14, 2004, the Trustees approved an amendment to the Fund's


22
<PAGE>


by-laws increasing the maximum applicable dividend rate ceiling on the
preferred shares to conform with the modern calculation methodology used by
the industry and other John Hancock funds.

Dividend
reinvestment plan

The Fund offers its shareholders a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"),
which offers the opportunity to earn compounded yields. Each holder of
common shares may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital
gains reinvested by Mellon Investor Services, as plan agent for the common
shareholders (the "Plan Agent"). Holders of common shares who do not elect
to participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash, paid by
check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the common
shares are held in street or other nominee name, then to the nominee) by
the Plan Agent, as dividend disbursing agent.

Shareholders may join the Plan by filling out and mailing an authorization
card, by notifying the Plan Agent by telephone, or by visiting the Plan
Agent's Web site at www.melloninvestor.com. Shareholders must indicate an
election to reinvest all or a portion of dividend payments. If received in
proper form by the Plan Agent before the record date of a dividend, the
election will be effective with respect to all dividends paid after such
record date. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or
nominee should contact the broker or nominee to determine whether and how
they may participate in the Plan.

If the Fund declares a dividend payable either in common shares or in cash,
non-participants will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in common shares. If the market price of the common
shares on the payment date of the dividend is equal to or exceeds their net
asset value as determined on the payment date, participants will be issued
common shares (out of authorized but unissued shares) at a value equal to
the higher of net asset value or 95% of the market price. If the net asset
value exceeds the market price of the common shares at such time, or if the
Board of Trustees declares a dividend payable only in cash, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for Plan participants, buy shares in the open market, on the
New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. Such
purchases will be made promptly after the payable date for such dividend
and, in any event, prior to the next ex-dividend date after such date,
except where necessary to comply with federal securities laws. If, before
the Plan Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the
net asset value of the common shares, the average per share purchase price
paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the common shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund.

Each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in
connection with the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. In each
case, the cost per share of the shares purchased for each participant's
account will be the average cost, including brokerage commissions, of any
shares purchased on the open market plus the cost of any shares issued by
the Fund. There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares
issued directly by the Fund. There are no other charges to participants for
reinvesting dividends or capital gain distributions.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan at any time by contacting
the Plan Agent by telephone, in writing or by visiting the Plan Agent's Web
site at www.melloninvestor.com. Such withdrawal will be effective immediately
if received not less than ten days prior to a dividend record date; otherwise,
it will be effective for all subsequent dividend record dates.  When


23
<PAGE>


a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of the Plan, as
provided below, certificates for whole common shares credited to his or her
account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any
fraction of a share credited to such account.

The Plan Agent maintains each shareholder's account in the Plan and
furnishes monthly written confirmations of all transactions in the
accounts, including information needed by the shareholders for personal and
tax records. The Plan Agent will hold common shares in the account of each
Plan participant in noncertificated form in the name of the participant.
Proxy material relating to the shareholders' meetings of the Fund will
include those shares purchased as well as shares held pursuant to the Plan.

The reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any federal income tax that may be payable or required to
be withheld on such dividends or distributions. Participants under the Plan
will receive tax information annually. The amount of dividend to be
reported on 1099-DIV should be (1) in the case of shares issued by the
Fund, the fair market value of such shares on the dividend payment date and
(2) in the case of shares purchased by the Plan Agent in the open market,
the amount of cash used by the Plan Agent to purchase shares in the open
market, including the amount of cash allocated to brokerage commissions
paid on such purchases.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice
of the change sent to all shareholders of the Fund at least 90 days before
the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan may be amended
or terminated by the Plan Agent after at least 90 days' written notice to
all shareholders of the Fund. All correspondence or additional information
concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent, Mellon Bank,
N.A., c/o Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ
07606-1938 (telephone 1-800-852-0218).

ITEM 2.  CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period, October 31, 2004, the registrant has adopted a
code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR, that applies to its
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
(respectively, the principal executive officer, the principal financial
officer and the principal accounting officer, the "Senior Financial
Officers"). A copy of the code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this
Form N-CSR.

ITEM 3.  AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

Charles L. Ladner is the audit committee financial expert and is
"independent", pursuant to general instructions on Form N-CSR Item 3.

ITEM 4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

(a) Audit Fees

The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by the
principal accountant(s) for the audit of the registrant's annual financial
statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant(s) in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements amounted to
$29,750 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003 and $31,250 for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. These fees were billed to the
registrant and were approved by the registrant's audit committee.

(b) Audit-Related Services

There were no audit-related fees during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2003 and fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 billed to the registrant or to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that provides
ongoing services to the registrant ("control affiliates").

(c) Tax Fees

The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by the
principal accountant(s) for the tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning
("tax fees") amounted to $2,100 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003
and $2,250 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. The nature of the
services comprising the tax fees was the review of the registrant's income
tax returns and tax distribution requirements. These fees were billed to
the registrant and were approved by the registrant's audit committee. There
were no tax fees billed to the control affiliates.

(d) All Other Fees

The all other fees billed to the registrant for products and services
provided by the principal accountant were $21,700 for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2003 and $4,000 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004.
There were no other fees during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003 and
October 31, 2004 billed to control affiliates for products and services
provided by the principal accountant. The nature of the services comprising
the all other fees was related to the principal accountant's report on the
registrant's Eligible Asset Coverage. These fees were approved by the
registrant's audit committee.

(e)(1) See attachment "Approval of Audit, Audit-related, Tax and Other
Services", with the audit committee pre-approval policies and procedures.

(e)(2) There were no fees that were approved by the audit committee
pursuant to the de minimis exception for the fiscal years ended October 31,
2003 and October 31, 2004 on behalf of the registrant or on behalf of the
control affiliates that relate directly to the operations and financial
reporting of the registrant.

(f) According to the registrant's principal accountant, for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2004, the percentage of hours spent on the audit of the
registrant's financial statements for the most recent fiscal year that were
attributed to work performed by persons who were not full-time, permanent
employees of principal accountant was less than 50%.

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant(s)
for services rendered to the registrant and rendered to the registrant's
control affiliates for each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant
were $149,700 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003, and $2,250 for
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004.

(h) The audit committee of the registrant has considered the non-audit
services provided by the registrant's principal accountant(s) to the
control affiliates and has determined that the services that were not
pre-approved are compatible with maintaining the principal accountant(s)'
independence.

comprised of independent trustees. The members of the audit committee are
as follows:

Charles L. Ladner

1.  General Principles

Each person within the John Hancock Funds organization is responsible for
maintaining the very highest ethical standards when conducting business. This
means that:

     o    You have a duty at all times to place  the  interests  of our  clients
          first.
     o    All  of  your  personal  securities  transactions  must  be  conducted
          consistent  with this code of ethics  and in such a manner as to avoid
          any actual or  potential  conflict  of interest or other abuse of your
          position of trust and responsibility.
     o    You should not take inappropriate advantage of your position or engage
          in any fraudulent or manipulative  practice (such as  front-running or
          manipulative market timing) with respect to our clients' accounts.

2.  To Whom Does This Code Apply?

This code of ethics applies to you if you are a director, officer or employee of
John Hancock Advisers, LLC, Sovereign Asset Management Co., John Hancock Funds,
LLC or a "John Hancock fund" (any fund or account advised by John Hancock
Advisers, LLC). It also applies to you if you are an employee of John Hancock
Life Insurance Co. or its subsidiaries who participates in making
recommendations for, or receives information about, portfolio trades of the John
Hancock funds. Please note that if a policy described below applies to you, it
applies to your personal accounts, those of a spouse, "significant other," minor
children or family members sharing a household, as well as all accounts over
which you have discretion or give advice or information. "Significant others"
are defined for these purposes as two people who (1) share the same primary
residence; (2) share living expenses; and (3) are in a committed relationship
and intend to remain in the relationship indefinitely.

There are three main categories for persons covered by this code of ethics,
taking into account their positions, duties and access to information regarding
fund portfolio trades. You have been notified about which of these categories
applies to you, based on the Compliance Department's understanding of your
current role. If you have a level of investment access beyond your assigned
category, or if you are promoted or change duties and as a result should more
appropriately be included in a different category, it is your responsibility to
notify Tim Fagan, Assistant Investment Compliance Officer.

The basic definitions of the three main categories, with examples, are provided
below. The more detailed definitions of each category are attached as Appendix
A.

4.  Policies Outside the Code of Ethics

John Hancock Funds has certain policies that are not part of the code of ethics,
but are equally important. The two most important of these policies are (1) the
Company Conflict and Business Practice Policy; and (2) the Inside Information
Policy.

>>  Company Conflict & Business Practice Policy

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
             Regular Access Persons
             Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

A conflict of interest  occurs when your  private  interests  interfere or could
potentially  interfere  with your  responsibilities  at work. You must not place
yourself or the company in a Non-Access  Persons position of actual or potential
conflict.

This Policy covers a number of important issues. For example, you cannot serve
as a director of any company without first obtaining the required written
executive approval.

Other important issues in this Policy include:
o   personal investments or business relationships
o   misuse of inside information
o   receiving or giving of gifts, entertainment or favors
o   misuse or misrepresentation of your corporate position
o   disclosure of confidential or proprietary information
o   antitrust activities
o   political campaign contributions and expenditures on public officials

>>  Inside Information Policy and Procedures

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
             Regular Access Persons
             Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

The  antifraud  provisions of the federal  securities  laws  generally  prohibit
persons with material  non-public  information  from trading on or communicating
the   information  to  others.   Sanctions  for  violations  can  include  civil
injunctions,  permanent bars from the securities industry, civil penalties up to
three  times  the  profits  made or  losses  avoided,  criminal  fines  and jail
sentences.  While  Investment  Access persons are most likely to come in contact
with material  non-public  information,  the rules (and  sanctions) in this area
apply to all John Hancock Funds  personnel and extend to activities both related
and unrelated to your job duties.

The  Inside  Information  Policy  and  Procedures  covers a number of  important
issues, such as: o The misuse of material non-public information

o   The information  barrier  procedure o The "restricted  list" and the "watch
    list"
o   broker letters and duplicate confirmation statements (see section 6 of this
    code of ethics)

                                                                               4
<PAGE>


5.  Policies in the Code of Ethics

>>  Restriction on Gifts

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
             Regular Access Persons
             Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

You and  your  family  cannot  accept  preferential  treatment  or  favors  from
securities  brokers or dealers or other  organizations  with which John  Hancock
Funds might transact business except in accordance with the Company Conflict and
Business Practice Policy. For the protection of both you and John Hancock Funds,
the  appearance of a possible  conflict of interest must be avoided.  You should
exercise  caution in any instance in which business  travel and lodging are paid
for by someone other than John Hancock  Funds.  The purpose of this policy is to
minimize the basis for any charge that you used your John Hancock Funds position
to obtain for yourself  opportunities  which  otherwise  would not be offered to
you.   Please  see  the  Company   Conflict  and  Business   Practice   Policy's
"Compensation and Gifts" section for additional  details regarding  restrictions
on gifts and exceptions for "nominal value" gifts.

>>  Preclearance of Securities Transactions

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
             Regular Access Persons

Also, for a limited category of trades:
            --------------------------
                Non-Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an  Investment  Access  person or  Regular  Access  person,  you must
"preclear"  (i.e.:   receive  advance  approval  of)  any  personal   securities
transactions.

"significant other," minor children or family members sharing your household, as
well  as all  accounts  over  which  you  have  discretion  or  give  advice  or
information.  Due to this preclearance requirement,  participation in investment
clubs is prohibited.

Preclearance of private placements requires some special considerations--the
decision will take into account whether, for example: (1) the investment
opportunity should be reserved for John Hancock Funds clients; and (2) it is
being offered to you because of your position with John Hancock Funds.

The  following  securities  are  exempt  from the  preclear  policy:  (1) direct
obligations of the U.S. Government, (2) shares of open-end mutual funds that are
not advised by John  Hancock  Advisers,  LLC,  (3)  bankers'  acceptances,  bank
certificates  of  deposit,  commercial  paper  & high  quality  short-term  debt
instruments, including repurchase agreements. ***Please note that, effective May
1, 2004, if you are an Investment  Access person or Regular Access  person,  you
now must  preclear  shares of  open-end  mutual  funds that are  advised by John
Hancock  Advisers,  LLC  (excluding  the money  market  funds  and any  dividend
reinvestment,  payroll deduction, systematic  investment/withdrawal,  investment
election changes in the 401(k) plans and other program trades).***

If you are a Non-Access person, you must preclear transactions in securities of
any closed-end funds advised by John Hancock Advisers, LLC. A Non-Access person
is not required to preclear other trades. However, please keep in mind that a
Non-Access person is required to report securities transactions after every
trade (even those that are not required to be precleared) by submitting
duplicate confirmation statements, as described in section 6 of this code of
ethics.

                                                                               5
<PAGE>


The preclearance policy is designed to proactively identify possible "problem
trades" that raise front-running, manipulative market timing or other conflict
of interest concerns (example: when an Investment Access person trades a
security on the same day as a John Hancock fund). Please keep in mind that even
if you receive a preclearance, or are exempt from preclearing a securities
transaction, you are still prohibited from engaging in any fraud or manipulative
practice (such as front-running or manipulative market timing) with respect to a
John Hancock fund.

You preclear a trade by following the steps outlined in the preclearance
procedures, which are attached as Appendix B. Please note that: o You may not
trade until clearance is received.

o   Clearance approval is valid only for the date granted (i.e. the
    preclearance date and the trade date should be the same. However, for
    preclearance of John Hancock mutual funds, the preclearance date may be
    the trade date or the order submission date) .

o   A separate procedure should be followed for requesting preclearance of a
    private placement or a derivative, as detailed in Appendix B. The
    Compliance Department must maintain a five-year record of all clearances
    of private placement purchases by Investment Access persons, and the
    reasons supporting the clearances.


>>  Ban on Short-Term Profits

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an Investment Access person,  you cannot profit from the purchase and
sale (or sale and  purchase) of the same (or  equivalent)  securities  within 60
calendar  days.  The  purpose  of this  policy is to address  the risk,  real or
perceived,  of  front-running,  manipulative  market  timing  or  other  abusive
practices  involving  short-term  personal  trading.  Any  profits  realized  on
short-term trades must be surrendered by check payable to John Hancock Advisers,
LLC and will be contributed by John Hancock Advisers, LLC to a charity.

This policy applies to trades for your personal accounts, those of a spouse,
"significant other," minor children or family members sharing a household, as
well as all accounts over which you have discretion or give advice or
information. If you give away a security, it is considered a sale.

The following securities are exempt from this ban on short-term profits: (1)
direct obligations of the U.S. Government, (2) shares of open-end mutual funds
that are not advised by John Hancock Advisers, LLC, (3) bankers' acceptances,
bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper & high quality short-term debt
instruments, including repurchase agreements. ***Please note that, effective May
1, 2004, the short-term profit ban for Investment Access persons now applies to
shares of open-end mutual funds that are advised by John Hancock Advisers, LLC
(excluding the money market funds and any dividend reinvestment, payroll
deduction, systematic investment/withdrawal, investment election changes in the
401(k) plans and other program trades).***

You may invest in derivatives or sell short provided the transaction period
exceeds the 60-day holding period.

                                                                               6
<PAGE>


You may request an exemption from this policy for involuntary sales due to
unforeseen corporate activity (such as a merger), or hardship reasons (such as
unexpected medical expenses) by sending an e-mail to Tim Fagan, Assistant
Investment Compliance Officer.


>>  Ban on IPOs

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are an Investment  Access  person,  you may not acquire  securities in an
initial public offering. You may not purchase any newly-issued  securities until
the next business  (trading) day after the offering date. This policy applies to
trades for your personal accounts, those of a spouse, "significant other," minor
children or family members sharing your household,  as well as all accounts over
which you have discretion or give advice or information.

There are two main reasons for this prohibition: (1) these purchases may suggest
that persons have taken inappropriate advantage of their positions for personal
profit; and (2) these purchases may create at least the appearance that an
investment opportunity that should have been available to the John Hancock funds
was diverted to the personal benefit of an individual employee.

You may request an exemption for certain investments that do not create a
potential conflict of interest, such as: (1) securities of a mutual bank or
mutual insurance company received as compensation in a demutualization and other
similar non-voluntary stock acquisitions; or (2) fixed rights offerings.


>>  Disclosure of Private Placement Conflicts

- ----------------------------------------

Applies to:  Investment Access Persons

- ----------------------------------------

If you are an  Investment  Access person and you own  securities  purchased in a
private  placement,  you must  disclose that holding when you  participate  in a
decision to purchase or sell that same  issuer's  securities  for a John Hancock
fund.  Private  placements are  securities  exempt from SEC  registration  under
section 4(2), section 4(6) or rules 504 -506 of the Securities Act of 1933.

The investment decision must be subject to an independent review by investment
personnel with no personal interest in the issuer. This policy applies to
holdings in your personal accounts, those of a spouse, "significant other,"
minor children or family members sharing your household, as well as all accounts
over which you have discretion or give advice or information.

The purpose of this policy is to provide appropriate scrutiny in situations in
which there is a potential conflict of interest.

                                                                               7
<PAGE>


>>  Seven Day Blackout Period

- ----------------------------------------
Applies to:  Investment Access Persons
- ----------------------------------------

If you are a portfolio manager (or were identified to the Compliance  Department
as part of a  portfolio  management  team)  you are  prohibited  from  buying or
selling a security  within seven calendar days before and after that security is
traded for a fund that you  manage  unless no  conflict  of  interest  exists in
relation to that security.

In addition, all investment access persons are prohibited from knowingly buying
or selling a security within seven calendar days before and after that security
is traded for a John Hancock fund unless no conflict of interest exists in
relation to that security. If a John Hancock fund trades in a security within
seven calendar days before or after you trade in that security, you may be
required to demonstrate that you did not know that the trade was being
considered for that John Hancock fund.

unless it is determined that no conflict of interest exists in relation to that
security. Any profits realized on trades during a seven day blackout period must
be surrendered by check payable to John Hancock Advisers, LLC and will be
contributed by John Hancock Advisers, LLC to a charity.

This policy applies to holdings in your personal accounts, those of a spouse,
"significant other" or family members sharing your household, as well as all
accounts over which you have discretion or give advice or information.

Hancock funds who:

        (b) do not ordinarily obtain information about fund portfolio trades.

A more detailed definition of Limited Access persons, and a list of the policies
that apply to them, is attached as Appendix C.

9.  Subadvisers

A subadviser to a John Hancock fund has a number of responsibilities under this
code of ethics, as described in Appendix D.

10. Reporting Violations

If you know of any violation of our code of ethics, you have a responsibility to
immediately report it. You should also report any deviations from the controls
and procedures that safeguard John Hancock Funds and the assets of our clients.

You can report confidentially to:

o   Tim Fagan (375-6205); or Susan Newton (375-1702) or
o   Your manager or department head

                                                                              10
<PAGE>


11. Interpretation and Enforcement

This code of ethics cannot anticipate every situation in which personal
interests may be in conflict with the interests of our clients. You should be
responsive to the spirit and intent of this code of ethics as well as its
specific provisions.

When any doubt exists regarding any code of ethics provision or whether a
conflict of interest with clients might exist, you should discuss the
transaction beforehand with the Legal Department (contacts: Tim Fagan (375-6205)
or Susan Newton (375-1702)). The code of ethics is designed to detect and
prevent fraud against clients and fund investors, and to avoid the appearance of
impropriety. If you feel inequitably burdened by any policy, you should feel
free to contact Susan Newton or the Ethics and Business Practices Committee.
Exceptions may be granted where warranted by applicable facts and circumstances.

To provide assurance that policies are effective, the Compliance Department will
monitor and check personal securities transaction reports and certifications
against fund portfolio transactions. Other internal auditing procedures may be
adopted from time to time. Additional administration and recordkeeping
procedures are described in Appendix E.

The Ethics and Business Practices Committee of John Hancock Funds has general
responsibility for this code of ethics. The Legal Department will refer
violations to the Ethics and Business Practices Committee for review and
appropriate action. The following factors will be considered when the Ethics and
Business Practices Committee determines a fine or other disciplinary action:

o   the  person's  position  and function  (senior  personnel  may be held to a
    higher standard);
o   the amount of the trade;  o whether the funds or accounts hold the security
    and were  trading  the same day; o whether  the  violation  was by a family
    member.
o   whether the person has had a prior violation and which policy was involved.
o   whether the employee self-reported the violation.

You can request reconsideration of any disciplinary action by submitting a
written request to the Ethics and Business Practices Committee.

No less frequently than annually, a written report of all material violations
and sanctions, significant conflicts of interest and other related issues will
be submitted to the boards of directors of the John Hancock funds for their
review. Sanctions for violations could include fines, limitation of personal
trading activity, suspension or termination of the violator's position with John
Hancock Funds and/or a report to the appropriate regulatory authority.

                                                                              11

Appendix B: Preclearance Procedures

                                 CODE OF ETHICS
                            PRE-CLEARANCE PROCEDURES


You should read the Code of Ethics to determine whether you must obtain a
preclearance before you enter into a securities transaction. If you are required
to obtain a preclearance, you should follow the procedures detailed below.

1. Pre-clearance for Public Securities including Derivatives, Futures, Options
and Selling Short:

A request to pre-clear should be entered into the John Hancock Personal Trading
& Reporting System.

The John Hancock Personal Trading & Reporting System is located under your Start
Menu on your Desktop. It can be accessed by going to JH Applications/Personal
Trading & Reporting/ Personal Trading & Reporting and by entering your Web
Security Services user id and password.
If JH Applications or the John Hancock Personal Trading & Reporting System is
not on your Desktop, please contact the HELP Desk at (617) 375-4357 for
assistance.

The Trade Request Screen:

At times you may receive a message like "System is currently unavailable". The
system is scheduled to be offline from 8:00 PM until 7:00 AM each night.

Ticker/Security Cusip: Fill in this one of these fields with the proper
information of the security you want to buy or sell. Then click the [Lookup]
button. Select one of the hyperlinks for the desired security, and the system
will populate the proper fields Ticker, Security Cusip, Security Name and
Security Type automatically on the Trade Request Screen.

If You Don't Know the Ticker, Cusip, or Security Name:

If you do not know the full ticker, you may type in the first few letters
followed by an asterisk * and click the [Lookup] button. For example, let's say
you want to buy some shares of Intel, but all you can remember of the ticker is
that it begins with int, so you enter int* for Ticker. If any tickers beginning
with int are found, they are displayed on a new screen. Select the hyperlink of
the one you want, and the system will populate Security Cusip, Security Name and
Security Type automatically on the Trade Request Screen. If you do not know the
full cusip, you may type in the first few numbers followed by an asterisk * and
click the [Lookup] button. For example, let's say you want to buy some shares of
Microsoft, but all you can remember of the cusip is that it begins with 594918,
so you enter 594918* for Ticker. If any cusips beginning with 594918 are found,
they are displayed on a new screen. Select the hyperlink of the one you want,
and the system will fill in Ticker, Security Name and Security Type
automatically on the Trade Request Screen. If you do not know the Ticker but
have an idea of what the Security Name is, you may type in an asterisk, a few
letters of the name and an asterisk * and click the [Lookup] button. For
example, let's say you want to buy some shares of American Brands, so you enter
*amer* for Security Name. Any securities whose names have amer in them are
displayed on a new screen, where you are asked to select the hyperlink of the
one you want, and the system will fill in Ticker, Cusip and Security Type
automatically on the Trade Request Screen.

Other Items on the Trade Request Screen:

Brokerage  Account:  Click on the dropdown  arrow to the right of the  Brokerage
Account field to choose the account to be used for the trade.
Transaction Type: Choose one of the values displayed when you click the dropdown
arrow to the right of this field.
Trade Date: You may only submit trade requests for the current date.

Note:  One or more of these fields may not appear on the Request Entry screen if
the  information  is  not  required.  Required  fields  are  determined  by  the
compliance department.

Click the [Submit Request] button to send the trade request to your compliance
department.

Once you click the [Submit Request] button, you will be asked to confirm the
values you have entered. Review the information and click the [Confirm] button
if all the information is correct. After which, you will receive immediate
feedback in your web browser. (Note: We suggest that you print out this
confirmation and keep it as a record of the trade you have made). After this,
you can either submit another trade request or logout.

                                                                              14
<PAGE>


Attention Investment Access Persons: If the system identifies a potential
violation of the Ban on Short Term Profits Rule, your request will be sent to
the Compliance Department for review and you will receive feedback via the
e-mail system.

Starting Over:

To clear everything on the screen and start over, click the [Clear Screen]
button.

Exiting Without Submitting the Trade Request:

If you decide not to submit the trade request before clicking the [Submit
Request] button, simply exit from the browser by clicking the [X] button on the
upper right or by pressing [Alt+F4], or by clicking the Logout hyperlink on the
lower left side of the screen.

Ticker/Security Name Lookup Screen:

You arrive at this screen from the Trade Request Screen, where you've clicked
the [Lookup] button (see above, "If You Don't Know the Ticker, Cusip, or
Security Name"). If you see the security you want to trade, you simply select
its corresponding hyperlink, and you will automatically return to the Trade
Request Screen, where you finish making your trade request. If the security you
want to trade is not shown, that means that it is not recognized by the system
under the criteria you used to look it up. Keep searching under other names
(click the [Return to Request] button) until you are sure that the security is
not in the system. If you determine that the desired security is not in the
system, please contact a member of the compliance department to add the security
for you. Contacts are listed below:

Fred Spring x54987

Adding Brokerage Accounts:

To access this functionality, click on the Add Brokerage Account hyperlink on
the left frame of your browser screen. You will be prompted to enter the
Brokerage Account Number, Brokerage Account Name, Date Opened, and Broker. When
you click the [Create New Brokerage Account] button, you will receive a message
that informs you whether the account was successfully created.

                                                                              15
<PAGE>


3.  Pre-clearance for Private Placements and Initial Public Offerings:

You may request a preclearance of private placement securities or an Initial
Public Offering by contacting Fred Spring via Microsoft Outlook (please "cc."
Tim Fagan on all such requests). Please keep in mind that the code of ethics
prohibits Investment Access persons from purchasing securities in an initial
public offering.

The request must include:

|_| the associate's name;
|_| the associate's John Hancock Funds' company;
|_| the complete name of the security;
|_| the seller and whether or not the seller is one with whom the associate does
    business on a regular basis; |_| any potential conflict, present or future,
    with fund trading activity and whether the security might be offered as
    inducement to later recommend publicly traded securities for any fund; and
|_| the date of the request.

Clearance of private placements or initial public offerings may be denied if the
transaction could create the appearance of impropriety. Clearance of initial
public offerings will also be denied if the transaction is prohibited for a
person due to his or her access category under the code of ethics.

                                                                              16

        (ii) a John Hancock fund or John Hancock Advisers, LLC considered

        a spouse, "significant other" or family members sharing your
        household, as well as all accounts over which you have discretion
        or give advice or information. If this situation occurs, it is your

        the requirements of the quarterly transaction report.

code of ethics.

>>  Approval of Code of Ethics

Each subadviser to a John Hancock fund must provide a copy of its code of ethics
to the trustees of the relevant John Hancock funds for approval initially and

two other public companies (other than another John Hancock Fund).  Except as
otherwise permitted by the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
each member of the Audit Committee shall be independent as defined by such
NYSE rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.  Each member of the Audit
Committee must be financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted
by the Board of Trustees in its business judgment, or must become financially
literate within a reasonable period of time after his or her appointment to
the Audit Committee.  At least one member of the Audit Committee must have
accounting or related financial management expertise, as the Board of Trustees
interprets such qualification in its business judgment.

B. Overview.  The Audit Committee's purpose is to:

1. assist the Board of Trustee's oversight of (1) the integrity of the funds'
financial statements, (2) the funds' compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements (except to the extent such responsibility is delegated to another
committee), (3) the independent auditor's qualifications and independence, and
(4) the performance of the funds' internal audit function and independent
auditors;

2. act as a liaison between the funds' independent accountants and the full
Board; and

3. prepare an Audit Committee Report as required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") to the extent required to be included in the
funds' annual proxy statement or other filings.

The Audit Committee shall discharge its responsibilities, and shall access the
information provided by the funds' management and independent auditors, in
accordance with its business judgment.  Management is responsible for the
preparation of the fund's financial statements and the independent auditors
are responsible for auditing those financial statements.  The Audit Committee
and the Board of Trustees recognize that management (including the internal
audit staff) and the independent auditors have more experience, expertise,
resources and time, and more detailed knowledge and information regarding a
fund's accounting, auditing, internal control and financial reporting
practices than the Audit Committee does.  Accordingly, the Audit Committee's
oversight role does not provide any expert or special assurance as to the
financial statements and other financial information provided by a fund to its
shareholders and others.  The independent auditors are responsible for
auditing the funds' financial statements and for reviewing the funds'
unaudited interim financial statements.  The authority and responsibilities
set forth in this charter do not reflect or create any duty or obligation of
the Audit Committee to plan or conduct any audit, to determine or certify that
any fund's financial statements are complete, accurate, fairly presented, or
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or applicable law,
or to guarantee any independent auditor's report.

C. Oversight.  The independent auditors shall report directly to the Audit
Committee, and the Audit Committee shall be directly responsible for oversight
of the work of the independent auditors, including resolution of disagreements
between any fund's management and the independent auditors regarding financial
reporting.  In connection with its oversight role, the Audit Committee should
also review with the independent auditors, from time to time as appropriate:
significant risks and uncertainties with respect to the quality, accuracy or
fairness of presentation of a fund's financial statements; recently disclosed
problems with respect to the quality, accuracy or fairness of presentation of
the financial statements of companies similarly situated to the funds and
recommended actions which might be taken to prevent or mitigate the risk of
problems at the funds arising from such matters; accounting for unusual
transactions; adjustments arising from audits that could have a significant
impact on the funds' financial reporting process; and any recent SEC comments
on the funds' SEC reports, including, in particular, any compliance comments.
The Audit Committee should inquire of the independent auditor concerning the
quality, not just the acceptability, of the funds' accounting determinations
and other judgmental areas and question whether management's choices of
accounting principles are, as a whole, conservative, moderate or aggressive.

D. Specific Responsibilities.  The Audit Committee shall have the following
duties and powers, to be exercised at such times and in such manner as the
Committee shall deem necessary or appropriate:

1. To oversee the funds' auditing and accounting process.

2. To approve, and recommend to the full Board of Trustees for its
ratification and approval in accord with applicable law, the selection,
appointment, retention and compensation of an independent auditor for each
fund prior to the engagement of such independent auditor.  The Committee
should meet with the independent auditor prior to the audit to discuss the
planning and staffing of the audit. The Committee should periodically consider
whether, in order to assure continuing auditor independence, there should be
regular rotation of the independent audit firm and obtain and review a copy of
the most recent report on the independent auditor issued by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board pursuant to Section 104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

3. To periodically review and evaluate the lead partner and other senior
members of the independent auditor's team and confirm the regular rotation of
the lead audit partner and reviewing partner as required by Section 203 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

4. To confirm that the officers of the funds were not employed by the
independent auditor, or if employed, did not participate in any capacity in
the audit of the funds, in each case, during the one-audit-year period
preceding the date of initiation of the audit, as required by Section 206 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

5. To pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided to each fund by
its independent auditor, directly or by establishing pre-approval policies and
procedures pursuant to which such services may be rendered, provided however,
that any such policies and procedures are detailed as to particular services,
the Audit Committee is informed of each service, and any such policies and
procedures do not include the delegation of the Audit Committee's
responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or applicable rules
or listing requirements.  The Committees should periodically compare the fees
paid for audit services to those paid by peer companies as a means of
assessing whether the scope of audit work is sufficient.

6. To pre-approve all non-audit services provided by a fund's independent
auditor to the fund's investment adviser and any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
provides ongoing services to the fund, if the engagement relates directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the fund.  The Committee is
authorized to delegate, to the extent permitted by law, pre-approval
responsibilities to one or more members of the Committee who shall report to
the Committee regarding approved services at the Committee's next regularly
scheduled meeting.  The Committee is also authorized to adopt policies and
procedures which govern the pre-approval of audit, audit-related, tax and
other services provided by the independent accountants to the funds.

7. To monitor the independent auditor of each fund throughout the engagement
to attempt to identify: conflicts of interest between management and the
independent auditor as a result of employment relationships; the provision of
prohibited non-audit services to a fund by its independent auditor; violations
of audit partner rotation requirements; and prohibited independent auditor
compensation arrangements whereby individuals employed by the auditor are
compensated based on selling non-audit services to the fund.  The independent
auditors should promptly contact the Audit Committee or its Chair about any
significant issue or disagreement concerning a fund's accounting practices or
financial statements that is not resolved to their satisfaction or if Section
10A(b) of the Exchange Act has been implicated.

8. To meet with independent auditors, including private meetings, as
necessary, management's internal auditors, and the funds' senior management
(i) to review the arrangements for and scope of the annual audit and any
special audits; (ii) to review the form and substance of the funds' financial
statements and reports, including each fund's disclosures under "Management's
Discussion of Fund Performance" and to discuss any matters of concern relating
to the funds' financial statements, including any adjustments to such
statements recommended by the independent accountants, or other results of an
audit; (iii) to consider the independent accountants' comments with respect to
the funds' financial policies, procedures and internal accounting controls and
management's responses thereto; (iv) to review the resolution of any
disagreements between the independent accountants and management regarding the
funds' financial reporting; and (v) to review the form of opinion the
independent accountants propose to render to the Board and shareholders. The
Audit Committee should request from the independent auditors a frank
assessment of management.

9. With respect to any listed fund, to consider whether it will recommend to
the Board of Trustees that the audited financial statements be included in a
fund's annual report.  The Board delegates to the Audit Committee the
authority to release the funds' financial statements for publication in the
annual and semi-annual report, subject to the Board's right to review and
ratify such financial statements following publication.  With respect to each
fund, to review and discuss with each fund's management and independent
auditor the funds' audited financial statements and the matters about which
Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing
Standards, AU 380) requires discussion.  The Audit Committee shall prepare an
annual committee report for inclusion where necessary in the proxy statement
of a fund relating to its annual meeting of security holders or in any other
filing required by the SEC's rules.

10. To receive and consider reports on the audit functions of the independent
auditors and the extent and quality of their auditing programs.

11. To oversee the adoption and implementation of any codes of ethics required
under applicable law.

12. To obtain and review, at least annually, a report by the independent
auditor describing: the firm's internal quality-control procedures; any
material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or
peer review, of the firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental
or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one
or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to
deal with any such issues; and, to access the auditor's independence, all
relationships between the independent auditor and each fund, including the
disclosures required by any applicable Independence Standards Board Standard
No. 1.  The Audit Committee shall engage in an active dialogue with each
independent auditor concerning any disclosed relationships or services that
might impact the objectivity and independence of the auditor.

13. To review with the independent auditor any problems that may be reported
to it arising out of a fund's accounting, auditing or financial reporting
functions and management's response, and to receive and consider reports on
critical accounting policies and practices and alternative treatments
discussed with management.

14. To review the procedures for allocating fund brokerage, the allocation of
trades among various accounts under management and the fees and other charges
for fund brokerage.

15. To receive and consider reports from the independent auditors regarding
reviews of the operating and internal control structure of custodian banks and
transfer agents, including procedures to safeguard fund assets.

16. To monitor securities pricing procedures and review their implementation
with management, management's internal auditors, independent auditors and
others as may be required.

17. To establish and monitor, or cause to be established and monitored,
procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by
a fund regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing
matters, and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the
investment adviser, administrator, principal underwriter or any other provider
of accounting related services for a listed fund, as well as employees of the
fund regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, as and when
required by applicable rules or listing requirements.  The procedures
currently in effect are attached as Exhibit A.

18. To report regularly to the Board of Trustees, including the Audit
Committee's conclusions with respect to the independent auditor and the funds'
financial statements and accounting controls.

E. Subcommittees.  The Audit Committee may, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, form and delegate authority to one or more subcommittees
(including a subcommittee consisting of a single member), as it deems
appropriate from time to time under the circumstances.  Any decision of a
subcommittee to preapprove audit or non-audit services shall be presented to
the full Audit Committee at its next meeting.

F. Additional Responsibilities.  The Committee shall serve as the "qualified
legal compliance committee" (as such term is defined in 17 CFR Part
205)("QLCC"), the duties of which are listed on Exhibit B to this charter; and
shall also perform other tasks assigned to it from time to time by the
Administration Committee or the full Board, and will report findings and
recommendations to the Administration Committee or the full Board, as
appropriate.

G. Funding.  Each fund shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by
the Audit Committee, in its capacity as a committee of the Board of Trustees,
for payment of:

1. Compensation to any registered public accounting firm engaged for the
purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit,
review or attest services for the fund.

2. Compensation to any advisers employed by the Audit Committee under its
authority to engage independent counsel and other advisers.

3. Ordinary administrative expenses of the Audit Committee that are necessary
or appropriate in carrying out its duties.

H. Governance.  One member of the Committee shall be appointed as chair.  The
chair shall be responsible for leadership of the Committee, including
scheduling meetings or reviewing and approving the schedule for them,
preparing agendas or reviewing and approving them before meetings, presiding
over meetings, and making reports to the Administration Committee or the full
Board, as appropriate.  The designation of a person as an "audit committee
financial expert", within the meaning of the rules under Section 407 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, shall not impose any greater responsibility or
liability on that person than the responsibility and liability imposed on such
person as a member of the Committee, nor shall it decrease the duties and
obligations of other Committee members or the Board. The compensation of Audit
Committee members shall be as determined by the Board of Trustees.  No member
of the Audit Committee may receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting,
advisory or other compensatory fee from a fund, other than fees paid in his or
her capacity as a member of the Board of Trustees or a committee of the Board.
The members of the Audit Committee should confirm that the minutes of the
Audit Committee's meetings accurately describe the issues considered by the
Committee, the process the Committee used to discuss and evaluate such issues
and the Committee's final determination of how to proceed.  The minutes should
document the Committee's consideration of issues in a manner that demonstrates
that the Committee acted with due care.

I. Evaluation.  At least annually, the Audit Committee evaluate its own
performance, including whether the Audit Committee is meeting frequently
enough to discharge its responsibilities appropriately.

J. Miscellaneous.  The Committee shall meet as often as it deems appropriate,
with or without management, as circumstances require.  The Committee shall
have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its
responsibilities, including the authority to retain independent counsel and
other advisers, experts or consultants, at the funds' expense, as it
determines necessary to carry out its duties.  The Committee shall have direct
access to such officers of and service providers to the funds as it deems
desirable.

K. Review.  The Committee shall review this charter at least annually and
shall recommend such changes to the Administration Committee or the full Board
as it deems desirable.


EXHIBIT A

Policy for Raising and Investigating Complaints or Concerns

About Accounting or Auditing Matters

As contemplated by the Audit Committee Charter, the Committee has established
the following procedures for:

the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by a fund
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters; and

the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the John Hancock
Advisers, LLC or its affiliates of concerns regarding questionable accounting
or auditing matters.

A. Policy Objectives

The objective of this policy is to provide a mechanism by which complaints and
concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters may be raised and addressed without the fear or threat of retaliation.
 The funds desire and expects that the employees and officers of John Hancock
Advisers, LLC or any other service provider to the funds will report any
complaints or concerns they may have regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters.

B. Procedures for Raising Complaints and Concerns

Persons with complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters or concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters may submit such complaints or concerns to the attention of funds'
Secretary by sending a letter or other writing to the funds' principal
executive offices.  Complaints and concerns may be made anonymously to any of
the above individuals.  In addition any complaints or concerns may also be
communicated anonymously, directly to any member of the Audit Committee.

C. Procedures for Investigating and Resolving Complaints and Concerns

All complaints and concerns received will be promptly forwarded to the Audit
Committee of the Board of Trustees or the chair of the Audit Committee, unless
they are determined to be without merit by Secretary of the funds.  If sent
only to the chair, the chair may determine the appropriate response or may
refer the issues to the entire Audit Committee.  In any event, the funds'
Secretary will provide a record of all complaints and concerns received
(whether or not determined to have merit) to the Audit Committee each fiscal
quarter.

The Audit Committee will evaluate any complaints or concerns received
(including those reported to the committee on a quarterly basis and which the
funds' Secretary has previously determined to be without merit).  If the Audit
Committee requires additional information to evaluate any complaint or
concern, it may conduct an investigation, including interviews of persons
believed to have relevant information.  The Audit Committee may, in its
discretion, assume responsibility for directing or conducting any
investigation or may delegate such responsibility to another person or entity.

After its evaluation of the complaint or concern, the Audit Committee will
authorize such follow-up actions, if any, as deemed necessary and appropriate
to address the substance of the complaint or concern.  The funds reserves the
right to take whatever action the Audit Committee believes appropriate, up to
an including discharge of any employee deemed to have engaged in improper
conduct.

Regardless of whether a complaint or concern is submitted anonymously, the
Audit Committee will strive to keep all complaints and concerns and the
identity of those who submit them and participate in any investigation as
confidential as possible, limiting disclosure to those with a business need to
know.

John Hancock Advisers, LLC and its affiliates shall not penalize or retaliate
against any person or entity for reporting a complaint or concern, unless it
is determined that the complaint or concern was made with knowledge that it
was false.  The funds will not tolerate retaliation against any person or
entity for submitting, or for cooperating in the investigation of, a complaint
or concern.  Moreover, any such retaliation is unlawful and may result in
criminal action.  Any retaliation will warrant disciplinary action against the
offending party, up to and including termination of employment.

John Hancock Advisers, LLC and its subadvisers shall include this policy in
its employee manual and shall distribute, at least annually, the policy to all
of its employees.

The funds shall retain records of all complaints and concerns received, and
the disposition thereof, for five years.


EXHIBIT B-QLCC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The QLCC shall adopt written procedures for the confidential receipt,
retention, and consideration of any report of evidence of a material
violation.

The QLCC has the authority and responsibility, once a report of evidence of a
material violation by a Fund, its officers, directors, employees or agents has
been received by the QLCC:

(i) to inform the CLO and CEO of such report (except in the case where the
reporting attorney reasonably believes that it would be futile to report
evidence of a material violation to the CLO and CEO, and has informed the QLCC
of such belief); and

(ii) to determine whether an investigation is necessary or appropriate, and,
if it determines an investigation is necessary or appropriate, to:

(A) notify the full board of directors;

(B) initiate an investigation, which may be conducted either by the CLO or by
outside attorneys; and

(C) retain such additional expert personnel as the QLCC deems necessary;

and, at the conclusion of such investigation, to:

(A) recommend, by majority vote, that the Fund implement an appropriate
response to evidence of a material violation; and

(B) inform the CLO and the CEO and the Board of Trustees of the results of any
such investigation and the appropriate remedial measures.

(iii) by majority vote, to take all other appropriate action, including
notifying the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the event that the
Fund fails in any material respect to implement an appropriate response that
the QLCC has recommended.

JOHN HANCOCK FUNDS

ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE CHARTER

A.  Composition.  The Administration Committee shall be composed of all
Trustees who are both "independent" as defined in the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange and are not "interested persons" as defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940 of John Hancock Adviser LLC or of the Trust (the
"Independent Trustees").

B.  Overview.  The overall charter of the Administration Committee is:  (i) to
review and comment on complex-wide matters to facilitate uniformity among the

H.  Review.  The Committee shall review this Charter periodically and
recommend such changes to the full Board as it deems desirable.


ANNEX A

General Criteria

1.  Nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to
high ethical standards.

2.  Nominees should have demonstrated business acumen, experience and ability
to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and
long-term objectives of the Fund(s) and should be willing and able to
contribute positively to the decision-making process of the Fund(s).

3.  Nominees should have a commitment to understand the Fund(s), and the
responsibilities of a Trustee/Director of an investment company and to
regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees.

4.  Nominees should have the ability to understand the sometimes conflicting
interests of the various constituencies of the Fund, including shareholders
and the management company, and to act in the interests of all shareholders.

5.  Nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that
would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all the
shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director /trustee.

6.  Nominees shall not be discriminated against on the basis of race,
religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other
basis proscribed by law.  The value of diversity on the Board should be
considered.

Application of Criteria to Existing

The renomination of existing Trustees should not be viewed as automatic, but
should be based on continuing qualification under the criteria set forth
above.  In addition, the Administrative Committee shall consider the existing
trustees' performance on the Board and any committee.

Review of Shareholder Nominations

Any shareholder recommendation must be submitted in compliance with all of the
pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
to be considered by the Administration Committee.  In evaluating a nominee
recommended by a shareholder, the Administration Committee, in addition to the
criteria discussed above, may consider the objectives of the shareholder in
submitting that nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the
interests of all shareholders. If the Board determines to include a
shareholder's candidate among the slate of nominees, the candidate's name will
be placed on the Fund's proxy card.  If the Administration Committee or the
Board determines not to include such candidate among the Board's designated
nominees and the shareholder has satisfied the requirements of Rule 14a-8, the
shareholder's candidate will be treated as a nominee of the shareholder who
originally nominated the candidate.  In that case, the candidate will not be
named on the proxy card distributed with the Fund's proxy statement.

As long as an existing Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of the
Administration Committee, to satisfy the criteria listed above, the Committee
generally would favor the re-nomination of an existing Trustee rather than a
new candidate.  Consequently, while the Administration Committee will consider
nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as trustees, the Administration
Committee may only act upon such recommendations if there is a vacancy on the
Board or the Administration Committee determines that the selection of a new
or additional Independent Trustee is in the best interests of the Fund.  In
the event that a vacancy arises or a change in Board membership is determined
to be advisable, the Administration Committee will, in addition to any
shareholder recommendations, consider candidates identified by other means,
including candidates proposed by members of the Administration Committee.
While it has not done so in the past, the Administration Committee may retain
a consultant to assist the Committee in a search for a qualified candidate

Communications from shareholders

Shareholders may communicate with the members of the Board as a group or
individually.  Any such communication should be sent to the Board or an
individual Trustee c/o the secretary of the Fund at the address on the notice
of this meeting.  The Secretary may determine not to forward any letter to the
members of the Board that does not relate to the business of the Fund.

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES
<TEXT>

John Hancock Advisers, LLC
Sovereign Asset Management Corporation
Proxy Voting Guidelines

We believe in placing our clients' interests first. Before we invest in a
particular stock or bond, our team of portfolio managers and research analysts
look closely at the company by examining its earnings history, its management
team and its place in the market. Once we invest, we monitor all our clients'
holdings, to ensure that they maintain their potential to produce results for
investors.

As part of our active investment management strategy, we keep a close eye on
each company we invest in. Routinely, companies issue proxies by which they ask
investors like us to vote for or against a change, such as a new management
team, a new business procedure or an acquisition. We base our decisions on how
to vote these proxies with the goal of maximizing the value of our clients'
investments.

Currently, John Hancock Advisers, LLC ("JHA") and Sovereign Asset Management
Corporation ("Sovereign") manage open-end funds, closed-end funds and portfolios
for institutions and high-net-worth investors. Occasionally, we utilize the
expertise of an outside asset manager by means of a subadvisory agreement. In
all cases, JHA or Sovereign makes the final decision as to how to vote our
clients' proxies. There is one exception, however, and that pertains to our
international  accounts. The investment management team for international
investments votes the proxies for the accounts they manage. Unless voting is
specifically retained by the named fiduciary of the client, JHA and Sovereign
will vote proxies for ERISA clients.

In order to ensure a consistent, balanced approach across all our investment
teams, we have established a proxy oversight group comprised of associates from
our investment, operations and legal teams. The group has developed a set of
policies and procedures that detail the standards for how JHA and Sovereign vote
proxies. The guidelines of JHA have been approved and adopted by each fund
client's board of trustees who have voted to delegate proxy voting authority to
their investment adviser, JHA. JHA and Sovereign's other clients have granted us
the authority to vote proxies in our advisory contracts or comparable documents.

JHA and Sovereign have hired a third party proxy voting service which has been
instructed to vote all proxies in accordance with our established guidelines
except as otherwise instructed.

In evaluating proxy issues, our proxy oversight group may consider information
from many sources, including the portfolio manager, management of a company
presenting a proposal, shareholder groups, and independent proxy research
services. Proxies for securities on loan through securities lending programs
will generally not be voted, however a decision may be made to recall a security
for voting purposes if the issue is material.

Below are the guidelines we adhere to when voting proxies. Please keep in mind
that these are purely guidelines. Our actual votes will be driven by the
particular circumstances of each proxy. From time to time votes may ultimately
be cast on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. Decisions on these matters (case-by-case,
abstention, recall) will normally be made by a portfolio manager under the
supervision of the chief investment officer and the proxy oversight group. We
may abstain from voting a proxy if we conclude that the effect on our clients'
economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or
insignificant.

Proxy Voting Guidelines

Board of Directors

We believe good corporate governance evolves from an independent board.

We support the election of uncontested director nominees, but will withhold our
vote for any nominee attending less than 75% of the board and committee meetings
during the previous fiscal year. Contested elections will be considered on a
case by case basis by the proxy oversight group, taking into account the
nominee's qualifications. We will support management's ability to set the size
of the board of directors and to fill vacancies without shareholder approval but
will not support a board that has fewer than 3 directors or allows for the
removal of a director without cause.

We will support declassification of a board and block efforts to adopt a
classified board structure. This structure typically divides the board into
classes with each class serving a staggered term.

In addition, we support proposals for board indemnification and limitation of
director liability, as long as they are consistent with corporate law and
shareholders' interests. We believe that this is necessary to attract qualified
board members.

Selection of Auditors

We believe an independent audit committee can best determine an auditor's
qualifications.

We will vote for management proposals to ratify the board's selection of
auditors, and for proposals to increase the independence of audit committees.

Capitalization

We will vote for a proposal to increase or decrease authorized common or
preferred stock and the issuance of common stock, but will vote against a
proposal to issue or convert preferred or multiple classes of stock if the board
has unlimited rights to set the terms and conditions of the shares, or if the
shares have voting rights inferior or superior to those of other shareholders.

In addition, we will support a management proposal to: create or restore
preemptive rights; approve a stock repurchase program; approve a stock split or
reverse stock split; and, approve the issuance or exercise of stock warrants

Acquisitions, mergers and corporate restructuring

Proposals to merge with or acquire another company will be voted on a
case-by-case basis, as will proposals for recapitalization, restructuring,
leveraged buyout, sale of assets, bankruptcy or liquidation. We will vote
against a reincorporation proposal if it would reduce shareholder rights. We
will vote against a management proposal to ratify or adopt a poison pill or to
establish a supermajority voting provision to approve a merger or other business
combination. We would however support a management proposal to opt out of a
state takeover statutory provision, to spin-off certain operations or divisions
and to establish a fair price provision.

Corporate Structure and Shareholder Rights

In general, we support proposals that foster good corporate governance
procedures and that provide shareholders with voting power equal to their equity
interest in the company.

To preserve shareholder rights, we will vote against a management proposal to
restrict shareholders' right to: call a special meeting and to eliminate a
shareholders' right to act by written consent. In addition, we will not support
a management proposal to adopt a supermajority vote requirement to change
certain by-law or charter provisions or a non-technical amendment to by-laws or
a charter that reduces shareholder rights.

Equity-based compensation

Equity-based compensation is designed to attract, retain and motivate talented
executives and independent directors, but should not be so significant as to
materially dilute shareholders' interests.

We will vote against the adoption or amendment of a stock option plan if the: *
plan dilution is more than 10% of outstanding common stock,
* plan allows for non-qualified options to be priced at less than 85% of the
fair market value on the grant date,
* company allows or has allowed the re-pricing or replacement of underwater
options in the past fiscal year (or the exchange of underwater options).

With respect to the adoption or amendment of employee stock purchase plans or a
stock award plan, we will vote against management if: * the plan allows stock to
be purchased at less than 85% of fair market value; * this plan dilutes
outstanding common equity greater than 10% * all stock purchase plans, including
the proposed plan, exceed 15% of outstanding common equity.

Other Business

For routine business matters which are the subject of many proxy related
questions, we will vote with management proposals to: * change the company name;
* approve other business; * adjourn meetings; * make technical amendments to the
by-laws or charters; * approve financial statements; * approve an employment
agreement or contract.

Shareholder Proposals

Shareholders are permitted per SEC regulations to submit proposals for inclusion
in a company's proxy statement. We will generally vote against shareholder
proposals and in accordance with the recommendation of management except as
follows where we will vote for proposals: * calling for shareholder ratification
of auditors; * calling for auditors to attend annual meetings; * seeking to
increase board independence; * requiring minimum stock ownership by directors; *
seeking to create a nominating committee or to increase the independence of the
nominating committee; * seeking to increase the independence of the audit
committee.

Corporate and social policy issues

We believe that "ordinary business matters" are primarily the responsibility of
management and should be approved solely by the corporation's board of
directors.

Proposals in this category, initiated primarily by shareholders, typically
request that the company disclose or amend certain business practices. We
generally vote against business practice proposals and abstain on social policy
issues, though we may make exceptions in certain instances where we believe a
proposal has substantial economic implications.

Proxy Voting Procedures

The role of the proxy voting service
John Hancock Advisers, LLC ("JHA") and Sovereign Asset Management Corporation
("Sovereign") have hired a proxy voting service to assist with the voting of
client proxies. The proxy service coordinates with client custodians to ensure
that proxies are received for securities held in client accounts and acted on in
a timely manner. The proxy service votes all proxies received in accordance with
the proxy voting guidelines established and adopted by JHA and Sovereign. When
it is unclear how to apply a particular proxy voting guideline or when a
particular proposal is not covered by the guidelines, the proxy voting service
will contact the proxy oversight group coordinator for a resolution.

The role of the proxy oversight group and coordinator
The coordinator will interact directly with the proxy voting service to resolve
any issues the proxy voting service brings to the attention of JHA or Sovereign.
When a question arises regarding how a proxy should be voted the coordinator
contacts the firm's investment professionals and the proxy oversight group for a
resolution. In addition the coordinator ensures that the proxy voting service
receives responses in a timely manner. Also, the coordinator is responsible for
identifying whether, when a voting issue arises, there is a potential conflict
of interest situation and then escalating the issue to the firm's Executive
Committee. For securities out on loan as part of a securities lending program,
if a decision is made to vote a proxy, the coordinator will manage the
return/recall of the securities so the proxy can be voted.

The role of mutual fund trustees
The boards of trustees of our mutual fund clients have reviewed and adopted the
proxy voting guidelines of the funds' investment adviser, JHA. The trustees will
periodically review the proxy voting guidelines and suggest changes they deem
advisable.

Conflicts of interest

Conflicts of interest are resolved in the best interest of clients.

With respect to potential conflicts of interest, proxies will be voted in
accordance with JHA's or Sovereign's predetermined policies. If application of
the predetermined policy is unclear or does not address a particular proposal, a
special internal review by the JHA Executive Committee or Sovereign Executive
Committee will determine the vote. After voting, a report will be made to the
client (in the case of an investment company, to the fund's board of trustees),
if requested. An example of a conflict of interest created with respect to a
proxy solicitation is when JHA or Sovereign must vote the proxies of companies
that they provide investment advice to or are currently seeking to provide
investment advice to, such as to pension plans.
