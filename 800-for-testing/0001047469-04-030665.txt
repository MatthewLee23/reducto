(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the value at the end of
the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing
the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income dividends
have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment
plan. Total return does not reflect broker commissions or sales charges. Total
return for a period of less than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at July 31, 2004.

PIMCO FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
July 31, 2004

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Floating Rate Income Fund (the "Fund") was organized as a Massachusetts
business trust on June 19, 2003. Prior to commencing operations on August 29,
2003, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its organization
and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 5,168 shares of
beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,001 to Allianz
Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PA Fund Management LLC (the
"Investment Manager") serves as the Fund's Investment Manager and is an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect, majority-owned
subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value
common stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to seek high current income, consistent with
the preservation of capital by investing primarily in floating rate debt
instruments, a substantial portion of which will be senior floating rate loans.
The ability of the issuers of the Fund's investments to meet their obligations
may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry.

The Fund issued 16,250,000 shares of common stock, in its initial public
offering. An additional 1,500,000 shares were issued in connection with the
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. These shares were all
issued at $20.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.65 per share.
Common offering costs of $710,000 (representing $0.04 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment Manager agreed to pay all offering costs (other
than the sales load) and organizational expenses exceeding $0.04 per share.
Because aggregate offering costs and organizational expenses exceeded $0.04 per
common share, all organizational expenses and offering costs in excess of $0.04
per common share were reimbursed by the Investment Manager. In addition, the
underwriters' commission and offering costs associated with the issuance of
Preferred Shares in the amounts of $2,100,000 and $483,503, respectively, have
been charged to paid-in capital in excess of par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily available are stated at market value. The Fund's investments in
senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans") are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Trustees. Under the Fund's guidelines,
Senior Loans for which a secondary market exists will be valued at the mean of
the last available bid and asked prices in the market for such Senior Loans, as
provided by a Board-approved independent pricing service. Other Senior Loans are
valued at fair value by the Fund's Sub-Adviser, pursuant to procedures approved
by the Board of Trustees. Such procedures include consideration and evaluation
of: (1) the creditworthiness of the borrower and any intermediate participants;
(2) the term of the Senior Loan; (3) recent prices in the market for similar
loans, if any; (4) recent prices in the market for loans of similar quality,
coupon rate, and period until next interest rate reset and maturity, and (5)
general economic and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior
Loan. Other portfolio securities and financial instruments are valued by an
independent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees, dealer
quotations, or are valued at the last sale price on the exchange that is the
primary market for such securities, or the last quoted bid price for those
securities for which the over-the-counter market is the primary market or for
listed securities in which there were no sales. The independent pricing service
uses information provided by market makers or estimates of market values
obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar
characteristics. Short-term investments maturing in 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, if their original maturity was 60 days or less, or by
amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if the original term
to maturity exceeded 60 days. Securities for which market quotations are not
readily available or if a development/significant event occurs that
significantly impact the value of the security, may be fair valued pursuant to
guidelines established by the Board of Trustees. The prices used by the Fund to
value securities may differ from the value that would be realized if the
securities were sold. The Fund's net asset value is

                                       17
<Page>

determined weekly on the last business day of the week at the close of regular
trading (normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the lives of the
respective securities using the effective interest method. Facility fees and
other fees (such as origination fees) received by the Fund are amortized as
income over the expected term of the loan. Commitment fees received by the Fund
relating to unfunded purchase commitments are deferred and amortized to facility
fee income over the period of the commitment.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the
other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of its ordinary income and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar
year the Fund intends not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Fund declares dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net
investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either considered
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current
and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(e) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1) the foreign
currency market value of investments and other assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are translated at the prevailing exchange rate
at the end of the period; and (2) purchases and sales, income and expenses are
translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the respective dates of such
transactions. The resulting net foreign currency gain or loss is included in the
Statement of Operations.

The Fund does not generally isolate that portion of the results of operations
arising as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates from the
fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of securities.
Accordingly, such foreign currency gain (loss) is included in net realized and
unrealized gain (loss) on investments. However, the Fund does isolate the effect
of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when determining the gain or
loss upon the sale or maturity of foreign currency denominated debt obligations
pursuant to U.S. federal income tax regulations; such amount is categorized as
foreign currency gain or loss for both financial reporting and income tax
reporting purposes.

(f) SENIOR LOANS
The Fund purchases assignments of Senior Loans originated, negotiated and
structured by a U.S. or foreign commercial bank, insurance company, finance
company or other financial institution (the "Agent") for a lending syndicate of
financial institutions "Lenders"). When purchasing an assignment, the Fund
succeeds all the rights and obligations under the loan agreement with the same
rights and obligations as the assigning Lender. Assignments may, however, be
arranged through private negotiations between potential assignees and potential
assignors, and the rights and obligations acquired by the purchaser of an
assignment may differ from, and be more limited than, those held by the
assigning Lender.

(g) INTEREST RATE/CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
The Fund enters into interest rate and credit default swap contracts ("swaps")
for investment purposes, to manage its interest rate and credit risk or to add
leverage.

As a seller in a credit default swap contract, the Fund would be required to pay
the notional or other agreed-upon value to the counterparty in the event of a
default by a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer, on the
referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund would receive from the
counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract
provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default occurs, the Fund
would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment obligations.

                                       18
<Page>

The Fund may also purchase credit default swap contracts in order to hedge
against the risk of default of debt securities held, in which case the Fund
would function as the counterparty referenced in the preceding paragraph. As a
purchaser of a credit default swap contract, the Fund would receive the notional
or other agreed upon value from the counterparty in the event of default by a
third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer on the referenced debt
obligation. In return, the Fund would make periodic payments to the counterparty
over the term of the contract provided no event of default has occurred. Such
periodic payments are accrued daily and charged to realized gains/(loss).

Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange by the Fund with a
counterparty of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g.,
an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a
notional amount of principal. Net periodic payments received by the Fund are
included as part of net realized gain/(loss) on the Statement of Operations.

Swaps are marked to market daily by the Fund's Investment Manager based upon
quotations from market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Fund's Statement of Operations.
For a credit default swap sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount
made by the Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt obligation is
recorded as the cost of the referenced debt obligation purchased/received. For a
credit default swap purchased by the Fund, the agreed upon amount received by
the Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded
as proceeds from sale/delivery of the referenced debt obligation and the
resulting gain or loss realized on the referenced debt obligation is recorded as
such by the Fund.

Entering into swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and
documentation risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no
liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may
default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the
contractual terms in the agreements, and that there may be unfavorable changes
in net interest rates.

(h) FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS
The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for the purpose of
hedging against foreign currency risk arising from the investment or anticipated
investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund may also
enter into these contracts for purposes of increasing exposure to a foreign
currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country
to another. A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two
parties to buy and sell a currency at a set exchange rate on a future date. The
market value of a forward foreign currency contract fluctuates with changes in
forward currency exchange rates. All commitments are marked to market daily at
the applicable exchange rates and any resulting unrealized gains and losses are
recorded. Realized gains or losses are recorded at the time the forward contract
matures or by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering these
contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign
currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

(i) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
The Fund may purchase and write (sell) put and call options for hedging and/or
risk management purposes. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that
the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally,
the Fund bears the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities
acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by the premiums paid.
The proceeds from the securities sold through the exercise of put options is
decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an written
option could result in the Fund purchasing a security at a price different from
the current market price.

                                       19

(j) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Fund is required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Fund as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value at the
time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded is
simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves the risk of an
imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets and the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(k) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund may enter into transactions with its custodian bank or securities
brokerage firms approved by the Board of Trustees whereby it purchases
securities under agreements to resell at an agreed upon price and date
("repurchase agreements"). Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in
the financial statements. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which
consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset backed securities,
are held by the custodian bank until maturity of the repurchase agreement.
Provisions of the repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Fund
require that the market value of the collateral, including accrued interest
thereon, is sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the
counterparty defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if the
counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by
the Fund may be delayed or limited.

(l) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES
Credit-linked trust certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other vehicle formed under state law which, in turn, invests in a basket of
derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and
other securities, in order to provide exposure to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Like an investment in a bond, investments in these credit-linked trust
certificates represent the right to receive periodic income payments (in the
form of distributions) and payment of principal at the end of the term of the
certificate. However, these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential obligations to, the counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(m) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES
The Fund benefits from an expense offset arrangement with its custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce custodian and
accounting agent fees. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing
securities, they would have generated income for the Fund.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as the Fund's Investment Manager. Subject
to the supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees, the Investment Manager is
responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's business affairs and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investment Manager will
receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's
average weekly total managed assets. Total managed assets refer to the total
assets of the Fund (including assets attributable to any Preferred Shares or
other forms of leverage that may be outstanding minus accrued liabilities (other
than liabilities representing leverage). The Investment Manager has retained its
affiliate, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser") to
manage the Fund's investments. Subject to the supervision of the Investment
Manager, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for making all investment decisions. The
Investment Manager (not the Fund) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the
Sub-Adviser in return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.39% of
the Fund's average weekly total managed assets for the period from commencement
of operations through August 31, 2008. Commencing September 1, 2008, the
Investment Manager will pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee at the annual rate of
0.55% of the Fund's average weekly total managed assets. The Investment Manager
informed the Fund that it paid the Sub-Adviser $1,827,342 in connection with its
sub-advisory services for the period ended July 31, 2004.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

6. SUBSEQUENT COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS
On August 6, 2004, a dividend of $0.08560 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable September 3, 2004 to shareholders of record on August 20,
2004.

On September 3, 2004, a dividend of $0.8752 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable October 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on September 17,
2004.

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On June 1, 2004, the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey announced that
it had entered into a settlement agreement with ADAM and certain other
affiliates of the Investment Manager, in connection with a complaint filed by
the New Jersey Attorney General ("NJAG"). The NJAG dismissed its claims against
the Sub-Adviser, which had been filed as part of the same complaint. In the
settlement, ADAM and other named affiliates neither admitted nor denied the
allegations or conclusions of law, but did agree to pay New Jersey a civil fine
of $15 million and $3 million for investigative costs and further potential
enforcement initiatives against unrelated parties. They also undertook to
implement certain governance changes. The complaint relating to the settlement
alleged, among other things, that ADAM and the other affiliates had failed to
disclose that they improperly allowed certain hedge funds to engage in "market
timing" in various open-end investment companies ("open-end funds") advised or
distributed by the Investment Manager and certain of its affiliates. The
complaint sought injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, restitution and
disgorgement of profits.

On September 13, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
announced that the Investment Manager and certain of its affiliates had agreed
to a settlement of charges that they and certain of their officers had, among
other things, violated various antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws in connection with an alleged market-timing arrangement involving trading
of shares of various open-end funds advised and/or distributed by the Investment
Manager and its affiliates. In the settlement, the Investment Manager and their
affiliates consented to the entry of an order by the Commission and, without
admitting or denying the findings contained in the order, agreed to implement
certain compliance and governance changes and consented to cease-and-desist
orders and censures. In addition, the Investment Manager and its affiliates
agreed to pay civil money penalties aggregating $40 million and to pay jointly
disgorgement in the amount of $10 million, for an aggregate payment of $50
million. In connection with the settlement, the Commission has indicated that it
will seek to dismiss the Investment Manager and its affiliates from the related
complaint it filed on May 6, 2004 in the U.S. District Court in the Southern
District of New York. Neither the complaint nor the order alleges any
inappropriate activity took place with respect to the Fund.

On September 15, 2004, the Commission announced that the Investment Manager and
certain of its affiliates agreed to settle an enforcement action in connection
with charges that they violated various antifraud and other provisions of
federal securities laws as a result of, among other things, their failure to
disclose to the board of trustees and shareholders of various open-end funds
advised or distributed by the Investment Manager and its affiliates material

                                       23

facts and conflicts of interest that arose from their use of brokerage
commissions on portfolio transactions to pay for so-called "shelf space"
arrangements with certain broker-dealers. In the settlement, the Investment
Manager and its affiliates consented to the entry of an order by the Commission
without admitting or denying the findings contained in the order. In connection
with the settlement, the Investment Manager and its affiliates agreed to
undertake certain compliance and disclosure reforms and consented to
cease-and-desist orders and censures. In addition, the Investment Manager and
one of its affiliates agreed to jointly pay a civil monetary penalty of $4
million another affiliate agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1 million
and the Investment Manager and its affiliates agreed to jointly pay disgorgement
of $6.6 million based upon the amount of brokerage commissions alleged to have
been paid by such open-end funds in connection with these arrangements (and
related interest). In a related action, the California Attorney General
announced on September 15, 2004 that it had entered an agreement with an
affiliate of the Investment Manager in resolution of an investigation into
matters that are similar to those discussed in the Commission's order. The
settlement agreement resolves matters described in the compliant filed by the
California Attorney General in the Superior Court of the State of California
alleging, among other things, that this affiliate violated certain antifraud
provisions of California law by failing to disclose matters related to the
shelf-space arrangements described above. In the settlement agreement, the
affiliate did not admit to any liability but agreed to pay $5 million in civil
penalties and $4 million in recognition of the California Attorney General's
fees and costs associated with the investigation and related matters. Neither
the Commission's order nor the California Attorney General's complaint alleges
any inappropriate activity took place with respect to the Fund.

Since February 2004, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and certain of
their affiliates have been named as defendants in 14 lawsuits filed in U.S.
District Court in the Southern District of New York, the Central District of
California and the Districts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Ten of those
lawsuits concern "market timing," and they have been transferred to and
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland; four of those lawsuits concern "revenue sharing" with
brokers offering "shelf space" and have been consolidated into a single action
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The lawsuits have
been commenced as putative class actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed shares of affiliated funds during specified periods or as
derivative actions on behalf of the funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the
same facts that are the subject of the regulatory proceedings discussed above.
The lawsuits seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages plus
interest and, in some cases, punitive damages, the rescission of investment
advisory contracts, the return of fees paid under those contracts and
restitution. The Fund has been named in three of the lawsuits concerning market
timing. The Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that other similar
lawsuits may be filed in U.S. federal or state courts naming as defendants the
Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, ADAM, the Fund, other open- and closed-end
funds advised or distributed by the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and/or
their affiliates, the boards of trustees of those funds, and/or other affiliates
as defendants.

Under Section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, if any of the various
regulatory proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, ADAM and/or their affiliates, they and
their affiliates would, in the absence of exemptive relief granted by the
Commission, be barred from serving as an investment adviser/sub-adviser or
principal underwriter for any registered investment company, including the Fund.
In connection with an inquiry from the Commission concerning the status of the
New Jersey settlement described above under Section 9(a), the Investment
Manager, the Sub-Adviser, and certain of their affiliates (together, the
"Applicants") have sought exemptive relief from the Commission under Section
9(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Commission has granted the
Applicants a temporary exemption from the provisions of Section 9(a) with
respect to the New Jersey settlement until the earlier of (i) September 13, 2006
and (ii) the date on which the Commission takes final action on their
application for a permanent order. There is no assurance that the Commission
will issue a permanent order.

It is possible that these matters and/or other developments resulting from these
matters could lead to a decrease in the market price of the Fund's shares or
other adverse consequences to the Fund and its shareholders. However, the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Fund or on the Investment Manager's or
the Sub-Adviser's ability to perform its respective investment advisory services
relating to the Fund.

8. CHAIRMAN RESIGNATION
On July 29, 2004, Stephen Treadway resigned as the Fund's Chairman.

PIMCO FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF
PIMCO FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, changes
in net assets applicable to common shareholders and cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
PIMCO Floating Rate Income Fund (the "Fund") at July 31, 2004, and the results
of its operations, the changes in its net assets applicable to common
shareholders, cash flows and the financial highlights for the period August 29,
2003 (commencement of operations) through July 31, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit, which included confirmation of securities at July 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian, brokers and agent banks, provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

PIMCO FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all Common
Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
dividends, including any capital gain dividends, reinvested automatically in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders (the
"Plan Agent"), unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. An election to
receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the shareholder. In
the case of record shareholders such as banks, brokers or other nominees that
hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares certified from
time to time by the record shareholder as representing the total amount
registered in such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in
the name of a bank, broker or nominee should contact the bank, broker or nominee
for details. All distributions to investors who elect not to participate in the
Plan (or whose broker or nominee elects not to participate on the investor's
behalf), will be paid cash by check mailed, in the case of direct shareholder,
to the record holder by PFPC Inc., as the Fund's dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee) elects not to participate in the Plan,
the number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1) If common Shares are trading at or above net asset value on the payment
    date, the Fund will issue new shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
    value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market price
    per Common Share on the payment date; or

(2) If Common Shares are trading below net asset value (minus estimated
    brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of Common
    Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the Plan Agent will receive
    the dividend or distribution in cash and will purchase Common Shares in the
    open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
    participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for the Common
    Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases.
    Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the Plan Agent may
    exceed the market price on the payment date, resulting in the purchase of
    fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common
    Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
    distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market
    on or shortly after the payment date, but in no event later than the
    ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest will not be paid on any
    uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a certificate for
each whole share in your account under the Plan and you will receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan Agent
will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common Shares with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive distributions in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvested dividends and distributions are taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund
reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the
participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from the
Fund's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027,
telephone number 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

     a)   Audit fees. The aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal
          years (the "Reporting Periods") for professional services rendered by
          the Registrant's principal accountant (the "Auditor")for the audit of
          the Registrant's annual financial statements, or services that are
          normally provided by the Auditor in connection with the statutory and
          regulatory filings or engagements for the Reporting Periods, was
          $91,000 in 2004.

     b)   Audit-Related Fees. The aggregate fees billed in the Reporting Periods
          for assurance and related services by the principal accountant that
          are reasonably related to the performance of the audit registrant's
          financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (e) of this
          Item was $33,000 in 2004. These services consist of accounting
          consultations, agreed upon procedure reports (inclusive of annual
          review of basic maintenance testing associated with the Preferred
          Shares), attestation reports and comfort letters.

<Page>

     c)   Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed in the Reporting Periods for
          professional services rendered by the Auditor for tax compliance, tax
          service and tax planning ("Tax Services") was $3,000 in 2004. These
          services consisted of review or preparation of U.S. federal, state,
          local and excise tax returns.

     d)   All Other Fees. There were no other fees billed in the Reporting
          Periods for products and services provided by the Auditor to the
          Registrant.

     e)    1. Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. The
          Registrant's Audit Committee has established policies and procedures
          for pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services by
          the Auditor for the Registrant, as well as the Auditor's engagements
          for non-audit services to the when the engagement relates directly to
          the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant. The
          Registrant's policy is stated below.

          PIMCO Floating Rate Income Fund (THE "FUND")

AUDIT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE POLICY FOR PRE-APPROVAL OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE
INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

The Funds' Audit Oversight Committee ("Committee") is charged with the oversight
of the Funds' financial reporting policies and practices and their internal
controls. As part of this responsibility, the Committee must pre-approve any
independent accounting firm's engagement to render audit and/or permissible
non-audit services, as required by law. In evaluating a proposed engagement by
the independent accountants, the Committee will assess the effect that the
engagement might reasonably be expected to have on the accountant's
independence. The Committee's evaluation will be based on:

  a review of the nature of the professional services expected to provided,

  the fees to be charged in connection with the services expected to be
  provided,

  a review of the safeguards put into place by the accounting firm to
  safeguard independence, and

  periodic meetings with the accounting firm.

POLICY FOR AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FUNDS

On an annual basis, the Funds' Committee will review and pre-approve the scope
of the audits of the Funds and proposed audit fees and permitted non-audit

<Page>

(including audit-related) services that may be performed by the Funds'
independent accountants. At least annually, the Committee will receive a report
of all audit and non-audit services that were rendered in the previous calendar
year pursuant to this Policy. In addition to the Committee's pre-approval of
services pursuant to this Policy, the engagement of the independent accounting
firm for any permitted non-audit service provided to the Funds will also require
the separate written pre-approval of the President of the Funds, who will
confirm, independently, that the accounting firms's engagement will not
adversely affect the firm's independence. All non-audit services performed by
the independent accounting firm will be disclosed, as required, in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AUDIT SERVICES

The categories of audit services and related fees to be reviewed and
pre-approved annually by the Committee are:

  Annual Fund financial statement audits
  Seed audits (related to new product filings, as required)
  SEC and regulatory filings and consents
  Semiannual financial statement reviews

AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

The following categories of audit-related services are considered to be
consistent with the role of the Fund's independent accountants and services
falling under one of these categories will be pre-approved by the Committee on
an annual basis if the Committee deems those services to be consistent with the
accounting firm's independence:

  Accounting consultations
  Fund merger support services
  Agreed upon procedure reports (inclusive of quarterly review of Basic
   Maintenance testing associated with issuance of Preferred Shares and
   semiannual report review)
  Other attestation reports
  Comfort letters
  Other internal control reports

Individual audit-related services that fall within one of these categories and
are not presented to the Committee as part of the annual pre-approval process
described above, may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting
firm's independence, by the Committee Chair (or any other Committee member who
is a disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those
services does not exceed $75,000. Any such pre-approval shall be reported to the
full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

TAX SERVICES

<Page>

The following categories of tax services are considered to be consistent with
the role of the Funds' independent accountants and services falling under one of
these categories will be pre-approved by the Committee on an annual basis if the
Committee deems those services to be consistent with the accounting firm's
independence:

  Tax compliance services related to the filing or amendment of the following:
   Federal, state and local income tax compliance; and, sales and use tax
     compliance
   Timely RIC qualification reviews
   Tax distribution analysis and planning
   Tax authority examination services
   Tax appeals support services
   Accounting methods studies
   Fund merger support service
   Other tax consulting services and related projects

Individual tax services that fall within one of these categories and are not
presented to the Committee as part of the annual pre-approval process described
above, may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting firm's
independence, by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a
disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those
services does not exceed $75,000. Any such pre-approval shall be reported to the
full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

PROSCRIBED SERVICES

The Funds' independent accountants will not render services in the following
categories of non-audit services:

  Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial
   statements of the Funds
  Financial information systems design and implementation
  Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or
   contribution-in-kind reports
  Actuarial services
  Internal audit outsourcing services
  Management functions or human resources
  Broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services Legal
  services and expert services unrelated to the audit Any other service that the
  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
   determines, by regulation, is impermissible

PRE-APPROVAL OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES PROVIDED TO OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN THE FUND
COMPLEX

The Committee will pre-approve annually any permitted non-audit services to be
provided to PA Fund Management LLC (Formerly, PIMCO Advisors Fund Management

<Page>

LLC) or any other investment manager to the Funds (but not including any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted
by the investment manager) (the "Investment Manager") and any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Manager
that provides ongoing services to the Funds (including affiliated sub-advisers
to the Funds), provided, in each case, that the engagement relates directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Funds (such entities, including
the Investment Manager, shall be referred to herein as the "Accounting
Affiliates"). Individual projects that are not presented to the Committee as
part of the annual pre-approval process, may be pre-approved, if deemed
consistent with the accounting firm's independence, by the Committee Chairman
(or any other Committee member who is a disinterested trustee under the
Investment Company Act to whom this responsibility has been delegated) so long
as the estimated fee for those services does not exceed $100,000. Any such
pre-approval shall be reported to the full Committee at its next regularly
scheduled meeting.

Although the Committee will not pre-approve all services provided to the
Investment Manager and its affiliates, the Committee will receive an annual
report from the Funds' independent accounting firm showing the aggregate fees
for all services provided to the Investment Manager and its affiliates.

DE MINIMUS EXCEPTION TO REQUIREMENT OF PRE-APPROVAL OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES

With respect to the provision of permitted non-audit services to a Fund or
Accounting Affiliates, the pre-approval requirement is waived if:

     (1)  The aggregate amount of all such permitted non-audit services provided
          constitutes no more than (i) with respect to such services provided to
          the Fund, five percent (5%) of the total amount of revenues paid by
          the Fund to its independent accountant during the fiscal year in which
          the services are provided, and(ii) with respect to such services
          provided to Accounting Affiliates, five percent (5%)of the total
          amount of revenues paid to the Fund's independent accountant by the
          Fund and the Accounting Affiliates during the fiscal year in which the
          services are provided;

     (2)  Such services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the
          engagement for such services to be non-audit services; and

     (3)  Such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee
          and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Committee or
          by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a
          disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
          Committee Chairman or other delegate shall be reported to the full
          Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

          e)   2. No services were approved pursuant to the procedures contained
               in paragraph (C) (7) (i) (C) of Rule 2-01 of Registration S-X.
<Page>

          f)   Not applicable

          g)   Non-audit fees. The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the
               Auditor for services rendered to the Registrant, and rendered to
               the Adviser, for the 2004 Reporting Period was $36,500.

          h)   Auditor Independence. The Registrant's Audit Oversight Committee
               has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that
               were rendered to the Adviser which were not pre-approved is
               compatible with maintaining the Auditor's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANT Not applicable

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS Schedule of Investments is included as part of
the report to shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END

proxies relating to its voting securities to its sub-adviser, Pacific Investment
Management Co. (the "Sub-Adviser"). The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of

          CODE OF ETHICS PURSUANT TO SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY
            ACT OF 2002 FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS

                               SEPTEMBER 16, 2003

I.     COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

       This Code of Ethics (this "Code") pursuant to Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been adopted by the registered investment
companies (each a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") listed on Exhibit A and
applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers" each of whom is
identified in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

       -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships;

       -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by a Fund;

       -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

       -    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

       Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of
interest.

II.    COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ANY ACTUAL OR APPARENT CONFLICTS
       OF INTEREST

       OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
relevant Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the relevant Fund.

       Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the relevant Fund and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions

<Page>

and procedures in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including the regulations
thereunder, the "1940 Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (including
the regulations thereunder, the "Investment Advisers Act"). Indeed, conflicts of
interest are endemic for certain registered management investment companies and
those conflicts are both substantially and procedurally dealt with under the
1940 Act. For example, Covered Officers may not engage in certain transactions
with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of such Fund. The
compliance program of each Fund and the compliance programs of its investment
advisers (including sub-advisers), principal underwriter and administrator or
sub-administrator (each a "Service Provider" and, collectively, the "Service
Providers") are reasonably designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of many of those provisions, although they are not designed to
provide absolute assurance as to those matters. This Code does not, and is not
intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts
fall outside of the parameters of this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

       Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Fund and its Service Providers of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether for the Funds or
for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Service Providers
and the Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationships between the Funds and their Service
Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the relevant Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, other
applicable law and the relevant Fund's constitutional documents, such activities
will be deemed to have been handled ethically. Frequently, the 1940 Act
establishes, as a mechanism for dealing with conflicts, disclosure to and
approval by the Directors/Trustees of a Fund who are not "interested persons" of
such Fund under the 1940 Act. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes and that such service, by itself, does not give rise to a conflict of
interest.

       Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not the subject of provisions of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should bear in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the relevant Fund, unless the personal interest has been disclosed
to and approved by other officers of such Fund or such Fund's Board or a
committee of such Fund's Board that has no such personal interest.

       Each Covered Officer must not:

       -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
            influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the
            relevant Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally
            to the detriment of such Fund;

       -    cause the relevant Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
            the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
            the benefit such Fund; or

       -    retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
            Funds or their Service Providers for reports of potential violations
            that are made in good faith.

       There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the President of the relevant Fund (or, with respect to activities
of the President, by the Chairman of the relevant Fund). These conflict of
interest situations are listed below:

       -    service on the board of directors or governing board of a publicly
            traded entity;

       -    acceptance of any investment opportunity or of any material gift or
            gratuity from any person or entity that does business, or desires to
            do business, with the relevant Fund. For these purposes, material
            gifts do not include (i) gifts from a single giver so long as their
            aggregate annual value does not exceed the equivalent of $100.00 or
            (ii) attending business meals, business related conferences,
            sporting events and other entertainment events at the expense of a
            giver, so long as the expense is reasonable and both the Covered
            Person and the giver are present.(1)

       -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any entities doing business with the relevant
            Fund, other than a Service Provider or an affiliate of a Service
            Provider. This restriction shall not apply to or otherwise limit the
            ownership of publicly traded securities so long as the Covered
            Person's ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the outstanding
            securities of the relevant class.

       -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by the relevant Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment with a
            Service Provider or its affiliate. This restriction shall not apply
            to or otherwise limit the ownership of

                                        3
<Page>

            publicly traded securities so long as the Covered Person's ownership
            does not exceed more than 2% of the particular class of security
            outstanding.

III.   DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

       -    no Covered Officer should knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
            misrepresent, facts about the relevant Fund to others, whether
            within or outside such Fund, including to such Fund's Board and
            auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
            organizations;

       -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
            area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
            the Funds and the Service Providers or with counsel to the Funds
            with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
            understandable disclosure in the registration statements or periodic
            reports that the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC (which, for
            sake of clarity, does not include any sales literature, omitting
            prospectuses, or "tombstone" advertising prepared by the relevant
            Fund's principal underwriter(s)); and

       -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
            laws, rules and regulations.

IV.    REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

       Each Covered Officer must:

       -    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
            becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the relevant Fund
            that he has received, read, and understands the Code;

       -    provide full and fair responses to all questions asked in any
            Trustee and Officer Questionnaire provided by the relevant Fund as
            well as with respect to any supplemental request for information;
            and

       -    notify the President of the relevant Fund promptly if he is
            convinced to a moral certainty that there has been a material
            violation of this Code (with respect to violations by a President,
            the Covered Officer shall report to the Chairman of the relevant
            Fund).

       The President of each Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by the President will be considered by the Chairman
of the relevant Fund.

       The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

                                        4
<Page>

       -    the President will take all appropriate action to investigate any
            potential material violations reported to him, which actions may
            include the use of internal or external counsel, accountants or
            other personnel;

       -    if, after such investigation, the President believes that no
            material violation has occurred, the President is not required to
            take any further action;

       -    any matter that the President believes is a material violation will
            be reported to the Committee;

       -    if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it
            will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
            consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
            appropriate modifications to applicable policies and procedures;
            notification to appropriate personnel of a Service Provider or its
            board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

       -    the Committee will be authorized to grant waivers, as it deems
            appropriate; and

       -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
            be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.     OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

       This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers govern or
purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are
subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their Service
Providers's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Service
Providers's more detailed compliance policies and procedures are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.

VI.    AMENDMENTS

       Any material amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board.

VII.   CONFIDENTIALITY

       All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone except as permitted by the Board.

VIII.  INTERNAL USE

       The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

                            FORM N-CSR CERTIFICATION

I, Brian S. Shlissel, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on the Form N-CSR of the PIMCO Floating Rate
     Income Fund;

2.   Based on my knowledge, the report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by the report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods in
     this report:

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

          (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
               disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
               supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
               known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
               the period in which this report is being prepared:

          (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
               caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
               designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
               regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
               preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
               accordance with generally accepted accounting principles:

          (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
               controls and procedures and presented in this report our
               conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
               and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
               date of this report based on such evaluation; and

          (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
               control over financial reporting that occurred during the
               registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's
               second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
               materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
               affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
               reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
               which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
               information; and

          (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
               internal controls over financial reporting.

                    PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

The following are general proxy voting policies and procedures ("Policies and
Procedures") adopted by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), an
investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended ("Advisers Act").(1) PIMCO serves as the investment adviser to a wide
range of domestic and international clients, including investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and
separate investment accounts for other clients.(2) These Policies and Procedures
are adopted to ensure compliance with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act,
other applicable fiduciary obligations of PIMCO and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and
interpretations of its staff. In addition to SEC requirements governing
advisers, PIMCO's Policies and Procedures reflect the long-standing fiduciary
standards and responsibilities applicable to investment advisers with respect to
accounts subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA"), as set forth in the Department of Labor's rules and regulations.(3)

PIMCO will implement these Policies and Procedures for each of its respective
clients as required under applicable law, unless expressly directed by a client
in writing to refrain from voting that client's proxies. PIMCO's authority to
vote proxies on behalf of its clients is established by its advisory contracts,
comparable documents or by an overall delegation of discretionary authority over
its client's assets. Recognizing that proxy voting is a rare event in the realm
of fixed income investing and is typically limited to solicitation of consent to
changes in features of debt securities, these Policies and Procedures also apply
to any voting rights and/or consent rights of PIMCO, on behalf of its clients,
with respect to debt securities, including but not limited to, plans of
reorganization, and waivers and consents under applicable indentures.(4)

- ----------
(1)  These Policies and Procedures are adopted by PIMCO pursuant to Rule
     206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act, effective August 6, 2003. SEE PROXY VOTING
     BY INVESTMENT ADVISERS, IA Release No. 2106 (January 31, 2003).

(2)  These Policies and Procedures address proxy voting considerations under
     U.S. law and regulations and do not address the laws or requirements of
     other jurisdictions.

(3)  Department of Labor Bulletin 94-2, 29 C.F.R. 2509.94-2 (July 29, 1994). If
     a client is subject to ERISA, PIMCO will be responsible for voting proxies

     retained the right and obligation to vote the proxies, and provided prior
     written notice to PIMCO of this retention.

(4)  For purposes of these Policies and Procedures, proxy voting includes any
     voting rights, consent rights or other voting authority of PIMCO on behalf
     of its clients.

<Page>

Set forth below are PIMCO's Policies and Procedures with respect to any voting
or consent rights of advisory clients over which PIMCO has discretionary voting
authority. These Policies and Procedures may be revised from time to time.

GENERAL STATEMENTS OF POLICY

These Policies and Procedures are designed and implemented in a manner
reasonably expected to ensure that voting and consent rights are exercised in
the best interests of PIMCO's clients. Each proxy is voted on a case-by-case
basis taking into consideration any relevant contractual obligations as well as
other relevant facts and circumstances.

PIMCO may abstain from voting a client proxy under the following circumstances:
(1) when the economic effect on shareholders' interests or the value of the
portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant; or (2) when the cost of
voting the proxies outweighs the benefits.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

PIMCO seeks to resolve any material conflicts of interest by voting in good
faith in the best interest of its clients. If a material conflict of interest
should arise, PIMCO will seek to resolve such conflict in the client's best
interest by pursuing any one of the following courses of action:

     1.   convening an ad-hoc committee to assess and resolve the conflict;(5)

     2.   voting in accordance with the instructions/consent of a client after
          providing notice of and disclosing the conflict to that client;

     3.   voting the proxy in accordance with the recommendation of an
          independent third-party service provider;

     4.   suggesting that the client engage another party to determine how the
          proxies should be voted;

     5.   delegating the vote to an independent third-party service provider; or

     6.   voting in accordance with the factors discussed in these Policies and
          Procedures.

PIMCO will document the process of resolving any identified material conflict of
interest.

- ----------
(5)  Any committee must be comprised of personnel who have no direct interest in
     the outcome of the potential conflict.

                                        2

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY VOTING RECORDS

Except to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise approved by PIMCO,
PIMCO will not disclose to third parties how it voted a proxy on behalf of a
client. However, upon request from an appropriately authorized individual, PIMCO
will disclose to its clients or the entity delegating the voting authority to
PIMCO for such clients (E.G., trustees or consultants retained by the client),
how PIMCO voted such client's proxy. In addition, PIMCO provides its clients
with a copy of these Policies and Procedures or a concise summary of these
Policies and Procedures: (i) in Part II of Form ADV; (ii) together with a
periodic account statement in a separate mailing; or (iii) any other means as
determined by PIMCO. The summary will state that these Policies and Procedures
are available upon request and will inform clients that information about how
PIMCO voted that client's proxies is available upon request.

PIMCO RECORD KEEPING

PIMCO or its agent maintains proxy voting records as required by Rule 204-2(c)
of the Advisers Act. These records include: (1) a copy of all proxy voting
policies and procedures; (2) proxy statements (or other disclosures accompanying
requests for client consent) received regarding client securities (which may be
satisfied by relying on obtaining a copy of a proxy statement from the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system or a third
party provided that the third party undertakes to provide a copy promptly upon
request); (3) a record of each vote cast by PIMCO on behalf of a client; (4) a
copy of any document created by PIMCO that was material to making a decision on
how to vote proxies on behalf of a client or that memorializes the basis for
that decision; and (5) a copy of each written client request for proxy voting
records and any written response from PIMCO to any (written or oral) client
request for such records. Additionally, PIMCO or its agent maintains any
documentation related to an identified material conflict of interest.

Proxy voting books and records are maintained by PIMCO or its agent in an easily
accessible place for a period of five years from the end of the fiscal year
during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in the
offices of PIMCO or its agent.

REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT

PIMCO's proxy voting procedures are described below. PIMCO's Compliance Group
will provide for the supervision and periodic review, no less than on a
quarterly basis, of its proxy voting activities and the implementation of these
Policies and Procedures.

Because PIMCO has contracted with State Street Investment Manager Solutions, LLC
("IMS West") to perform portfolio accounting, securities processing and
settlement processing on behalf of PIMCO, certain of the following procedures
involve IMS West in administering and implementing the proxy voting process. IMS
West will review and monitor the proxy voting process to ensure that proxies are
voted on a timely basis.

                                        3
<Page>

     1. TRANSMIT PROXY TO PIMCO. IMS West will forward to PIMCO's Middle Office
Group each proxy received from registered owners of record (E.G., custodian bank
or other third party service providers).

     2. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. PIMCO's Middle Office Group will review each
proxy to determine whether there may be a material conflict between PIMCO and
its client. As part of this review, the group will determine whether the issuer
of the security or proponent of the proposal is a client of PIMCO, or if a
client has actively solicited PIMCO to support a particular position. If no
conflict exists, this group will forward each proxy to the appropriate portfolio
manager for consideration. However, if a conflict does exist, PIMCO's Middle
Office Group will seek to resolve any such conflict in accordance with these
Policies and Procedures.

     3. VOTE. The portfolio manager will review the information, will vote the
proxy in accordance with these Policies and Procedures and will return the voted
proxy to PIMCO's Middle Office Group.

     4. REVIEW. PIMCO's Middle Office Group will review each proxy that was
submitted to and completed by the appropriate portfolio manager. PIMCO's Middle
Office Group will forward the voted proxy back to IMS West with the portfolio
manager's decision as to how it should be voted.

     5. TRANSMITTAL TO THIRD PARTIES. IMS West will document the portfolio
manager's decision for each proxy received from PIMCO's Middle Office Group in a
format designated by the custodian bank or other third party service provider.
IMS West will maintain a log of all corporate actions, including proxy voting,
which indicates, among other things, the date the notice was received and
verified, PIMCO's response, the date and time the custodian bank or other third
party service provider was notified, the expiration date and any action taken.

     6. INFORMATION BARRIERS. Certain entities controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with PIMCO ("Affiliates") may be engaged in banking,
investment advisory, broker-dealer and investment banking activities. PIMCO
personnel and PIMCO's agents are prohibited from disclosing information
regarding PIMCO's voting intentions to any Affiliate. Any PIMCO personnel
involved in the proxy voting process who are contacted by an Affiliate regarding
the manner in which PIMCO or its delegate intend to vote on a specific issue
must terminate the contact and notify the Compliance Group immediately.

CATEGORIES OF PROXY VOTING ISSUES

In general, PIMCO reviews and considers corporate governance issues related to
proxy matters and generally supports proposals that foster good corporate
governance practices. PIMCO considers each proposal on a case-by-case basis,
taking into consideration various factors and all relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. PIMCO may vote proxies as recommended by
management on routine matters related to the operation of the issuer and on
matters not expected to have a significant economic impact on the issuer and/or
shareholders, because PIMCO believes the recommendations by the issuer generally
are in shareholders' best

                                        4
<Page>

interests, and therefore in the best economic interest of PIMCO's clients. The
following is a non-exhaustive list of issues that may be included in proxy
materials submitted to clients of PIMCO, and a non-exhaustive list of factors
that PIMCO may consider in determining how to vote the client's proxies.

indemnification and liability protection: (i) indemnifying directors for conduct
in the normal course of business; (ii) limiting liability for monetary damages
for violating the duty of care; (iii) expanding coverage beyond legal expenses
to acts that represent more serious violations of fiduciary obligation than
carelessness (E.G. negligence); and (iv) providing expanded coverage in cases
where a director's legal defense was unsuccessful if the director was found to
have acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed was
in the best interests of the company.

on proposals on mandatory share ownership requirements for directors: (i) the

in excess of a simple majority.

other rights; (ii) whether the issuer expressly states that the stock will not
be used as a takeover defense or carry superior voting rights; (iii) whether the
issuer specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such
stock and the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable; and (iv) whether
the stated purpose is to raise capital or make acquisitions in the normal course

includes a spin-off, PIMCO may consider the tax and regulatory advantages,
planned use of sale proceeds, market focus, and managerial incentives. With
respect to a proxy proposal that includes an asset sale, PIMCO may consider the
impact on the balance sheet or working capital and the value received for the
asset. With respect to a proxy proposal that includes a liquidation, PIMCO may
consider management's efforts to pursue alternatives, the appraisal value of
assets, and the compensation plan for executives managing the liquidation.

     INVESTMENT COMPANY PROXIES
