                               GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                               Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                               structure combines the specialized expertise of
                               three world-class investment management groups--
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE          Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                               autonomously, relying on its own research and
                               staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                               that underlie its success.

                               FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                               recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                               also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                               U.S. equity investing.

                               TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                               international investing and, in 1954, launched
                               what has become the industry's oldest global
                               fund. Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                               Templeton offers investors a truly global
                               perspective.

                               MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                               dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                               searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                               it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                               arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION           Because our management groups work independently
                               and adhere to different investment approaches,
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                               typically have distinct portfolios. That's why
                               our funds can be used to build truly diversified
                               allocation plans covering every major asset
                               class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST      At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                               consistently provide investors with exceptional
                               risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                               as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                               that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                               names in financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +3.05% based on market price and +4.06% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of -0.59% in local currency terms
and -3.03% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period. 1 You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 8.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

The U.S. economy experienced solid growth during the period under review and
remained notably resilient despite high energy prices. In fourth quarter 2005,
the economy expanded 3.2% compared with the same quarter in 2004. Continued
productivity growth and job creation increased capital and labor utilization
and, in addition to higher global commodity prices, exerted some inflationary
pressures in the U.S. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) increased the
federal funds target rate 100 basis points (100 basis points equal one
percentage point) to 4.50% by period-end. Consistent with strong economic growth
and solid consumption trends, U.S. imports exceeded exports, driving the U.S.
trade balance to a $68.5 billion monthly deficit level by January 2006. 2 While
higher oil prices negatively impacted the deficit, the underlying trade balance
(not including oil) deteriorated, largely due to the widening trade deficit with
the Pacific Rim region. Furthermore, the U.S. current account deficit widened to
7.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) in fourth quarter 2005 versus 6.3% a year
earlier. 2

Although both the U.S. and Asia experienced strong growth in the second half of
2005, the large and growing current account deficit in the U.S. contrasted with
that of Asia, which has generally run significant surpluses. Characteristic of
the imbalance, investment-to-savings ratios showed a trend of lower savings
rates in the U.S., particularly among households and the government, as opposed
to higher savings rates and underinvestment in Asia. In 2005, robust export
performance and a competitive labor market led to better job and income growth,
which supported renewed consumption growth in many Asian

countries. However, investment growth failed to fully recover. Balance of
payment conditions supporting reserve accumulation remained intact in Asia over
the six-month period. This was most notable in China where foreign exchange
reserves reached $819 billion in December 2005. 3 Overall, aggregate demand
among Asian economies, such as in China, Singapore, Japan and South Korea,
continued to accelerate in fourth quarter 2005. Correspondingly, regional
interest rates tightened. For example, Thailand raised rates 150 basis points,
to 4.25%; South Korea 75 basis points to 4.00%; and Malaysia 55 basis points to
3.24%. 4

Economic activity in the 12-country euro zone accelerated in the second half of
2005. However, growth was still more moderate in Europe than in the U.S. or
Asia. Euro-zone GDP growth in the fourth quarter rose 1.7% compared with a year
earlier. 5 Although underlying inflationary pressures remained well contained,
higher energy prices and liquidity conditions prompted the European Central Bank
(ECB) to increase interest rates 25 basis points to 2.25% after being on hold
for 29 months. Central European economies also benefited from firmer euro-zone
growth conditions. Polish GDP growth rose 4.2% and Slovakia's GDP grew 7.5% in
fourth quarter 2005. 6 Prior fiscal reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies
enabled Slovakia to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERMII), the
precursor to adopting the euro, in November. Economic conditions in Norway and
Sweden remained characterized by large current account surpluses and solid
domestic growth conditions, led by labor market improvements. Correspondingly,
both the Norwegian and Swedish central banks tightened their monetary policies
in the six-month period.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency rates
and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

During the six-month review period, we shortened the Fund's overall duration,
particularly among our Asian and European holdings, as we anticipated a trend in
rising global interest rates led by the U.S. Fed. However, we found
opportunities to benefit Fund performance as we sought to take advantage of
local interest rate reductions. For example, the National Bank of Poland reduced
interest rates 75 basis points during the period to 4.25%, bolstering local bond
market returns to +3.55% in local currency terms. 7 Although Poland's economic
growth began to accelerate and was modestly above the euro zone's average during
the period, further currency appreciation, excess capacity and structural
changes pushed inflation below the central bank's inflation target, and consumer
price inflation fell from 4.4% at the end of 2004 to 0.7% in February 2006. 8
Another strong local market was Indonesia, which returned +17.27% in local
currency terms, as measured by the HSBC Asian Local Bond Index (ALBI) over the
six-month period. 9 The Indonesian markets responded favorably to the
government's decision to increase administered fuel prices to alleviate budget
pressures due to fuel subsidies, and the central bank's quick and decisive
actions that significantly raised rates. Conversely, as the U.K. treasury yield
curve inverted, our lack of exposure to the U.K. bond market, which we avoided
due to currency risk and bond valuations, detracted from the Fund's relative
performance.

CURRENCY STRATEGY

During the period under review, the U.S. dollar received some reprieve from the
depreciation trend that began in early 2002. The dollar appreciated 1.11%
against its major trading partners. 10 In particular, it appreciated 3.16%
against the euro and 4.22% against the yen. 11 The reprieve was likely due in
part to the U.S. Fed's interest rate increases, which amounted to 100 basis
points of tightening during the reporting period and 350 basis points since the
Fed began removing policy accommodation in the summer of 2004. Despite the
positive interest rate differential over other developed country interest rate
levels, the U.S. balance of payment position deteriorated, led by a ballooning
current account deficit and greater reliance on debt financing, particularly

from the government sector. In large part, the imbalance created by the
concurrence of a strong U.S. dollar and a deteriorated U.S. current account
deficit was offset by sufficient global market liquidity resulting from a large
global savings pool in Asia and oil exporting countries. The U.S. dollar also
found support from the Homeland Investment Act (HIA) that allowed corporations
to repatriate income accumulated abroad at more favorable tax rates. Support for
the dollar should fade in 2006 as the HIA is set to expire. Given the magnitude
of global economic imbalances, particularly between the U.S. and Asia, we
believe the U.S. dollar may need to weaken to help improve the U.S. current
account position over the medium term.

In the relatively difficult currency environment, currency diversification was
an important component of the Fund's relative outperformance over the JPM GGBI.
1 We significantly reduced our exposure to the euro and increased our allocation
to non-Japan Asia, non-euro Europe and the Americas outside the U.S. The
Canadian dollar and the South Korean won were among the largest positive
currency contributors to relative performance. Economic fundamentals remained
supportive of the Canadian dollar, which appreciated 4.41% against the U.S.
dollar, bringing the Canadian bond market's total return to +4.45% in U.S.
dollar terms for the six-month period. 7,11 Energy and commodity prices
continued to underpin Canada's overall economic environment. Additionally, the
higher commodity price environment bolstered Canada's balance of payment
position through higher exports and increased capital flows into the energy
sector. Asia experienced strength in domestic demand. A notable example is the
acceleration of South Korean private consumption in fourth quarter 2005 to 4.6%
from 0.6% a year earlier, which was preceded by greater consumer confidence and
higher property prices earlier in the year. 12 The South Korean won appreciated
7.16% against the U.S. dollar. 11 The Swedish krona and Norewegian krone
weakened more than the euro against the dollar, declining 4.10% and 5.34%, and
were among the more significant currency detractors from relative performance.
11 During the period, currency performance in Sweden and Norway suffered due to
their lower interest rates relative to other developed markets; however, both
countries maintained large current account and fiscal surpluses.

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also invested in investment-grade and subinvestment-grade sovereign
debt that typically compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher
yields relative to U.S. and European benchmark treasury curves. Despite rising
U.S. interest rates, U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt generated a
strong return of +7.17% over the period, as measured by the J.P. Morgan (JPM)
Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) Global. 13 Sovereign interest rate spreads
declined from 281 basis points at the beginning of the reporting period to 187
basis points by period-end. 14 Regionally, Latin American sovereign debt
returned +9.45%, Central and Eastern European +3.05% and Asian +6.42%. 13
Euro-denominated markets also rose, gaining +1.17% in euro terms, as measured by
the JPM Euro EMBI Global, but declined in U.S. dollar terms due to euro
volatility during the period. 15 We sought to take advantage of strength in
sovereign debt prices to reduce allocations to U.S. dollar-denominated credit,
particularly in Venezuela and Ukraine.

Performance Summary as of 2/28/06

Your dividend income will vary depending on dividends or interest paid by
securities in the Fund's portfolio, adjusted for operating expenses. Capital
gain distributions are net profits realized from the sale of portfolio
securities. Total return reflects reinvestment of the Fund's dividends and
capital gain distributions, if any, and any unrealized gains or losses. All
total returns include reinvested distributions according to the terms specified
in the Fund's dividend reinvestment and cash purchase plan and do not reflect
any sales charges paid at inception or brokerage commissions paid on secondary
market purchases. The performance table does not reflect any taxes that a
shareholder would pay on Fund dividends, capital gain distributions, if any, or
realized gains on the sale of Fund shares.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt and government securities generally trade in the over-the-counter
market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may utilize independent
pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services may use valuation models or matrix
pricing which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note
transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities
that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate
and maturity date, option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections,
interest rate spreads and yield curves, to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

The Fund may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates. A forward exchange contract is an agreement between
two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange rate at
a future date. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on
these contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income
and net realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation. Foreign
taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax regulations and rates that exist in
the foreign markets in which the Fund invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These differences may be
permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital
accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no impact
on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through February 28, 2006, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the period ended February 28,
2006, there were no share repurchases.

At February 28, 2006, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized
(without par value). During the period ended February 28, 2006, there were no
share transactions; all reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously
issued shares purchased in the open market. During the year ended August 31,
2005, 266,641 shares were issued for $2,550,011 from reinvested distributions.

                                             ===========

CURRENCY ABBREVIATIONS

8. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 15.60% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

9. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

10. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative
fees paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

11. REGULATORY MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, relating to certain practices in the
mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators.

Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning market timing (the "August 2, 2004 SEC
Order") and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund
shares (the "December 13, 2004 SEC Order") and with the California Attorney
General's Office ("CAGO") concerning marketing support payments to securities
dealers who sell fund shares (the "CAGO Settlement"). Under the terms of the
settlements with the SEC and the CAGO, the Company retained an Independent
Distribution Consultant ("IDC") to develop a plan for distribution of the
respective settlement monies. The CAGO approved the distribution plan under the
CAGO Settlement and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
settlement, the monies were disbursed to the relevant funds March 2005. The Fund
did not participate in the CAGO settlement. The SEC has not yet approved the
distribution plan pertaining to the December 13, 2004 SEC Order. When approved,
disbursements of settlement monies will be made promptly to the relevant funds,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of that order. The IDC has also
prepared and submitted to the SEC for its approval a plan of distribution under
the August 2, 2004 SEC Order that resolved the SEC's market timing
investigation.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, directors, and/or
employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as shareholder class
actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or
Franklin Resources, Inc.) relating to the industry practices referenced above,
as well as to allegedly excessive advisory fees, commissions, and/or 12b-1 fees.
The lawsuits were filed in different courts throughout the country. Many of
those suits are now pending in a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland.

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend
against them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual
outcome of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact
on the Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for
any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to Mellon
Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a
maximum of $5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her
account. These payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon
Bank, N.A." and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh,
PA 15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator
shall apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share
of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O.
Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds, less a
service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per share, to the
participant.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Limited in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in  analyzing  proxies,  the manager  subscribes  to  Institutional
Shareholder  Services (ISS), an  unaffiliated  third party corporate  governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote  recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third  party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses  and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  ISS'  and/or  Glass  Lewis'  analyses  are  thoroughly   reviewed  and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations   from  ISS,  Glass  Lewis  or  any  other  third  party  to  be
determinative  of the  manager's  ultimate  decision.  The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers,  directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose  interests  conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders.  All conflicts are resolved
in the  interests of the  manager's  clients.  In  situations  where the manager
perceives  a material  conflict  of  interest,  the manager  may:  disclose  the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees;  defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees,  ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another  independent
third party provider of proxy services;  or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF  AUDITORS  OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  In light of several  high
profile  accounting  scandals,  the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance  of  auditors.  On a  case-by-case  basis,  the manager will examine
proposals  relating to non-audit  relationships  and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis,  proposals to rotate auditors,  and
will  vote  against  the  ratification  of  auditors  when  there is  clear  and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders'  long-term interests.  The manager
evaluates  plans on a  case-by-case  basis by  considering  several  factors  to
determine   whether  the  plan  is  fair  and  reasonable,   including  the  ISS
quantitative  model  utilized  to assess  such  plans  and/or  the  Glass  Lewis
evaluation of the plans.  The manager will generally  oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively  dilutive,  and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater  options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support  employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information

processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow

Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the

Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered

relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
