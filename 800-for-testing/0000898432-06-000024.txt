CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report for the Neuberger Berman Real
Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2005.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments,
and its audited financial statements for the reporting period.

The Fund seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation as a
secondary objective. To pursue both, we have assembled a portfolio with a broad
mix of equity securities of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real
estate companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks real estate company securities that are
attractively priced relative to both their historical growth rates and the
valuation of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY

For the fiscal year ending October 31, 2005, on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis,
the Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (AMEX: NRO)
provided a 16.61% return, compared to a gain of 17.94% for the NAREIT Equity
REIT Index. The Fund's relative underperformance can be attributed to its
holdings of preferred real estate investment trust securities (REITs), which did
not perform as well as REIT common stocks. During the period, REITs generally
benefited from continued investor interest in this segment of the market and
ongoing improvement in REIT fundamentals. We expect REITs to continue to benefit
from improving fundamentals over the next couple of years.

REITs performed well across the board--office properties, regional malls,
apartments and industrial properties all provided strong returns. The office
sector benefited from improved economic growth and modest rent growth. Shares in
industrial properties rose as the demand for warehouse space increased, pension
funds became more interested in the sector and industrial property joint
ventures multiplied. Apartment properties fared well, reflecting the recent
improvement in fundamentals and rising occupancy rates. The apartment sector
also benefited from the perception that the market for housing sales has peaked.
Regional malls did well, in part due to healthy consumer spending and excellent
retail economics this year.

In this environment, the Fund benefited from the strength of--and an overweight
position in--the office sector. Health care REITs also performed well and the
Fund's holdings outperformed benchmark sector components. In the apartment
sector, the portfolio's market weight position in this strongly performing
segment helped overall returns. However, the hotel sector lagged, as did our
holdings in the group, as investors took gains made in 2004 and moved on to
other property areas. Community shopping centers also lagged behind other REIT
sectors, which we attribute to limited acquisition opportunities.

We believe that our emphasis on diversification across property sectors and
geographic regions continues to enhance the Fund's ability to deliver consistent
returns. The Fund's position in the office sector provides a good example.
Performance in this area improved during the first four months of calendar 2005,
reflecting the attractive valuation levels and dividend yields that were
prevalent in the sector at the start of the year. Since then, continued evidence
of an improving leasing environment has positively affected valuations. We
expect this trend to continue throughout 2006.

From a broader perspective, we remain optimistic about REIT fundamentals. As a
result of rising construction costs (a 10%-15% rise over the last 12 months,
concentrated in labor and raw materials), we believe that supply growth will
remain modest over the coming year. Furthermore, we remain positive on demand
growth, particularly in light of expectations for 3% GDP growth in 2006. We also
expect the Federal Reserve to complete its series of rate increases in the first
half of 2006. If this supply/demand environment continues, we anticipate a rise
in occupancy rates and rent levels for 2006, a scenario that bodes well for the
commercial real estate market.

Looking out into 2006, we expect higher interest rates to slow the housing boom
of the last several years. We also believe that investors will be able to
differentiate between declining homebuilding fundamentals and improving
commercial real estate fundamentals, which as we mentioned, we expect to benefit
from limited supply growth as well as our expectations for modest consumer
activity in 2006.

The REIT industry's solid earnings growth through the first three quarters of
2005 suggests to us a favorable earnings outlook for 2006. Commercial real
estate fundamentals remain attractive, which is consistent with market
expectations. We expect REIT dividend growth also to be attractive, at around 3%
to 4% in the coming 12 months.

In our view, continued healthy capital markets would be expected to lead to an
increase in merger and acquisition activity in 2006. Many REITs continue to
trade at modest discounts to their real estate asset value levels. Strategic
buyers, such as real estate opportunity funds, are becoming more aggressive in
their bidding for REITs, and are also comfortable with assigning value to the
"operating platform" of REITs. This operating platform offers the buyer growth
through an ongoing development and leasing pipeline. We expect the Fund to be a
beneficiary of this trend.

Sincerely,


                               /s/ Steven R. Brown

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in equity securities by Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities
     Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") are valued at the latest sale price where
     that price is readily available; securities for which no sales were
     reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at the last available bid
     price. Securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market are normally
     valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided
     by NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most recently reported price
     as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price is outside the range of
     the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid and asked prices that
     dealers quote to each other when trading for their own accounts); in that
     case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the inside bid or asked price,
     whichever is closer. Because of delays in reporting trades, the NOCP may
     not be based on the price of the last trade to occur before the market
     closes. The Fund values all other securities, including securities for
     which the necessary last sale, asked and/or bid prices are not readily
     available, by methods the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") has
     approved on the belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may
     be considered when determining the fair value of a security, including
     available analyst, media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and
     whether the issuer of the security being fair valued has other securities
     outstanding. Foreign security prices are furnished by independent quotation
     services and expressed in local currency values. Foreign security prices
     are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars using the exchange
     rate as of 12:00 noon, Eastern time. The Board has approved the use of FT
     Interactive Data Corporation ("FT Interactive") to assist in determining
     the fair value of the Fund's foreign equity securities when changes in the
     value of a certain index suggest that the closing prices on the foreign
     exchanges may no longer represent the amount that the Fund could expect to
     receive for those securities. In this event, FT Interactive will provide
     adjusted prices for certain foreign equity securities using a statistical
     analysis of historical correlations of multiple factors. In the absence of
     precise information about the market values of these foreign securities as
     of the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board has determined on
     the basis of available data that prices adjusted in this way are likely to
     be closer to the prices the Fund could realize on a current sale than are
     the prices of those securities established at the close of the foreign
     markets in which the securities primarily trade. However, fair value prices
     are necessarily estimates, and there is no assurance that such a price will
     be at or close to the price at which the security next trades. Short-term
     debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be valued at cost
     which, when combined with interest earned, approximates market value.
#    At cost, which approximates market value.
##   At October 31, 2005 the cost of investments for U.S. Federal income tax
     purposes was $717,981,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of investments was
     $106,860,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of investments was
     $7,901,000, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $98,959,000, based
     on cost for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
@    Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime Money") is also managed by
     Neuberger Berman Management Inc. (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements) and may be considered an affiliate since it has the same
     officers, Board members, and investment manager as the Fund and because, at
     times, the Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
     Prime Money.
^    All or a portion of this security is on loan (see Note A of Notes to
     Financial Statements).
++   Managed by an affiliate of Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and could be
     deemed an affiliate of the Fund (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements).
**   Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold, normally to qualified
     institutional buyers under Rule 144A, and have been deemed by the adviser
     to be liquid. At October 31, 2005, these securities amounted to $1,289,000
     or 0.2% of net assets.
@@   All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for interest
     rate swap contracts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
     "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as a
     non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Board of
     Directors of the Fund (the "Board") may classify or re-classify any
     unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred
     stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on a trade date basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
     ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any,
     are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest
     income, including accretion of original issue discount, where applicable,
     and accretion of discount on short-term investments, if any, is recorded on
     the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions
     and foreign currency transactions, if any, are recorded on the basis of
     identified cost and stated separately in the Statement of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to qualify
     as a regulated investment company by complying with the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
     investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its earnings to
     its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income or excise tax provision is
     required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by the Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by the Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2005, permanent differences resulting
     primarily from different book and tax accounting for distributions in
     excess of earnings and income recognized on interest rate swaps were
     reclassified at year end. These reclassifications had no effect on net
     income, net assets applicable to common shareholders or net asset value per
     common share of the Fund.

                                       12

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
     2005 and October 31, 2004 was as follows:

     As of October 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as follows:

     UNDISTRIBUTED         UNDISTRIBUTED             UNREALIZED                LOSS

</Table>

     The difference between book and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments and
     income recognized on interest rate swaps.

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of the Fund to declare quarterly
     and pay monthly distributions to common shareholders. The Fund has adopted
     a policy to pay common shareholders a stable monthly distribution. The
     Fund's ability to satisfy its policy will depend on a number of factors,
     including the stability of income received from its investments, the
     availability of capital gains, distributions paid on preferred shares, and
     the level of expenses. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution
     amount, the Fund may pay distributions consisting of net investment income,
     realized gains and paid-in capital. There is no assurance that the Fund
     will always be able to pay distributions of a particular size, or that
     distributions will consist solely of net investment income and realized
     capital gains. The composition of the Fund's distributions for the calendar
     year 2005 will be reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099. The Fund
     may pay distributions in excess of those required by its stable
     distribution policy to avoid excise tax or to satisfy the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Income distributions and capital
     gain distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Net
     realized capital gains, if any, will be offset to the extent of any
     available capital loss carryforwards. Any such offset will not reduce the
     level of the stable distribution paid by the Fund. Distributions to
     preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities issued
     by real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts
     ("REITs"). The distributions received from REITs held by the Fund are
     generally comprised of income, capital gains, and return of REIT capital,
     but the REITs do not report this information to the Fund until the
     following calendar year. At October 31, 2005, the Fund estimated these
     amounts within the financial statements since the information is not
     available from the REITs until after the Fund's fiscal year-end. For the
     year ended October 31, 2005, the character of distributions paid to
     shareholders is disclosed within the Statement of Changes and is also based
     on these estimates. All estimates are based upon REIT information sources
     available to the Fund together with actual IRS

                                       13
<Page>

     Forms 1099 received to date. Based on past experience it is probable that a
     portion of the Fund's distributions during the current fiscal year will be
     considered tax return of capital but the actual amount of tax return of
     capital, if any, is not determinable until after the Fund's fiscal year.
     After calendar year-end, when the Fund learns the nature of the
     distributions paid by REITs during that year, distributions previously
     identified as income are often recharacterized as return of capital and/or
     capital gain. After all applicable REITs have informed the Fund of the
     actual breakdown of distributions paid to the Fund during its fiscal year,
     estimates previously recorded are adjusted to reflect actual results. As a
     result, the composition of the Fund's distributions as reported herein may
     differ from the final composition determined after calendar year-end and
     reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099.

     On September 29, 2005, the Fund declared two monthly distributions to
     common shareholders in the amount of $0.10 per share per month, payable
     after the close of the reporting period, on November 30, 2005 and December
     30, 2005, to shareholders of record on November 14, 2005 and December 15,
     2005, respectively, with ex-dates of November 10, 2005 and December 13,
     2005, respectively.

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund.
     Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
     includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management
     serves as investment manager, that are not directly attributed to the Fund
     are allocated among the Fund and the other investment companies in the
     complex or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where
     a more appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund re-classified
     12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A Auction Market
     Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series C
     Auction Market Preferred Shares and Series D Auction Market Preferred
     Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27, 2004, the Fund issued 2,450 Series A AMPS,
     2,450 Series B AMPS, 2,450 Series C AMPS and 2,450 Series D AMPS. All AMPS
     have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
     unpaid distributions, whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but
     excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").

     Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period, distributions to
     preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily and paid
     every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C
     and Series D AMPS. Distribution rates are reset every 7 days for Series A
     and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS based on
     the results of an auction, except during special rate periods. For the year
     ended October 31, 2005, distribution rates ranged from 1.68% to 3.84% for
     Series A, 1.90% to 3.85% for Series B, 1.95% to 3.90% for Series C and
     1.87% to 3.75% for Series D AMPS. The Fund declared distributions to
     preferred shareholders for the period November 1, 2005 to November 30, 2005
     of ($196,518, $196,172, $200,104 and $197,838) for Series A, Series B,
     Series C and Series D AMPS, respectively.

     The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second business day
     preceding any distribution payment date at Liquidation Value. The Fund is
     also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.

                                       14
<Page>

     Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from
     declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
     shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation
     Value. The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote
     with holders of common shares as a single class, except that the AMPS will
     vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the
     Fund's charter. The holders of the AMPS, voting as a separate class, are
     entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a
     majority of the Directors of the Fund if the Fund fails to pay
     distributions on AMPS for two consecutive years.

8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
     transactions, with institutions that Management has determined are
     creditworthy, to reduce the risk that an increase in short-term interest
     rates could reduce common share net earnings as a result of leverage. Under
     the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Fund agrees to pay the
     swap counter party a fixed-rate payment in exchange for the counter party's
     paying the Fund a variable-rate payment that is intended to approximate all
     or a portion of the Fund's variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's
     AMPS. The fixed-rate and variable-rate payment flows are netted against
     each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other on a
     monthly basis. The Fund segregates cash or liquid securities having a value
     at least equal to the Fund's net payment obligations under any swap
     transaction, marked to market daily.

     Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to comply
     with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the failure of a
     counter party is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
     received by the Fund and/or the termination value at the end of the
     contract. Additionally, risks may arise from movements in interest rates
     unanticipated by Management.

     Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on the swaps
     are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized gains/losses, along with the
     fair value of the future periodic payment streams on the swaps. The
     unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic interim net interest
     payments are reclassified to realized gains/losses in conjunction with the
     actual net receipt or payment of such amounts. The reclassifications do not
     impact the Fund's total net assets applicable to common shareholders. At
     October 31, 2005, the Fund had outstanding interest rate swap contracts as
     follows:

     (1)  30 day LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)

9    SECURITY LENDING: Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities
     and Exchange Commission, the Fund entered into a Securities Lending
     Agreement ("Neuberger Agreement") on July 1, 2004 with Neuberger Berman,
     LLC ("Neuberger"), an affiliate of the Fund, pursuant to which Neuberger
     acted as the Fund's lending agent. Under the Neuberger Agreement, Neuberger
     guaranteed a certain amount of revenue to the Fund and received any revenue
     earned in excess of the guaranteed amount as a lending agency fee. For the
     year ended October 31, 2005, Neuberger received revenue under the Agreement
     of $115,558.

                                       15
<Page>

     On October 4, 2005, the Fund entered into new securities lending
     arrangements using a third party, eSecLending, to secure bids. Pursuant to
     such arrangements, eSecLending currently acts as agent for the Fund.

     Under the Neuberger Agreement and the new securities lending arrangements,
     the Fund receives cash collateral at the beginning of each transaction
     equal to at least 102% of the prior day's market value of the loaned
     securities (105% in the case of international securities). Prior to
     February 7, 2005, the Fund invested the cash collateral in the N&B
     Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Old Fund"), which was managed by
     State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street") pursuant to guidelines
     approved by Management. Effective February 7, 2005, the Fund changed the
     collateral investment vehicle from the Old Fund to the Neuberger Berman
     Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Quality Fund"), a fund managed by
     Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC, an affiliate of Management, as
     approved by the Board.

     Income earned on the securities loaned, if any, is reflected in the
     Statement of Operations under the caption "Income from securities
     loaned-affiliated issuers."

10   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
     institutions that Management has determined are creditworthy. Each
     repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The Fund requires that the
     securities purchased in a repurchase agreement be transferred to the
     custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the Fund to assert a perfected
     security interest in those securities in the event of a default under the
     repurchase agreement. The Fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the
     securities transferred to ensure that their value, including accrued
     interest, is greater than amounts owed to the Fund under each such
     repurchase agreement.

11   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN MANAGEMENT INC.:
     Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission, the Fund may invest in a money market fund managed by
     Management or an affiliate. Prior to December 2004, the Fund invested in
     the Neuberger Berman Institutional Cash Fund (the "Cash Fund"), as approved
     by the Board. As of December 2004, the Fund changed its investment from the
     Cash Fund to the newly created Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime
     Money"), as approved by the Board. The Cash Fund and Prime Money each seek
     to provide the highest available current income consistent with safety and
     liquidity. For any cash that the Fund invests in the Cash Fund or Prime
     Money, Management waives a portion of its management fee equal to the
     management fee it receives from the Cash Fund and Prime Money on those
     assets (the "Arrangement"). For the year ended October 31, 2005, management
     fees waived under this Arrangement with respect to the Cash Fund and Prime
     Money amounted to $591 and $2,471, respectively. For the year ended October
     31, 2005, income earned under this Arrangement with respect to the Cash
     Fund and Prime Money amounted to $10,010 and $88,781, respectively, and is
     reflected in the Statement of Operations under the caption "Income from
     investments in affiliated issuers."

12   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
     investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
     securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and
     non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving the majority
     of their revenue from the ownership, construction, financing, management
     and/or sale of commercial, industrial, and/or residential real estate.
     Values of the securities of such companies may fluctuate more due to
     economic, legal, cultural, geopolitical or technological developments
     affecting the United States real estate industry, or a segment of the
     United States real estate

                                       16
<Page>

     industry in which the Fund owns a substantial position, than would the
     shares of a fund not concentrated in the real estate industry.

13   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Fund's organizational
     documents provide that its officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Fund. In addition, both in some of its principal service contracts and in
     the normal course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against the Fund.

14   ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay all
     organizational expenses and the amount by which the Fund's offering costs
     for common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03 per share. There were
     no costs incurred by Management. Offering costs for common stock paid by
     the Fund were charged as a reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the
     completion of the Fund's offerings and amounted to $775,349.

     Additionally, offering costs of $299,820 and sales loads of $2,450,000
     incurred through the issuance of AMPS were charged as a reduction of common
     stock paid-in-capital at the completion of the Fund's AMPS offering.

     As of October 31, 2005, there was no remaining payable for offering costs.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, the Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the following annual rates:

</Table>

     Management has not contractually agreed to waive any portion of its fees
     beyond October 31, 2011.

     For the year ended October 31, 2005, such waived fees amounted to
     $1,999,303.

     The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. The Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street as its sub-administrator
     under a Sub-Administration Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee
     for all services received under the agreement.

                                       17
<Page>

     Management and Neuberger, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and
     sub-adviser to the Fund, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers
     Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly-owned holding company. Neuberger is
     retained by Management to furnish it with investment recommendations and
     research information without added cost to the Fund. Several individuals
     who are officers and/or Directors of the Fund are also employees of
     Neuberger and/or Management.

     The Fund has entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it
     to pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the
     commissions it pays to a broker that is not a related party of the Fund.
     Expenses paid through this program may include costs of custodial, transfer
     agency or accounting services. For the year ended October 31, 2005, the
     impact of this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $11,268.

     The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its custodian
     contract. For the year ended October 31, 2005, the impact of this
     arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $3,573.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, the Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that the
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the AMPS Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a minimum level
     set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to maintain the AAA/Aaa
     rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the fact that the rating
     agencies require the Fund, in performing this calculation, to discount
     portfolio securities below their face value, at rates determined by the
     rating agencies. The Fund pays a fee to State Street for the preparation of
     this report, which is reflected in the Statement of Operations under the
     caption "Basic maintenance expense."

     **   Prior to February 7, 2005, the Old Fund, an investment vehicle
          established by the Fund's custodian, was used to invest cash the Fund
          received as collateral for securities loans. Effective February 7,
          2005, the Fund changed the collateral investment vehicle from the Old
          Fund to the Quality Fund, a fund managed by Lehman Brothers Asset
          Management LLC, an affiliate of Management, as approved by the Board.
          The Fund's shares in the Old Fund and Quality Fund were and are
          non-voting. However, because all shares of the Old Fund and Quality
          Fund were and are held by funds in the related investment company
          complex, the Old Fund and Quality Fund may have been and may be
          considered affiliates of the Fund.

     ***  The Cash Fund and Prime Money are also managed by Management and may
          be considered affiliates since they have the same officers, Board
          members, and investment manager as the Fund and because, at times, the
          Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the
          Cash Fund or Prime Money, respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may
     be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Total return would
     have been lower if Management had not waived a portion of the investment
     management fee. Performance data current to the most recent month-end are
     available at www.nb.com.

#    The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

     not undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net expenses to
     average daily net assets applicable to common shareholders would have been:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund"), including
the schedule of investments, as of October 31, 2005, and the related statement
of operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. at October 31, 2005,
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and its financial
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (UNAUDITED)

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

                                       23
<Page>

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting held on September 21, 2005, the Board of Directors ("Board") of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. ("Fund"), including the
Directors who are not "interested persons" of the Fund ("Independent Fund
Directors"), approved continuance of the Management and Sub-Advisory Agreements
("Agreements") for the Fund.

In evaluating the Agreements, the Board, including the Independent Fund
Directors, reviewed materials furnished by Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC
("Neuberger") in response to questions submitted by counsel to the Independent
Fund Directors, and met with senior representatives of Management and Neuberger
regarding their personnel and operations. The Independent Fund Directors were
advised by counsel that is experienced in Investment Company Act of 1940 matters
and that is independent of Management and Neuberger. The Independent Fund
Directors received a memorandum from independent counsel discussing the legal
standards for their consideration of the proposed continuance of the Agreements.
They met with such counsel separately from representatives of Management to
discuss the annual contract review. The annual contract review extends over two
regular meetings of the Board to ensure that Management and Neuberger have time
to respond to any questions the Independent Fund Directors may have on their
initial review of the report and that the Independent Fund Directors have time
to consider those responses. In addition, during this process, the Board held a
separate meeting devoted to reviewing and discussing Fund performance.

The Board considered the following factors, among others, in connection with its
approval of the continuance of the Agreements: (1) the nature, extent, and
quality of the services to be provided by Management and Neuberger; (2) the
performance of the Fund compared to relevant market indices and a peer group of
investment companies; (3) the costs of the services to be provided and profits
historically realized by Management and its affiliates from the relationship
with the Fund; (4) the extent to which economies of scale might be realized as
the Fund grows; and (5) whether fee levels reflect those potential economies of
scale for the benefit of investors in the Fund. In their deliberations, the
Board members did not identify any particular information that was all-important
or controlling, and each Director may have attributed different weights to the
various factors.

The Board evaluated the terms of the Agreements and whether the Agreements were
in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The Board considered,
with respect to the Fund, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided under the Agreements and the overall fairness of the Agreements to the
Fund. The Board requested and evaluated a report from Management and Neuberger
that addressed specific factors designed to inform the Board's consideration of
these and other issues. The Board also retained an independent consultant to
provide additional data.

With respect to the nature, extent and quality of the services provided, the
Board considered the performance of the Fund and the degree of risk undertaken
by the portfolio manager. The Board considered the experience and staffing of
portfolio management and the investment research personnel of Management and
Neuberger dedicated to performing services for the Fund. The Board noted that
Management also provides certain administrative services, including fund
accounting and compliance oversight. The Board also considered Management's and
Neuberger's policies and practices regarding brokerage and allocation of
portfolio transactions for the Fund. The Board considered the quality of
brokerage execution provided by Management and its affiliates. The Board's
Portfolio Transactions and Pricing Committee from time to time reviews the
quality of the brokerage services that Neuberger and Lehman provide, and has
reviewed studies by independent firms engaged to review and evaluate the quality
of brokerage execution received by the Fund. In addition, the Board noted the
positive compliance history of Management and Neuberger, as each firm has been
free of significant compliance problems.

With respect to the performance of the Fund, the Board considered the
performance of the Fund on both a market return and net asset value basis
relative to its benchmark and a peer group of investment companies pursuing
broadly similar strategies. The Board also considered the performance in
relation to the degree of risk undertaken by the portfolio manager. The Board
noted the difficulty of constructing an appropriate peer group. The Board
discussed the Fund's performance with Management and discussed steps that
Management had taken, or intended to take, to improve the Fund's performance.
The Board also considered Management's resources and responsiveness with respect
to the Fund.

                                       37

With respect to the overall fairness of the Agreements, the Board considered the
fee structure of the Agreements as compared to a peer group of comparable funds
and any fall-out benefits likely to accrue to Management or Neuberger or their
affiliates. The Board also considered the profitability of Management and its
affiliates from their association with the Fund.

The Board received a detailed report from an independent consultant that
compares the Fund's management fee and overall expense ratio to a peer group of
comparable funds. The Board considered the range and average of the management
fees and expense ratios of the peer group. The Board noted that the Fund's
actual management fee was higher than the peer group median. The Board
considered whether specific portfolio management or administration needs
contributed to the higher fee. With regard to the sub-advisory fee paid to
Neuberger, the Board noted that this fee is reflective of an "at cost" basis and
there is no profit to Neuberger with regard to these fees. The Board considered
the Fund's overall expenses in relation to the overall expenses of the peer
group median. In addition, the Board considered the contractual waiver of a
portion of the management fee undertaken by Management.

The Board considered whether there were other funds that were sub-advised by
Management or its affiliates or separate accounts managed by Management with
similar investment objectives, policies and strategies as the Fund. The Board
compared the fees charged to a comparable sub-advised fund and comparable
separate accounts to the fees charged to the Fund. The Board considered the
appropriateness and reasonableness of the differences between the fees charged
between the Fund and the comparable sub-advised fund and comparable separate
accounts and determined that the differences in fees were consistent with the
management and other services provided.

The Board also evaluated any actual or anticipated economies of scale in
relation to the services Management provides to the Fund. The Board considered
that the Fund was a closed-end fund that is not continuously offering shares and
that, without daily inflows and outflows of capital, there were not at this time
significant economies of scale to be realized by Management in managing the
Fund's assets.

In concluding that the benefits accruing to Management and its affiliates by
virtue of their relationship to the Fund were reasonable in comparison with the
costs of providing the investment advisory services and the benefits accruing to
the Fund, the Board reviewed specific data as to Management's profit or loss on
the Fund for a recent period and the trend in profit or loss since the Fund's
inception. The Board also carefully examined Management's cost allocation
methodology and had an independent expert review the methodology. It also
reviewed an analysis from an independent data service on investment management
profitability margins. The Board also reviewed whether Management and Neuberger
used brokers to execute Fund transactions that provide research and other
services to Management and Neuberger, and the types of benefits potentially
derived by the Fund and by other clients of Management and Neuberger from such
services. The Board recognized that Management should be entitled to earn a
reasonable level of profits for services it provides to the Fund and, based on
its review, concluded it was satisfied that Management's level of profitability
from its relationship with the Fund was not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

In approving the Agreements, the Board concluded that the terms of each
Agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the Agreements is in the
best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. In reaching this determination,
the Board considered that Management and Neuberger could be expected to provide
a high level of service to the Fund; that it retained confidence in Management's
and Neuberger's capabilities to manage the Fund; that the Fund's fee structure
appeared to the Board to be reasonable given the quality of services expected to
be provided; and that the benefits accruing to Management and its affiliates by
virtue of their relationship to the Fund were reasonable in comparison with the
costs of providing the investment advisory services and the benefits accruing to
the Fund.

and any entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under  common  control with the
adviser  that  provides  ongoing  services  to  the  Registrant  that  were  not

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

Registrant's Annual Report, which is included as Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board has  delegated  to  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger  Berman") the
responsibility  to vote  proxies  related to the  securities  held in the Fund's
portfolios.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by the Board to
vote proxies  related to portfolio  securities in the best interests of the Fund
and its  stockholders.  The Board  permits  Neuberger  Berman to contract with a
third party to obtain proxy voting and related services,  including  research of
current issues.

<PAGE>

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger  Berman has voting  authority,  including the Fund. The Proxy
Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman  addresses any conflicts that
may arise  between its  interests and those of its clients with respect to proxy
voting.

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)      Based on an evaluation of the  disclosure  controls and  procedures (as
         defined in rule 30a-3(c) under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as
         amended  (the "Act")) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of
         this document,  the Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Principal
         Financial and Accounting  Officer of the Registrant have concluded that
         such  disclosure  controls and procedures are  effectively  designed to
         ensure that  information  required to be disclosed by the Registrant is
         accumulated and  communicated to the  Registrant's  management to allow
         timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)      There were no significant changes in the Registrant's internal controls
         over  financial  reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d)  under the Act)
         that occurred during the  Registrant's  last fiscal half-year that have
         materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
         Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT (A)(1) CODE OF ETHICS
<TEXT>
                                                                EXHIBIT 12(a)(1)

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF NEUBERGER BERMAN FUNDS

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

This code of ethics ("Code") for the registered investment companies within the
Neuberger Berman Fund complex (each, a "Company") applies to each Company's
Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is listed in Exhibit
A). The purpose of the Code is to promote:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that a Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Company;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to  an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL, POTENTIAL AND APPARENT
     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual,
potential and apparent conflicts of interest.

     An "actual conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of his or her position with the Company.

     A "potential conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest is such that it might, under certain circumstances, interfere with the
interests of the Company or the Officer's service to the Company, but those
circumstances do not now exist.


<PAGE>

     Appearances may create an "apparent conflict of interest" even when an
actual conflict does not exist. For example, an apparent conflict may exist if a
Covered Officer owns a thinly traded security that a series of a Company (a
"Fund") is buying, even if there is no actual conflict of interest.

     Certain actual or potential conflicts of interest may arise out of the
relationships between Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940
("Investment Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Company. The compliance programs and procedures of Neuberger Berman Management
Inc., Neuberger Berman, LLC (collectively referred to as the "investment
adviser") and each Company are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
of the parameters of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, actual or potential conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
contractual relationship between the Company and the investment adviser of which
the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the Company or for the investment adviser, or for both),
be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the adviser and the Company. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser and is consistent with the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Company.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Companies' Boards of
Trustees/Directors ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal interest
of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the
Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not
exhaustive.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships  improperly
         to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the

                                        2
<PAGE>

         Company,  as for  example  where  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
         personally to the detriment of the Company;

     o   cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Company;

     o   retaliate against any other Covered Officer, or any employee of a
         Company, its service providers, or the affiliated persons of any of
         them, for good faith reports of potential violations of this Code.

     There are some actual or potential conflict of interest situations that
should always be approved by the Company's Chief Legal Officer1 if material.
Covered Officers are encouraged to discuss with the Chief Legal Officer any
potential conflict the materiality of which is uncertain. Examples of reportable
conflicts include:

     o   service as a director on the board of any public or private company,
         other than the Companies, their investment adviser, and its affiliates;

     o   the  receipt of any non-nominal  gifts,  i.e., those in excess of $100;

     o   the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
         Company has current or prospective business dealings unless such
         entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
         to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
         impropriety;

     o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
         adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
         charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each Covered Officer must familiarize himself or herself with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company and the
         Company's Disclosure Controls and Procedures;

     o   each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
         to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
         outside the Company, including to the Company's trustees/directors and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

- ----------------
1    The Board of each  Company has  appointed Maxine L. Gerson as  Chief Legal
     Officer.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     o   each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
         her area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
         of the Companies and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
         accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
         documents the Companies file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
         public communications made by the Companies; and

     o   each Covered Officer should promote compliance with the standards and
         restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he or she has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
         with the requirements of the Code;

     o   report on the Company's Questionnaire for Trustees/Directors and
         Officers, where responsive to appropriate questions, all categories of
         affiliations or other relationships giving rise to actual or potential
         conflicts of interest; and

     o   notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly if he or she is aware of facts
         and circumstances that he or she knows are a violation of this Code.
         Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation.2 However, any approvals or
waivers3 sought by the Principal Executive Officer will be considered by the
Independent Trustees/ Directors of the affected Company (the "Committee").

- ----------------
2    The Chief Legal Officer is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with
     counsel to the Company and counsel to the Independent Trustees/Directors,
     and is encouraged to do so.
3    Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the registrant's failure to take action within a reasonable
     period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code
     of ethics that has been made known to an executive officer" of the
     registrant. Both waivers and implicit waivers must be disclosed publicly.


                                        4
<PAGE>

     The Companies will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any potential violations reported to him or her.

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will report to the Committee the outcome of the
         investigation, including the facts of the initial report, the scope and
         outcome of the investigation, and whether or not the Chief Legal
         Officer believes that a violation occurred.

     o   The person who initially reported the matter will be informed that the
         matter has been investigated and reported to the Committee.

     o   If the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will inform
         and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate
         action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
         applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate
         personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation
         to dismiss the Covered Officer.

     o The Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

     o   Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Companies for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Companies, the investment adviser, the Companies'
principal underwriter, or other service providers purport to apply a lesser
standard to the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Companies' and the investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and the investment
adviser's more detailed policies and procedures set forth in Neuberger Berman
Management Inc.'s Compliance Manual are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not preempted by this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
Independent Trustees/Directors.

                                        5
<PAGE>

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Company, its Board (and any
Committee of the Board) and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Companies and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
