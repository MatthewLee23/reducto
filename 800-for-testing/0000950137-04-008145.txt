Fund Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2004

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund is managed by the Adviser's Senior Loans team, led
by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director of the Adviser.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 was a highly favorable period for the
senior-loan market. Strong fundamental factors worked in the market's favor:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth topped 4 percent at an annual rate for three
of the last four calendar quarters, inflation remained in check, and interest
rates finally began to rise in early 2004. As the economy continued to improve,
so too did corporate financial performance. Over the past few years, companies
have had to become much more efficient in order to thrive in an era of lower
prices and greater competition. Companies' gains in efficiency have led to
considerable operating leverage, which has helped boost profits. These factors,
coupled with improving credit quality and rising productivity, all contributed
to the senior loan market's strong performance during the period.

Yield spreads in the senior-loan market (the yield differential between senior
loans and short-term lending rates, such as LIBOR) continued to contract,
reaching near-historic lows by the end of the reporting period. This narrowing
of spreads enabled more companies to access the senior-loan market at very
favorable terms. At the same time, demand for and inflows into senior loans
continued to rise, particularly from institutional investors, as the asset class
has gained growing recognition as a defensive investment. Significantly lower
default rates also added to the attractiveness of the senior-loan market. As a
result, investors readily absorbed the record amounts of new issues that came to
market during the period, and demand and supply remained in equilibrium.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 12.03 percent for the 12-month period ended July 31, 2004
(Class B shares unadjusted for sales charges).

The performance for the two share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results. See Performance Summary for standardized performance information.

We believe that the fund's strong performance is the result, in part, of our
successfully working through the more challenging credits of the past--a process
that can take up to two years to complete. It is also a reflection of our
larger, experienced team of analysts and the thorough fundamental research they
conduct, which we believe has led to better investment decisions. We continue to
focus on identifying those companies that exhibit strong management, solid and
predictable cash flows, and collateral that is sufficient to provide a healthy
"second way out." This bottom-up security-selection process resulted in an
emphasis on the cable, printing and publishing, and health-care sectors during
the reporting period. We also identified some attractive opportunities in
telecommunications, and we added slightly to the portfolio's holdings in this
sector. The fund's allocation to hotels, motels and gaming also increased during
the reporting period. This industry has been strong this year as consumers are
generally traveling and spending more, and our analysis identified issuers that
offered compelling returns with strong asset coverage.

In an effort to limit risk, we continued to keep the fund broadly diversified,
which helps enhance the portfolio's defensive characteristics. In addition,
while we do not practice sector selection, we do avoid certain industries that
have historically been poor performers in the senior-loan arena, such as fashion
and retail.

Looking ahead, while growth in corporate profits may level off, we believe that
absolute profitability and pricing power are likely to remain strong and that
companies will be able to continue to generate free cash-flow. For these
reasons, we believe the environment for senior loans should continue to be quite
favorable in the coming months. We will continue with our disciplined investment
approach, seeking a relatively stable net asset value for the fund and
attractive yields.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. Bank
    loan ratings are unaudited.

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) Payment-in-kind security.

(b) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(c) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(d) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(e) This borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(f) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2004.

(g) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(h) Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(i) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 3.4%
    of the net assets of the Fund.

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

(j) A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded loan
    commitments.

(k) Subsequent to July 31, 2004, this borrower has emerged from bankruptcy.

(l) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate
Senior Loans. Senior Loans are business loans that have a senior right to
payment and are made to borrowers that may be corporations, partnerships, or
other entities. These borrowers operate in a variety of industries and
geographic regions. The Fund commenced investment operations on October 4, 1989.
In June 2003, the Fund completed a transaction in which it redesignated its
shares issued before June 13, 2003 as Class B Shares and issued new Class C
Shares to the shareholders of Van Kampen Senior Floating Rate Fund in exchange
for the assets and liabilities of that fund. Effective November 30, 2003, the
Fund's investment adviser, Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. merged into Van
Kampen Asset Management.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans are valued by the Fund following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Fund's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate redetermination period and
maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the
period until the next interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such
Senior Loans. Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial
paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate
securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the
Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by
the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Fund acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified

                                                                              31

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

price. Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt
security. The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical
delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian
bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at
not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for service
fees, which are applicable only to Class C shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2004, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $959,524,180, which will expire between July 31, 2006 and
July 31, 2012.

    At July 31, 2004, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Fund declares daily and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, are
distributed at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains for book
purposes may include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary
income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended July 31, 2004
and 2003 was as follows:

<Table>

                                                                 2004           2003
<S>                                                           <C>            <C>
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income...........................................  $60,620,611    $81,893,753
  Return of capital.........................................    5,601,584      7,342,843
                                                              -----------    -----------
                                                              $66,222,195    $89,236,596
                                                              ===========    ===========
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between financial and tax basis reporting for the 2004 fiscal year have been
identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Permanent differences relating to return of capital distributions
totaling $5,601,584 were reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to capital. Also, permanent differences relating to book to
tax amortization differences totaling $6,336,615 were reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss. A permanent book-to-tax difference related to capital losses brought
forward from the Target Fund of $82,383,366 was reclassified from accumulated
net realized loss to capital. Finally, $3,643,444 relating to a portion of the
capital loss carryforward that expired during the year was reclassified from
accumulated net realized loss to capital.

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses related to wash sale
transactions, post October losses which may not be recognized for tax purposes
until the first day of the following fiscal year, and losses that were
recognized for book purposes but not for tax purposes at the end of the fiscal
year.

F. CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES During the year ended July 31, 2004, the
Fund's custody fee was reduced by $25,692 as a result of credits earned on cash
balances.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Fund for an annual fee payable
monthly as follows:

<Table>

Next $500 million...........................................     .800%
Over $3.0 billion...........................................     .775%
</Table>

    Effective June 1, 2004 the management fee was reduced from .95% for the
first $4.0 billion, .90% for the next $3.5 billion, .875% for the next $2.5
billion, and .85% for any average daily net assets greater than $10.0 billion.

                                                                              33

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

    In addition, the Fund will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen
Funds Inc., the Fund's Administrator, at an annual rate of .25% of the average
daily net assets of the Fund. The administrative services provided by the
Administrator include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any
agreements with respect to participations and assignments, record keeping
responsibilities with respect to interests in Senior Loans in the Fund's
portfolio and providing certain services to the holders of the Fund's
securities.

    For the year ended July 31, 2004, the Fund recognized expenses of
approximately $667,800 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Fund, of which a Trustee of the Fund
is an affiliated person.

    Under a Legal Services agreement, the Adviser provides legal services to the
Fund. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to each Fund. For the year
ended July 31, 2004, the Fund recognized expenses of approximately $78,700
representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van
Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the Fund, which are reported as
part of the "Legal" expenses in the Statement of Operations.

    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc. (VKIS), an affiliate of the Adviser,
serves as the shareholder servicing agent of the Fund. For the year ended July
31, 2004, the Fund recognized expenses for these services of approximately
$1,821,200 representing transfer agency fees paid to VKIS. Transfer agency fees
are determined through negotiations with the Fund's Board of Trustees.

    Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of
Van Kampen. The Fund does not compensate its officers or Trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Fund provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
Trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, Trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each Trustee's years of service to the Fund.
The maximum annual benefit per Trustee under the plan is $2,500.

commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of the credit line.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At July 31, 2004, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation
basis.

</Table>

9. SERVICE PLAN

For Class C, the Fund has adopted a Service Plan (the "Plan") designed to meet
the service fee requirements of the sales charge rule of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The Plan governs payments for personal
services and/or the maintenance of shareholder accounts.

    Annual fees under the Plan of .15% (.25% maximum) of average daily net
assets are accrued daily and paid monthly to Van Kampen for Class C. Of this
amount, Van Kampen paid Morgan Stanley DW Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor,
approximately $62,500 for the year ended July 31, 2004.

10. LITIGATION

On September 28, 2001 and October 11, 2001, separate complaints were filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois each by a
shareholder of the Fund against the Fund, the Adviser, Van Kampen Funds Inc. and
certain directors and officers of the Fund. The respective complaints, framed as
class actions, allege misstatements and omissions in the Fund's registration
statements in violation of the federal securities laws. The separate complaints
were consolidated on or about December 15, 2001, and the class was certified on
or about August 26, 2002. The consolidated action is entitled Abrams et al. v.
Van Kampen Funds, Inc., et al., No. 01 C 7538 (N.D. Ill., Hart J.). The ultimate
outcome of this action is not presently determinable and no provision has been
made in the Fund's financial statements for the effect, if any, of this action.

                                                                              39

11. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights

    We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company

disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of July 31, 2004, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Fund's Board of Trustees has determined that it has one "audit committee
financial expert" serving on its audit committee, "independent" Trustee Rod
Dammeyer. Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an
audit committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or identified as an audit committee
financial expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not impose on such person any duties,
obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations, and
liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the audit committee and Board
of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

                          AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months

- ----------------
(1) This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), adopted as of the date above, supercedes
and replaces all prior versions that may have been adopted from time to time.
(2) Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>


from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides
a different period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually
review and pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent
Auditors without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee. The
Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the list of general pre-approved
services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.

2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following Audit services. All
other Audit services not listed below must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated):
    -    Statutory audits or financial audits for the Fund
    -    Services associated with SEC registration statements (including new
         funds), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or
         other documents issued in connection with securities offerings (e.g.,
         comfort letters for closed-end fund offerings, consents), and
         assistance in responding to SEC comment letters
    -    Consultations by the Fund's management as to the accounting or
         disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or
         potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or
         interpretations by the SEC, FASB, or other regulatory or standard
         setting bodies (Note: Under SEC rules, some consultations may be "audit
         related" services rather than "audit" services)

<PAGE>



4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following Audit-related
services. All other Audit-related services not listed below must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated):
    -    Attest procedures not required by statute or regulation (including
         agreed upon procedures related to the Closed-End Fund asset coverage
         tests required by the rating agencies and/or lenders)
    -    Due diligence services pertaining to potential fund mergers
    -    Issuance of SAS-70 reports on internal controls of Morgan Stanley
         Trust Co. and MSIM Trade Operations
    -    Consultations by the Fund's management as to the accounting or
         disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or
         potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or
         interpretations by the SEC, FASB, or other regulatory or
         standard-setting bodies (Note: Under SEC rules, some consultations may
         be "audit" services rather than "audit-related" services)
    -    Information systems reviews not performed in connection with the audit
         (e.g., application data center and technical reviews)
    -    General assistance with implementation of the requirements of SEC rules
         or listing standards promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    -    Audit of record keeping services performed by Morgan Stanley Trust Fund
         related to the New Jersey State Retirement Plan

5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the following Tax Services. All Tax services involving large and
complex transactions not listed below must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any

<PAGE>

executive officer or trustee/director/managing general partner of the Fund, in
his or her individual capacity, where such services are paid for by the Fund
(generally applicable only to internally managed investment companies):

    -    U.S. federal, state and local tax planning and advice
    -    U.S. federal, state and local tax compliance
    -    International tax planning and advice
    -    International tax compliance
    -    Review of federal, state, local and international income, franchise,
         and other tax returns
    -    Identification of Passive Foreign Investment Companies
    -    Review of closed-end funds pro rata allocation of taxable income and
         capital gains to common and preferred shares.
    -    Domestic and foreign tax planning, compliance, and advice
    -    Assistance with tax audits and appeals before the IRS and similar
         state, local and foreign agencies
    -    Tax advice and assistance regarding statutory, regulatory or
         administrative developments (e.g., excise tax reviews, evaluation of
         Fund's tax compliance function)
    -    Review the calculations of taxable income from corporate actions
         including reorganizations related to bankruptcy filings and provide
         guidance related to the foregoing

6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following All Other services.
Permissible All Other services not listed below must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated):

    -    Risk management advisory services, e.g., assessment and testing of
         security infrastructure controls

         The following is a list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services. The
SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be consulted to determine the precise
definitions of these services and the applicability of exceptions to certain of
the prohibitions:
    -    Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
         financial statements of the audit client
    -    Financial information systems design and implementation
    -    Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-
         kind reports
    -    Actuarial services
    -    Internal audit outsourcing services
    -    Management functions
    -    Human resources
    -    Broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services
    -    Legal services
    -    Expert services unrelated to the audit

7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these



<PAGE>

levels or amounts will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The
Audit Committee is mindful of the overall relationship of fees for audit and
non-audit services in determining whether to pre-approve any such services. For
each fiscal year, the Audit Committee may determine the appropriate ratio
between the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for
the Fund (including any Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
and management will immediately report to the chairman of the Audit Committee
any breach of this Policy that comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief
Financial Officer or any member of management.

9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:

    -    Van Kampen Investments, Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corporation
    -    Van Kampen Asset Management Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Trust Company

    -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Management Inc.
    -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.
    -    Morgan Stanley Investments LP
    -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company

(e)(2)   Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services are determined to have a direct impact
on the operations or financial reporting of the Registrant. 100% of such
services were pre-approved by the audit committee pursuant to the Audit
Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures (attached hereto).

(f)      Not applicable.

(g)      See table above.

(h)      The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

Not applicable.

Item 6.  [Reserved.]

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Fund invests in exclusively non-voting securities and therefore this item is
not applicable to the Fund.

Item 8.  Purchase of Equity Securities by Closed-End Management Investment
Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

Not Applicable.

Item 9.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not Applicable.

Item 10. Controls and Procedures

(a) The Fund's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the Fund's disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Fund in this Form N-CSR
was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, based
upon such officers' evaluation of these controls and procedures as of a date
within 90 days of the filing date of the report.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year
(the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003, AS AMENDED AUGUST 11, 2004



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         -     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
               actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
               professional relationships.

         -     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
               reports and documents that a company files with, or submits to,
               the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other
               public communications made by the Fund;

         -     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
               regulations;

         -     prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
               appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         -     accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in

<PAGE>


such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund and
the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered
Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In
addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees ("Boards")
that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         -     use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly
               to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the
               Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally
               (directly or indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund;

         -     cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
               individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
               the benefit of the Fund; or

         -     use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
               or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund
               to trade personally or cause others to trade personally in
               contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code,
report to the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business
relationships outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report
annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         -     service or significant business relationships as a director on
               the board of any public or private company;

         -     accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
               gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person
               or entity with which the Fund has current or prospective business
               dealings, not including occasional meals or tickets for theatre
               or sporting events or other similar entertainment; provided it is
               business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
               place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
               impropriety;

         -     any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
               relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
               than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
               affiliated person thereof; and

         -     a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
               transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
               portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
               than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment,
               such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         -     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
               disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to
               the Funds;

         -     each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
               others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
               within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
               Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
               and self-regulatory organizations;

         -     each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
               area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
               of the Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of
               promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
               disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or
               submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the
               Funds; and

         -     it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
               compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
               applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         -     upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
               becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that
               he has received, read and understands the Code;

         -     annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
               with the requirements of the Code;

         -     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or
               any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports
               of potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         -     notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects
               of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a
               violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         -     the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
               investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         -     if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that
               no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to
               take any further action;

         -     any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will
               be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;



- --------------------
(3) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."



<PAGE>


         -     if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
               "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act
               (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners")
               of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they
               will consider appropriate action, which may include review of,
               and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and
               procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the
               investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss
               the Covered Officer or other appropriate disciplinary actions;

         -     the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of
               the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of
               this Code, as appropriate; and

         -     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
               required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B
or C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

I, Ronald E. Robison, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   [Omitted]

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date

     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the

          which this report is being prepared;

          evaluation; and

          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year

          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and
