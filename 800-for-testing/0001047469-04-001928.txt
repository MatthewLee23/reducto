EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST as of November 30, 2003

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J.FETTER]
Thomas J. Fetter
President

Amid the market volatility and external political shocks of recent years, many
investors have become more concerned with risk management. That trend has been
especially true in the municipal bond market, where the use of bond insurance
has become increasingly common. Today, roughly half of all municipal bond
issuance is composed of insured bonds. As part of our continuing educational
series, we thought it might be helpful to discuss bond insurance and its impact
on the municipal market.

THE USE OF BOND INSURANCE HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS...

Municipal bond insurance was initially developed in 1971, when AMBAC Assurance
Corp., the nation's first municipal insurer, offered insurance as a way to
guarantee principal and interest payments on bond issues in the event of a bond
default. Over the following three decades, the municipal market has witnessed a
surge in the use of insurance. For example, in 1980, just 3% of all municipal
issuance was insured. However, by late 2003, that figure had risen to roughly
50%. Insurance has clear benefits for purchasers: the elimination of default
risk of the underlying issuer, AAA quality ratings and an enhancement of an
issue's liquidity. (It's important to note that, while insured bonds are insured
as to principal and interest payments, they still remain subject to interest
rate and market risks.)

THE MECHANICS OF MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE...

We start with the underlying reality that an issuer with a AAA credit rating
will pay less in interest expense than an issuer with a lower credit rating.
Thus, an issuer must first determine whether purchasing insurance is financially
feasible. That is, will the interest savings offset the cost of insurance? If
so, the issuer must then qualify for insurance. Just as an individual must
qualify for insurance, so too must a bond issuer meet certain criteria. The
issuer provides key financial data and documents to potential insurers that are
then used to assess the issuer's financial strength and underlying fundamentals.
If the issuer qualifies, insurance is then effected by "direct purchase," with
the payment of a one-time premium by the issuer. The premium fee is calculated
as a percentage of the value of the bond issue - typically, around 50 basis
points (0.50%), but more if the credit entails higher risk. (An alternative
method of purchase involves "elective bidding," in which the insurance is
purchased by bond dealers, who determine at the time the bond is sold whether it
is more attractive as an insured or uninsured bond.)

IN-DEPTH CREDIT ANALYSIS INCLUDES INSURERS AS WELL AS BOND ISSUERS...

When analyzing municipal bonds, an investor naturally researches the issuer's
fundamentals. However, if the bond is insured, the analyst is concerned with the
soundness of the insurer as well. At Eaton Vance, analysis of the insured
segment is an integral part of our total municipal research effort. Research
includes, among other areas, analysis of an insurer's claims-paying ability, its
capital structure and the overall quality of its portfolio of policies. Based on
claims-paying ability, there are currently six bond insurers rated AAA by
Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch - the nation's leading
rating agencies.

INSURERS CAN PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN STRUCTURING BOND DEALS AND IMPROVING CREDIT
QUALITY...

Insurers play an important role in capital formation for municipal borrowers,
working closely with municipal officials to forge deals that raise capital for
vital projects at affordable interest rates. In so doing, the insurers can help
states and municipalities achieve more efficient fiscal management. Insurers
often re-structure bond deals by insisting on provisions that are intended to
make the deal more secure. That has proved a major benefit to investors in
recent years. In a more risk-conscious climate, we believe that an ongoing
analysis of the insured market is a necessary discipline to invest successfully
in today's municipal market.

                                Sincerely,
                              /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

                                Thomas J. Fetter
                                President
                                January 7, 2004

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

[PHOTO OF THOMAS M. METZOLD]
Thomas M. Metzold
Portfolio Manager

INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT

- - The U.S. economy saw encouraging growth in the year ended November 30, 2003.
  Consumer spending picked up, as tax cuts added to discretionary incomes.
  Capital spending, which had been very slow to recover, rebounded. Gross
  Domestic Product grew 3.3% in the second quarter of calendar year 2003,
  followed by a surprisingly strong 8.2% rise in the third quarter. The labor
  markets were slow to rebound. The nation's unemployment rate was 5.9% in
  November 2003.

- - Inflation, meanwhile, remained modest. Prices for finished goods remained
  stable, although health care costs continued to rise and prices for
  manufacturing inputs and commodities such as oil and natural gas remained
  high. The Federal Reserve maintained an accommodative monetary policy, holding
  its Federal Funds rate - a key short-term interest rate barometer - at 1.00%,
  where it has stood since June.

- - While signs of a more robust economy drove a strong rally in the equity
  markets, the bond markets gave up some of their gains of the past year.
  Ten-year Treasury bond yields - which had fallen to 3.40% in late May - rose
  to 4.37% by November 30, 2003, in response to a reviving economy, prompting a
  market correction. Nonetheless, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index
  posted a solid total return of 6.65% for the year ended November 30, 2003.(1)

THE TRUST

PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST YEAR

- - Based on share price (traded on the New York Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
  total return of 20.02% for the year ended November 30, 2003. That return was
  the result of an increase in share price from $14.05 on November 30, 2002, to
  $15.55 on November 30, 2003, and the reinvestment of $1.13 per share in
  regular monthly dividends.(2)

  Life of Trust (1/29/99)                 5.66%
</Table>

  For federal income tax purposes, 99.99% of the total dividends paid by the
  Trust from net investment income during the year ended November 30, 2003, was
  designated as an exempt interest dividend.

- - Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 17.35% for the year
  ended November 30, 2003. That return was the result of an increase in net
  asset value per share from $13.02 on November 30, 2002, to $14.09 on November
  30, 2003, and the reinvestment of $1.13 per share in regular monthly
  dividends.

- - Based on the most recent dividend and a share price of $15.55, the Trust had a
  market yield of 7.65% at November 30, 2003.(3) The Trust's market yield is
  equivalent to a taxable yield of 11.77%.(4)

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - Insured* transportation bonds represented the Trust's largest sector weighting
  at November 30, 2003. The Trust's investments were well-diversified and
  included bonds for airports, turnpikes, and expressways.

- - The Trust's second largest sector concentration was in hospital bonds. In a
  competitive hospital environment, management emphasized institutions it
  believes are well-regarded and whose health care specialities and financial
  soundness give them a competitive advantage in their markets.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) constituted a major investment for the
  Trust and a representative geographical mix. Issuers included the state of
  California; Chicago, Illinois; and Jupiter, Florida. Insured* GOs are
  generally considered to provide a high-quality investment in a
  still-recovering economy.

- - Management continued to adjust coupon structure and upgrade call protection,
  as market conditions warranted. Coupon structure and call features can have a
  significant influence on the Trust's performance characteristics.

  THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND ARE
  CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON THE
  COVER. THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET OR
  OTHER CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH
  VIEWS. THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE
  INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR A FUND ARE BASED ON MANY FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED
  ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF OF ANY FUND.

    (1) It is not possible to invest directly in an Index.
    (2) A portion of the Trust's income may be subject to federal income tax
        and/or federal alternative minimum tax. Income may be subject to state
        tax.
    (3) The Trust's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent
        dividend per share by the share price at the end of the period and
        annualizing the result.
    (4) Taxable-equivalent yield assumes maximum 35.0% federal income tax rate.
        A lower rate would result in a lower taxable-equivalent figure.
    (5) Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
        change in share price or net asset value with all distributions
        reinvested. Performance results reflect the effect of leverage resulting
        from the Trust's issuance of Auction Preferred Shares.

    *   Private insurance does not remove the risk of loss of principal
        associated with insured investments due to changes in market conditions.

        Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return
        and market price will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth
        more or less than their original cost.

  SHARES OF THE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OTHER
  OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SHARES ARE
  SUBJECT TO INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL INVESTED.
  YIELDS WILL VARY.

The Trust invests primarily in debt securities issued by municipalities. The
ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their obligations may be
affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality. In
order to reduce the risk associated with such economic developments, at November
30, 2003, 33.8% of the securities in the portfolio of investments are backed by
bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial guaranty
assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by financial institutions
ranged from 3.6% to 15.3% of total investments.

(1) Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
    1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
    registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

(2) Security has been issued as a leveraged inverse floater bond.

(3) Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond.

(4) Non-income producing security.

(5) Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
    requirements on open financial futures contracts.

                       See notes to financial statements.

     assets applicable to common shares from 9.61% to 9.69% and increase the

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as
   a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
   Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.
   The Trust was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
   by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated December 10, 1998. The Trust's
   investment objective is to achieve current income exempt from regular federal
   income tax by investing primarily in investment grade municipal obligations.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Taxable obligations, if any, for
   which price quotations are readily available are normally valued at the mean
   between the latest bid and asked prices. Futures contracts listed on the
   commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Short-term
   obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
   which approximates value. Investments for which valuations or market
   quotations are unavailable are valued at fair value using methods determined
   in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

   B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

   D FEDERAL INCOME TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions
   of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and
   to distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, if any,
   and tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments.
   Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At
   November 30, 2003, the Trust, for federal income tax purposes, had a capital
   loss carryover of $31,928,458 which will reduce the taxable income arising
   from future net realized gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted
   by the Internal Revenue Code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions
   to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trust of
   any liability for federal income or excise tax. Such capital loss carryover
   will expire on November 30, 2007 ($9,497,591), November 30, 2008
   ($14,623,294), November 30, 2009 ($5,266,337), and November 30, 2011
   ($2,541,236). In addition, the Trust intends to satisfy conditions which will
   enable it to designate distributions from the interest income generated by
   its investments in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular
   federal income taxes when received by the Trust, as exempt-interest
   dividends. The portion of such interest, if any, earned on private activity
   bonds issued after August 7, 1986, may be considered a tax preference item
   for investors.

   E FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, the Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by the Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust. The Trust's
   investment in financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging
   against anticipated future changes in interest rates and investment purposes.
   Should interest rates move unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the
   anticipated benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a
   loss.

   F OPTIONS ON FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the purchase of a put option
   on a financial futures contract by the Trust, the premium paid is recorded as
   an investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
   option expires, the Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of
   the option. When the Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, the Trust
   will realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the
   closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option.
   When the Trust exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk
   associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium originally
   paid.

                                       12
<Page>

   G INTEREST RATE SWAPS -- The Trust has entered into interest rate swap
   agreements to enhance return, to hedge against fluctuations in securities
   prices or interest rates or as substitution for the purchase or sale of
   securities. Pursuant to these agreements, the Trust makes semi-annual
   payments at a fixed interest rate. In exchange, the Trust receives payments
   based on the interest rate of a benchmark industry index. During the term of
   the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value of the swap
   are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Payments received or made at the
   end of a measurement period are recorded as realized gains and losses. The
   value of the swap is determined by changes in the relationship between two
   rates of interest. The Trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of
   non-performance by the swap counterparty. However, the Trust does not
   anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. Risk may also arise from the
   unanticipated movements in value of interest rates.

   H USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   I EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balance the Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used to
   reduce the Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of total
   expenses in the Statement of Operations.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   The Trust issued 2,620 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,620
   shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on March 1, 1999 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as
   a reduction of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on the APS, which
   accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering
   of the APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction.
   Effective July 8, 2003, a special dividend period of 733 days was set on the
   series A shares. The dividend rate, which matures on July 12, 2005, is 1.25%.
   Dividend rates ranged from 0.69% to 1.50% for Series B Shares, during the
   year ended November 30, 2003. Series A and Series B are identical in all
   respects except for the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
   Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trust pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   The Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. Effective July 8, 2003, the Series A shares
   set a special dividend period of 733 days. The applicable dividend rate for
   the Auction Preferred Shares on November 30, 2003 was 1.25% and 1.05%, for
   Series A and Series B Shares, respectively. For the year ended November 30,
   2003, the Trust paid dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to
   $978,964 and $607,438 for Series A and Series B Shares, respectively,
   representing an average APS dividend rate for such period of 1.47% and 0.94%,
   respectively.

   The Trust distinguishes between distribution on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require

                                       13
<Page>

   that only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits be
   reported in the financial statements as a return of capital. Permanent
   differences between book and tax accounting relating to distributions are
   reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate primarily to the
   method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.70% of the
   Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for management and investment advisory services
   rendered to the Trust. Except for Trustees of the Trust who are not members
   of EVM's organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their
   services to the Trust out of such investment adviser fee. For the year ended
   November 30, 2003, the fee was equivalent to 0.70% of the Trust's average
   weekly gross assets and amounted to $2,500,095. EVM also serves as the
   administrator of the Trust. An administration fee, computed at the annual
   rate of 0.20% of the average weekly gross assets of the Trust, is paid to EVM
   for managing and administering business affairs of the Trust. For the year
   ended November 30, 2003, the administrative fee amounted to $714,313.

   Trustees of the Trust that are not affiliated with EVM may elect to defer
   receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in accordance with the
   terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For the year ended
   November 30, 2003, no significant amounts have been deferred.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of EVM.

5  INVESTMENTS

   Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. Government securities and
   short-term obligations, aggregated $104,377,933 and $110,528,839,
   respectively, for the year ended November 30, 2003.

6  FEDERAL INCOME TAX BASIS OF UNREALIZED APPRECIATION (DEPRECIATION)

   The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of the
   investments owned by the Trust at November 30, 2003, as computed for Federal
   income tax purposes, are as follows:

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and interest rate swaps and may involve, to a varying degree,
   elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement
   purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent
   the investment the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments
   and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk.
   The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful
   only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

                                       14

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust (the Trust), including the portfolio of
investments, as of November 30, 2003, and the related statement of operations
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
years in the four year period ended November 30, 2003 and for the period from
the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November 30, 1999. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities held as of November 30, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights, referred to
above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Municipal Income Trust as of November 30, 2003, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for the
respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC, Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.
