President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

Stock and bond markets around the globe this year have experienced one of their
most tumultuous periods in history. Investors have witnessed volatility of a
magnitude that many have never before seen. Distance often provides the best
vantage point for perspective. Still, we believe that the benefits of basic
investment principles that have stood the test of time -- even in the midst of
market turmoil -- cannot be underestimated.

First, invest for the long term. The founder of Pioneer Investments, Philip L.
Carret, began his investment career during the 1920s. One lesson he learned is
that while great prosperity affords an advantageous time for selling stocks,
extreme economic slumps can create opportunities for purchase. Indeed, many of
our portfolio managers, who follow the value-conscious investing approach of our
founder, are looking at recent market conditions as an opportunity to buy
companies whose shares we believe have been unjustifiably beaten down by
indiscriminate selling, but that we have identified as having strong prospects
over time. While investors may be facing a sustained market downturn, we
continue to believe that patience, along with staying invested in the market,
are important considerations for long-term investors.

A second principle is to stay diversified across different types of investments.
The global scope of the current market weakness poses challenges for this basic
investment axiom. But the turbulence makes now a good time to reassess your
portfolio and make sure that your investments continue to meet your needs. We
believe you should work closely with your financial advisor to find the mix of
stocks, bonds and money market assets that is best aligned to your particular
risk tolerance and investment objective.

As the investment markets sort through the continuing crisis in the financial
industry, we are staying focused on the fundamentals and risk management. With
more than 80 years of experience behind us, we have learned how to navigate
turbulent markets. At Pioneer Investments, risk management has always been a
critical part of our culture -- not just during periods of extraordinary
volatility. Our investment process is based on fundamental research,
quantitative analysis and active portfolio management. This three-pillared
process, which we apply to each of our portfolios, is supported by an integrated
team approach and is designed to carefully balance risk and reward. While we


2    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08
<PAGE>

see potential chances for making money in many corners of the market, it takes
research and experience to separate solid investment opportunities from
speculation.

We invite you to learn more about Pioneer and our time-tested approach to
investing by consulting with your financial advisor or visiting us online at
www.pioneerinvestments.com. Thank you for investing with Pioneer.


Respectfully,

/s/ Daniel K. Kingsbury

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/08

Senior Secured bank loans traded down during the 12 months ended November 30,
2008. Bank loan prices fell to historic lows during the final two months of the
period. This was driven by the continued negative influence from the credit
turmoil and the financial system as a whole. In the following interview,
portfolio managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of Highland Capital
Management discuss the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer Floating
Rate Trust during the 12 months ended November 30, 2008.

Q    How did the Trust perform during the 12 months ended November 30, 2008?

A    For the one-year period ended November 30, 2008, Pioneer Floating Rate
     Trust returned -44.40% at net asset value. The market price return over
     that same one-year period was -52.10%. The Trust's benchmark, the Credit
     Suisse ("CS") Leveraged Loan Index, returned -25.73% and the Barclays
     Capital (formerly Lehman Brothers) High Yield Loans Performing Index
     returned -27.09% for the same period. Neither index employed leverage as
     the Trust does. At the end of November 2008, the Trust was selling at a
     discount of market price to net asset value of -19.95%. Unlike open-ended
     funds, a closed-end fund's market price per share goes up and down based on
     supply and demand, irrespective of a fund's net asset value per share. It
     isn't unusual to find closed-end funds trading at a discount to the trust's
     net asset value. At the end of the period, closed-end funds on average were
     trading at a discount to their actual underlying value.

     The Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index is designed to mirror the investable
     universe of the $U.S.-denominated leveraged loan market. The index
     inception is January 1992. The index frequency is monthly. New loans are
     added to the index on their issuance date if they qualify according to the
     following criteria: Loans must be rated "5B" or lower; only funded term
     loans are included; the original maturity must be at least one year; and
     the Issuers must be domiciled in developed countries (Issuers from
     developing countries are excluded). (Source: Credit Suisse, Description and
     Inclusion Rules of the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index, January 18,
     2006). The Barclays Capital High Yield Bank Loan Performing Index provides
     broad and comprehensive total return metrics of the universe of syndicated
     term loans. To be included in the index, a bank loan must be dollar
     denominated, have at least $150 million funded loan, a minimum term of one
     year, and a minimum initial spread of LIBOR+125. Index returns are
     calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust
     returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. You cannot
     invest directly in an index.


4    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08
<PAGE>

     Index returns assume reinvestment of all dividends and distributions, if
     any. Indices are unmanaged, have no fees or costs and are not available for
     investment. The performance of the indices may be materially different from
     the individual performance attained by a specific investor. In addition,
     the investors' holdings may differ significantly from the securities that
     comprise the indices. The indices have not been selected to represent an
     appropriate benchmark to compare an investor's performance, but rather are
     disclosed to allow for comparison of the investor's performance to that of
     certain well-known and widely recognized indices.

Q    Can you explain the Trust's underperformance compared to the bank loan
     indices during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2008?

A    Underperformance during the period was driven in part by the Trust's use of
     leverage, a slightly lower average credit quality than the broad loan
     universe, a lack of liquidity in the marketplace, and the relatively poor
     performance of some of the Trust's media, real estate and automotive
     positions. The Pioneer Floating Rate Trust utilizes leverage, which tends
     to magnify returns, both positive and negative. The Trust's decline in net
     asset value resulted in a greater proportion of leveraged assets during the
     reporting period. We believe the use of leverage for investment purposes
     can increase investment opportunity and, as we saw over the last 12 months,
     can also increase investment risk. The Trust utilizes financial leverage
     primarily to increase the dividend yield to shareowners.

     The Trust invests in companies where management feels the underlying value
     is good relative to the interest received and the price offered. We do this
     in an effort to maximize total return over the long term, regardless of the
     impact on the Trust's weighted average ratings, which over the period were
     slightly lower than the Credit Suisse Index. In the prevailing credit and
     financial turmoil seen over the period, lower-rated positions have tended
     to trade down more than the overall market. As a point of reference, the BB
     (or higher) -rated subset of the Credit Suisse Index traded down from 95 to
     73, versus the B (or lower)-rated subset of the Credit Suisse Index, which
     traded down from 94 to 59 from November 2007 to November 2008. Finally, the
     Trust's performance was impacted by challenges presented in the media, real
     estate and automotive sectors, which dramatically impacted a few of the
     Trust's larger positions.

Q    What types of investments had the greatest influence on the Trust's
     performance during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2008?

A    As noted above, the Trust's performance was hurt in part by the troubles
     felt in the media, real estate and automotive markets. The troubles in
     these sectors have been well documented by the popular press since the
     credit crunch began in the summer of 2007. Media concerns have seen falling
     advertising revenues as companies dependent on consumers have been hurt


                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08     5
<PAGE>

     by a decrease in discretionary spending, which has led them to cut their
     advertising budgets. Media positions in the Trust that detracted from
     performance include Seven Media Group (SMG H5 P&Y, Ltd.), Tribune Co. and
     Univision Communication, Inc. Real estate and real estate-intensive
     holdings, including many of those in the Gaming and Leisure sector, have
     been impacted by the serious downturn in the domestic real estate market.
     Positions detracting from the Trust's performance include Metroflag BP LLC,
     Ginn LA Conduit Lender, Inc., Realogy Corp. and Lake at Las Vegas Joint
     Venture. Automotive companies have experienced an unprecedented drop in
     demand that has impacted the industry deeply enough to spur federal
     government bailout proposal talks during the fourth quarter of 2008.
     Automotive-related positions held in the Trust that detracted from
     performance during the period included Ford Motor Co. and Delphi Corp.

Q    What is your investment outlook?

A    The broader market is going through considerable turmoil, with
     consolidation and government intervention in major segments of the economy,
     including the financial and automotive sectors. Once the broader-market
     volatility subsides, we believe loan market performance will be driven more
     by fundamentals and less by technical supply/demand factors. While we do
     expect defaults to rise, we believe the fundamental strength of corporate
     borrowers remains greater than current price levels indicate, and that
     recent collateral and interest coverage levels suggest the corporate bank
     loan market is fundamentally solid. At these current depressed prices, we
     anticipate several long-term buying opportunities. We believe some degree
     of pricing support will come to the corporate bank loan market once
     confidence is restored in the global credit markets and as buyers re-enter.


Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 11-23 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained in the
Trust's original offering prospectus. Please refer to this document when
considering the Trust's risks.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Trust
will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices of
fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The floating-rate
feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not experience capital
appreciation in a declining interest-rate environment. Investments in the Trust
are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of
underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt obligations.


6    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08
<PAGE>

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the
Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more
difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares. The
Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt securities,
which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant risks, including
the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be sufficient
to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the return for the
holders of common shares.

The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher percentage
of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund. Being non-diversified
may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events affecting a particular
issuer.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends or
the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of the opinion of the Trust's sub-adviser as of the date of this
report. These statements should not be relied upon for any other purposes.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold
in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower
than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total liabilities,
which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common shares
outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher than market
price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CS Leveraged Loan Index is a
representative index of tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated
loans. The index began in January 1992. Index returns are calculated monthly,
assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any
fees, expenses or sales charges. You cannot invest directly in an index.

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/08

1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The investment objective
of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary objective of high current income.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments, including
second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities and high yield,
high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below investment grade
securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly referred to as "junk
bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to
pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve greater risk of loss,
are subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid, especially during
periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt securities.
The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default or that are in
bankruptcy.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities may
be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Trust believes
it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more volatile than
that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to
value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict
the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors
that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any
economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those
industries and sectors. Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is
contained in the Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional
information


                  Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08     29
<PAGE>

included in the Trust's shareowner reports from time to time. The Trust's
prospectus contains unaudited information regarding the Trust's principal risks.
Please refer to those documents when considering the Trust's risks.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.   Security Valuation

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Investments in Senior
     Loans are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of
     Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from
     one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation.
     For the limited number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes
     are available, such investments will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
     through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations.

     Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities ratings and liquidity. Valuations may be supplemented by values
     obtained from dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities are
     valued at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are
     traded. Securities or loans for which market prices and/or quotations are
     not readily available are valued using fair values methods pursuant to
     procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Trading in foreign securities
     is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of
     the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the net asset
     value of the Trust's shares are determined as of such times. The Trust may
     also use the fair value methods to value a security, including a non-U.S.
     security, when the closing market price on the principal exchange where the
     security is traded no longer reflects the value of the security. At
     November 30, 2008, there were no securities that were valued using fair
     value methods (other than securities valued using prices supplied by
     independent pricing services). Temporary cash investments are valued at
     cost which approximates market value.


30    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08
<PAGE>

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. All discounts and premiums on
     debt securities are accreted or amortized, respectively, daily, on an
     effective yield to maturity basis and are included in interest income.
     Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash accounts, is
     recorded on an accrual basis.

     Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
     cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
     among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
     contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between the
     amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received. Further,
     the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments
     are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of
     changes in market prices of those securities but are included with the net
     realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

     The Trust enters into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
     the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
     future date as a hedge or cross-hedge against either specific investment
     transactions (settlement hedges) or portfolio positions (portfolio hedges).
     All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable exchange rates,
     and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the Trust's
     financial statements. The Trust records realized gains and losses at the
     time a portfolio hedge is offset by entry into a closing transaction or
     extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering
     into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
     the terms of the contract and from unanticipated movements in the value of
     foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 3).

D.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
     shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. All
     tax returns filed thus far are subject to examination by tax authorities.

     The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
     financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
     income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may be
     shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess
     of net investment income or net realized gain (loss) on investment
     transactions, or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax
     differences that may exist.

     At November 30, 2008, the Trust reclassified $3,010,583 to decrease
     undistributed net investment income and decrease net realized loss on
     investments to reflect permanent book/tax differences. The reclassification
     has no impact on the net asset value of the Trust and presents the Trust's
     capital accounts on a tax basis.

     The Trust has elected to defer $13,026,562 in capital losses and $152,883
     in currency losses realized between November 1, 2008 and November 30, 2008
     to its fiscal year ending November 30, 2009.

     At November 30, 2008, the Trust had a capital loss carryforward of
     $27,976,876 which will expire in 2016, if not utilized.

     The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and
     preferred shareowners during the years ended November 30, 2008 and November
     30, 2007 were as follows:

<PAGE>

     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
     methods for premiums and discounts on fixed-income securities and book/ tax
     differences in the accrual of income on securities in default.

E.   Repurchase Agreements

     With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
     of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
     received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
     excess of the value of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase.
     The collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the
     customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or sub custodians. The
     Trust's investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM"), is
     responsible for determining that the value of the collateral remains at
     least equal to the repurchase price.

F.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
     Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
     dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
     full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners
     may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not participating in
     the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
     Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
     resumed at any time without penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer &
     Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the
     "Plan Agent"), in writing prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
     termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any
     subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
     acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional
     unissued but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
     outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
     on the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share
     is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
     brokerage trading fees ("market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the
     dividend amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued
     common shares to be credited to each account will be determined by dividing
     the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per common share
     on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from
     the then current market price per share on the date of issuance does not
     exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value
     per


                  Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08     33
<PAGE>

     common share is greater than the market value ("market discount"), the Plan
     Agent will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in
     open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly
     issued common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share
     of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
     open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
     shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
     dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
     brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to another broker
     and continue to participate in the Plan.


2.   Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. ("UniCredit")
manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's
Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily
value of the Trust's total assets minus the sum of the Trust's liabilities,
which liabilities exclude debt related to leverage, short-term debt and the
aggregate liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred shares. For the
year ended November 30, 2008, the net management fee was equivalent to 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.15% of the
Trust's average daily net assets attributable to the common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At November 30,
2008, $302,344 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative
cost and certain other services and is included in "Due to affiliates" on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

PIM has retained Princeton Administrators, LLC ("Princeton") to provide certain
administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. PIM pays
Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the average daily value of
the Trust's managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily
managed assets in excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of
$10,000. Princeton receives no compensation directly from the Trust.

PIM has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments
through December 31, 2008. PIM pays the Sub-adviser a monthly fee at an annual
rate of 0.35% of the average daily value of the Trust managed assets. The fee is
paid monthly in arrears. The Trust does not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

Also, PIM had agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations (December 23, 2004 - December 23, 2007) to limit the Trust's total
annual expenses excluding offering costs for common and preferred shares,


34    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08
<PAGE>

interest expense, the cost of defending or prosecuting any claim or litigation
to which the Trust is a party (together with any amount in judgment or
settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes incurred due to the failure of
the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code or any
other non-recurring or non-operating expenses, to 0.95% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets. The dividend on any preferred shares was not an expense
for this purpose. For the year ended November 30, 2008 the Trust's expenses were
not reduced under such arrangements. As of December 23, 2007, this expense
limitation is no longer in effect.

3.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver currencies
at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust must make or
take delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the settlement
date of a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by entering
into an offsetting hedge contract. At November 30, 2008, the Trust had no
outstanding portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

4.   Unfunded Loan Commitments

As of November 30, 2008, the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of $3,579,123
which could be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to the following
loan agreements:

5.   Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. ("PIMSS"), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all
transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at
negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank") is the
transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with respect
to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). The Trust pays Deutsche
Bank an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and Deutsche
Bank, for providing such services.

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As
of November 30, 2008 there were 8,179 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,729, Series
W7-2,725 and Series TH7-2,725.

On November 5, 2008, the Trust announced the following redemptions of AMPS at a
price of $25,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends through the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The Trust financed the AMPS redemptions with cash.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An auction fails
if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers. When an auction
fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate on the auction
dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred shareowners will not
be able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction fails. Since February
2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The maximum rate for
each series is the greater of 125% of the one week LIBOR rate or the LIBOR rate
plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS ranged from 2.09% to 6.10% during
the year ended November 30, 2008.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or


36    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08
<PAGE>

unpaid dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to
mandatory redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the
composition of the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred
shares and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including,
among other things, changes in the Trust's sub classification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

7.   Short Positions

At November 30, 2008, the Trust inadvertently held two short positions in
Realogy. A short position occurs when a fund sells securities that it does not
own. On December 30, 2008, the Trust closed out its short position and was
reimbursed $396,422 by the adviser for losses incurred to date.

8.   New Pronouncement

In March 2008, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 161"), was issued and
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161
requires enhanced disclosures about an entity's derivative and hedging
activities. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS
161 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

9.   Subsequent Events

Subsequent to November 30, 2008, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.115 per common share
payable December 19, 2008 to common shareowners of record on December 12, 2008.

Effective January 1, 2009, PIM assumed sole responsibility for management of the
Trust's investments.

Payment of the November 2008 distribution was postponed on November 26, 2008 due
to market volatility and declines in the market prices of securities in which
the Trust invests, causing the Trust's assets to fall below asset coverage
requirements relating the Trust's AMPS that are pre-conditions to the payment of


                  Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08     37
<PAGE>

common share distributions. On December 4, 2008, the Trust announced it would
pay its previously declared November 2008 distribution of $0.115 per common
shareowner on December 9, 2008. The November 2008 distribution was paid to
common shareowners of record as of November 14, 2008.

Subsequent to November 30, 2008, dividends declared and paid on preferred shares
totaled $351,893 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share series
through January 9, 2009.

On December 8, 2008, the Trust announced the following redemptions of AMPS at a
price of $25,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends through the
redemption date:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareowners of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2008, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of November 30, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian,
selling or agent banks and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures
where replies from selling or agent banks or brokers were not received. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust at November 30, 2008, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM") serves as the Trusts's investment
adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust.
The Trustees of the Trust, as required by law, determine annually whether to
continue the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

At a meeting held on November 11, 2008, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by PIM, the Trustees of the Trust, including the
independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the continuation of
the investment advisory agreement with PIM for another year. At that meeting,
the Trustees also determined not to renew the sub-advisory agreement with
Highland Capital Management, L.P. that had been in effect for the Trust. In
considering the continuation of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees
considered various factors that they determined were relevant, including the
factors described below. The Trustees did not identify any single factor as the
controlling factor in determining to approve the continuation of the investment
advisory agreement.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services
The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
provided by PIM to the Trust and that would be provided by PIM to the Trust upon
the termination of the sub-advisory agreement, taking into account the
investment objective and strategy of the Trust and the information related to
the Trust provided to the Trustees at each quarterly meeting. The Trustees
reviewed the terms of the investment advisory agreement. The Trustees also
reviewed PIM's investment approach for the Trust and its research process. The
Trustees considered the resources of PIM and the personnel of PIM who would
provide investment management services to the Trust. They also considered PIM's
compliance and legal resources and personnel.

The Trustees also considered that, as administrator, PIM is responsible for the
administration of the Trust's business and other affairs. It was noted that PIM
supervises and monitors the performance of the Trust's service providers and
provides the Trust with personnel (including officers) as are necessary for the
Trust's operations. The Trustees considered the fees paid to PIM for the
provision of such services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had provided by PIM to the Trust and that would be
provided by PIM to the Trust upon the termination of the sub-advisory agreement
were satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory
agreement.

Performance of the Trust
The Trustees considered the performance results of the Trust over various time
periods. They reviewed information comparing the Trust's performance with the
average performance of its peer group of funds as classified by Morningstar,
Inc. ("Morningstar"), an independent provider of investment company data, and
with the performance of the Trust's benchmark index. The Trustees considered
that the Trust's annualized total return was in the fourth quintile of its
Morningstar category for the one year period ended June 30, 2008 and in the
first quintile of its Morningstar category for the three year period ending June
30, 2008. (In all quintile rankings referred to throughout this disclosure,
first quintile is most favorable to the Trust's shareowners. Thus, highest
relative performance would be first quintile and lowest relative expenses would
also be first quintile.) The Trustees noted that the yield (gross of expenses)
to the Trust's common shareowners for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008
exceeded the yield of the Trust's benchmark index for the same period. Because
the Trustees determined not to renew the sub-advisory agreement that had been in
effect for the Trust, they also considered the performance of another fund
managed by PIM with similar investment objectives and strategies as the Trust.
The Trustees noted that the other fund managed by PIM with similar investment
objectives and strategies as the Trust did not employ leverage and the impact
that the Trust's leverage had on the Trust's performance results. Given that,
under the investment advisory agreement, PIM would be making the day-to-day
investment decisions for the Trust upon the termination of the sub-advisory
agreement, the Trustees concluded that the investment performance of the other
fund managed by PIM with similar investment objectives and strategies as the
Trust supported the renewal of the investment advisory agreement.

Management Fee and Expenses
The Trustees considered information on the fees and expenses of the Trust in
comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC ("Strategic Insight"), an independent third party.

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2008 was in the second quintile relative to the management fees
paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight peer group for the comparable
period. The Trustees also considered that the Trust's expense ratio for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2008 was in the fourth quintile relative to its
Strategic Insight peer group for the comparable period. It was noted that PIM
did not currently manage any separate accounts with an investment objective and
strategies that were similar to the Trust.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to PIM was
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services that had


                  Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Annual Report | 11/30/08     43
<PAGE>

been provided by PIM and that would be provided by PIM upon the termination of
the sub-advisory agreement, taking into account the fees charged by other
advisers for managing comparable funds with similar strategies. The Trustees
also concluded that the Trust's expense ratio was reasonable, taking into
account the size of the Trust, the quality of services provided and to be
provided by PIM and the investment performance of the Trust.

Profitability
The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They noted that PIM's profit
margin with respect to the Trust would change after giving effect to the
termination of the sub-advisory agreement. They further reviewed the financial
results realized by PIM and its affiliates from non-fund businesses. The
Trustees considered PIM's profit margins with respect to the Trust in comparison
to the limited industry data available and noted that the profitability of any
adviser was affected by numerous factors, including its organizational structure
and method for allocating expenses. The Trustees recognized that PIM should be
entitled to earn a reasonable level of profit for the services provided to the
Trust. The Trustees concluded that PIM's profitability with respect to the
management of the Trust was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale
The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is a
closed-end fund and its size is relatively stable at an asset level that was
anticipated when the management fee was initially set, the Trustees concluded
that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration.

Other Benefits
The Trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the Trust,
other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services provided by PIM
and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the revenues and
profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business. The Trustees
also considered the intangible benefits to PIM by virtue of its relationship
with the Trust and the other Pioneer funds. The Trustees concluded that the
receipt of these benefits was reasonable in the context of the overall
relationship between PIM and the Trust.

Conclusion
After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors, the
Trustees, including all of the independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, was fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
continuation of the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after
May 6, 2003, the effective date of the new SEC pre-approval rules, the
Fund's audit committee is required to pre-approve services to affiliates
defined by SEC rules to the extent that the services are determined to
have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting of the
Fund.  For the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, there were
no services provided to an affiliate that required the Fund's audit
committee pre-approval.

(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.


The aggregate non-audit fees for the Fund and affiliates, as previously
defined, totaled approximately $17,940 in 2008 and $17,105 in 2007.

(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
Affiliates (as defined) that were not pre- approved pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,
identify each committee member. If the entire board of directors
is acting as the registrants audit committee as specified in
Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(B)),
so state.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit
committe eestablished in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3(d)) regarding an exemption
from the listing standards for audit committees.

N/A

Item 6. Schedule of Investments.

File Schedule I Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers
as of the close of the reporting period as set forth in 210.12-
12 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12], unless the schedule is
included as part of the report to shareholders filed under Item
1 of this Form.

Included in Item 1


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A closed-end management investment company that is filing an annual report on
this Form N-CSR must, unless it invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that the
company uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of its
shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the company's investment adviser;
principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

		    Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

                                       10
<PAGE>

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11
<PAGE>

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

</TABLE>

Potential Conflicts of Interest. When a portfolio manager is responsible for the
management of more than one account, the potential arises for the portfolio
manager to favor one account over another. The principal types of potential
conflicts of interest that may arise are discussed below. For the reasons
outlined below, Pioneer does not believe that any material conflicts are likely
to arise out of a portfolio manager's responsibility for the management of the
fund as well as one or more other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted
procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to detect and prevent
violations of the federal securities laws and to mitigate the potential for
conflicts of interest to affect its portfolio management decisions, there can be
no assurance that all conflicts will be identified or that all procedures will
be effective in mitigating the potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of
such conflicts of interest are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager
has a financial incentive to favor one account over another. Pioneer has
structured its compensation arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit
such potential for conflicts of interest. The fund's investment subadviser also
has adopted certain compliance procedures which are designed to address these
types of conflicts. However, there is no guarantee that such procedures will
detect each situation in which a conflict might arise. See "Compensation of
Portfolio Managers" below.

o       A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in  allocating
        new investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial
        public offerings and private placements. If, for example, an initial
        public offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly
        shortly after the offering was allocated to a single account, that
        account may be expected to have better investment performance than other
        accounts that did not receive an allocation of the initial public
        offering. Generally, investments for which there is limited availability
        are allocated based upon a range of factors including available cash and
        consistency with the accounts' investment objectives and policies. This
        allocation methodology necessarily involves some ubjective elements but
        is intended over time to treat each client in an equitable and fair
        manner. Generally, the investment opportunity is allocated among
        participating accounts on a pro rata basis. Although Pioneer believes
        that its practices are reasonably  designed to treat each client in an
        equitable and fair manner, there may be instances where a fund may not
        participate, or may participate to a lesser degree than other clients,
        in the allocation of an investment opportunity.

o       A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order in
        which trades for the accounts are placed. If a portfolio manager
        determines to purchase a security for more than one account in an
        aggregate amount that may influence the market price of the security,
        accounts that purchased or sold the security first may receive a more
        favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions. The
        less liquid the market for the security or the greater the percentage
        that the proposed aggregate purchases or sales represent of average
        daily trading volume, the greater the potential for accounts that
        make subsequent purchases or sales to receive a less favorable price.
        When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same security on the same
        day for more than one account, the trades typically are "bunched," which
        means that the trades for the individual accounts are aggregated and
        each account receives the same price. There are some types of accounts
        as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons (such
        as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise where
        the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the best
        possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
        Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as
        favorable a price as possible for such client.

o       A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
        compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater
        degree than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager. If, for
        example, the portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the
        performance of certain accounts relative to a benchmark while other
        accounts are disregarded for this purpose, the portfolio manager will
        have a financial incentive to seek to have the accounts that determine
        the portfolio manager's bonus achieve the best possible performance to
        the possible detriment of other accounts. Similarly, if Pioneer receives
        a performance-based advisory fee, the portfolio manager may favor that
        account, whether or not the performance of that account directly
        determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o       A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has
        a beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client
        or to compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the
        portfolio manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was
        one of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio
        manager would have an economic incentive to favor the account in which
        the portfolio manager held an interest.

o       If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
        investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise.
        For example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one account
        and sells the same security for another account, such trading pattern
        may disadvantage either the account that is long or short. In making
        portfolio manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid such potentially
        conflicting situations. However, where a portfolio manager is
        responsible for accounts with differing investment objectives and
        policies, it is possible that the portfolio manager will conclude that
        it is in the best interest of one account to sell a portfolio security
        while another account continues to hold or increase the holding in such
        security.

Compensation of Portfolio Managers. Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation
for portfolio managers that seeks to align the financial interests of the
portfolio managers with those of shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer
funds) the portfolio managers manage, as well as with the financial performance
of Pioneer. The compensation program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes
a base salary (determined by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual
bonus program, as well as customary benefits that are offered generally to all
full-time employees. Base compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an
annual basis. Pioneer seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking
into account the experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The
bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment
performance and align the interests of the investment professional with those of
shareholders, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus
under the plan is completely discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may
be in excess of base salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the
following factors:

o        Quantitative Investment Performance. The quantitative investment
         performance calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of
         all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes
         the fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over
         a one-year period (20% weighting) and four-year period (80% weighting),
         measured for periods ending on December 31. The accounts, which include
         the fund, are ranked against a group of mutual funds with similar
         investment objectives and investment focus (60%) and a broad-based
         securities market index measuring the performance of the same type of
         securities in which the accounts invest (40%), which, in the case of
         the fund, is the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index. As a result of these two
         benchmarks, the performance of the portfolio manager for compensation
         purposes is measured against the criteria that are relevant to the
         portfolio manager's competitive universe.
o        Qualitative Performance. The qualitative performance component with
         respect to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager
         includes objectives, such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork,
         leadership, communications and marketing, that are mutually established
         and evaluated by each portfolio manager and management.
o        Pioneer Results and Business Line Results. Pioneer's financial
         performance, as well as the investment performance of its investment
         management group, affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a
         leverage factor of plus or minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers may participate in other programs designed to reward
and retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees may be
granted performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredit and
the financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., which are
affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

Share Ownership by Portfolio Manager. The following table indicates as of
November 30, 2008 the value, within the indicated range, of shares beneficially
owned by the portfolio manager of the fund.

Item 9. Purchases of Equity Securities by Closed-End Management
Investment Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrants equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781). Instruction to paragraph (a). Disclose
all purchases covered by this Item, including purchases that do not
satisfy the conditions of the safe harbor of Rule 10b-18 under the
Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18), made in the period covered by the
report. Provide disclosures covering repurchases made on a monthly basis.
For example, if the reporting period began on January 16 and ended on
July 15, the chart would show repurchases for the months from January 16
through February 15, February 16 through March 15, March 16 through
April 15, April 16 through May 15, May 16 through June 15, and June 16
through July 15.

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.


Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrants board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G)
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrants board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14(A) in
its definitive proxy statement, or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive officer or
officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing
similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The Principal Executive and Financial Officers concluded
that the Registrant's Disclosure Controls and Procedures are
effective based on the evaluation of the Disclosure Controls
and Procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing date
of this report.

During the filing period of the report, fund management
identified a significant deficiency relating to the execution
of an existing control relating to the sub-adviser's review of
portfolio holdings. This deficiency did not materially
impact the accuracy of the fund's financial statements
attached in Item 1. There was no material impact to the
shareholders and fund management discussed this matter
with the Registrant's Audit Committee and auditors. The
control structure has been altered as disclosed in Item 11(b)
below.


(b) Disclose whether or not there were significant changes in the registrant's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

There have been no significant changes in the Registrant's
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
Registrant's second fiscal quarter covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.

As referenced above, on November 11, 2008, the Board of
Trustees determined not to continue the investment sub-
advisory agreement with the sub-adviser.  The sub-advisory
agreement terminated in accordance with its terms on
December 31, 2008. On January 1, 2009, the Registrant's
investment adviser assumed full responsibility for the day-
to-day investment management of the Registrant and
therefore the former sub-adviser's controls no longer affect
the Registrant's internal controls over financial reporting.


The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit.



(b) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2 under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2).

Filed herewith.
