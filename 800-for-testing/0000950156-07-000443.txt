LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders,

The past year has been a great example of why investors should keep their eyes
on the long term.

In 2006 the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 19%. As of mid-May 2007, it
had returned another 8% and continued to reach new highs. But the Dow's upward
rise has not been without hiccups. After hitting new records in February, the
Dow lost 5.8% between February 20 and March 5, as stocks were sold off around
the globe. As we have said before, markets are volatile, and investors should
make sure they have an investment plan that can carry them through the peaks
and troughs.

If you are focused on a long-term investment strategy, the short-term ups and
downs of the markets should not necessarily dictate portfolio action on your
part. Both the bond and stock markets are cyclical. In our view, investors who
remain committed to a long-term plan are more likely to achieve their financial
goals. We believe you should not let the headlines guide you in your investment
decisions and should be cautious about overreacting to short-term volatility.

In any market environment, we believe individual investors are best served by
following a three-pronged investment strategy of allocating their holdings
across the major asset classes, diversifying within each class, and regularly
rebalancing their portfolios to maintain their desired allocations. Of course,
these strategies cannot guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. Investing
and planning for the long term require diligence and patience, two traits that
in our experience are essential to capitalizing on the many opportunities the
financial markets can offer -- through both up and down economic cycles.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

    June 15, 2007

              Average Credit Quality of Rated
              Securities (short-term) (a)                  A-1
              ------------------------------------------------

(a) The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
    weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
    agencies.
(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price is likely to fluctuate
    with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond
    with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(i) For purposes of this presentation, the bond component includes both accrued
    interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any derivative holdings,
    if applicable.
(m) The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
    the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which
    have been pre- refunded or pre-paid to an earlier date or which have a
    mandatory put date prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown
    takes into account these earlier dates.
(o) Less than 0.1%
(r) Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
    rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
    Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based
    on the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a
    security which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is
    considered Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency
    mortgage-backed securities, if any, are included in the "AAA"-rating
    category. Percentages are based on the total market value of investments as
    of 04/30/07.

From time to time "Cash & Other Assets" may be negative due to timing of cash
receipts and/or equivalent exposure from any derivative holdings.

Percentages are based on net assets, including preferred shares, as of
04/30/07, unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed and current holdings may be different.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index - a market-value-weighted index
representative of the tax-exempt bond market.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. The trust's shares also may trade at a premium to their net asset
value.

When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset value
underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive less
than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As a
result, the total returns that are calculated based on the net asset value and
New York Stock Exchange prices can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes
as a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her
shares and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be
treated as gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of
shareholder capital have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and may
increase the trust's expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.


In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate. There is no
service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage charges for
shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are bought on the
New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each participant pays
a pro rata share of the transaction expenses, including commissions. The
automatic reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

Effective May 1, 2007, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the Transfer Agent
for the trust) became the agent for the plan.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the trust) is a trust that is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end diversified management
investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest up to 100% of its portfolio in high-yield securities rated below
investment grade. Investments in high-yield securities involve greater degrees
of credit and market risk than investments in higher-rated securities and tend
to be more sensitive to economic conditions. Municipal securities backed by
current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can
be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the
projects or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from
the assets. If the Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal
security has not complied with applicable tax requirements, the security could
decline in value, interest from the security could become taxable and the trust
may be required to issue Forms 1099-DIV.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated or
composite bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Short-term
instruments with a maturity at issuance of 60 days or less may be valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value. Swaps are generally valued at
an evaluated bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Securities and
other assets generally valued on the basis of information from an independent
pricing service may also be valued at a broker-dealer bid quotation. Values
obtained from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and
electronic data processing techniques, which take into account factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics, and other market
data.

The Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility for determining or
causing to be determined the value of the trust's investments (including any
fair valuation) to the adviser pursuant to valuation policies and procedures
approved by the Board. If the adviser determines that reliable market
quotations are not readily available, investments are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with such procedures
under the oversight of the Board of Trustees. Under the trust's valuation
policies and procedures, market quotations are not considered to be readily
available for many types of debt instruments and certain types of derivatives.
These investments are generally valued at fair value based on information from
independent pricing services. In addition, investments may be valued at fair
value if the adviser determines that an investment's value has been materially
affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on which
the investment is principally traded (such as foreign exchange or market) and
prior to the determination of the trust's net asset value, or after the halting
of trading of a specific security where trading does not resume prior to the
close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded.
Events that occur on a frequent basis after foreign markets close (such as
developments in foreign markets and significant movements in the U.S. markets)
and prior to the determination of the trust's net asset value may be deemed to
have a material affect on the value of securities traded in foreign markets.
Accordingly, the trust's foreign securities may often be valued at fair value.
The adviser may rely on independent pricing services or other information (such
as the correlation with price movements of similar securities in the same or
other markets; the type, cost and investment characteristics of the security;
the business and financial condition of the issuer; and trading and other
market data) to assist in determining whether to fair value and at what value
to fair value an investment. The value of an investment for purposes of
calculating the trust's net asset value can differ depending on the source and
method used to determine value. When fair valuation is used, the value of
investments used to determine the trust's net asset value may differ from
quoted or published prices for the same investments.

In September 2006, FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (the
"Statement") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 and for all interim periods within those fiscal years. This
Statement provides a single definition of fair value, a hierarchy for measuring
fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. Management
is evaluating the application of the Statement to the trust, and believes the
impact will be limited to expanded disclosures resulting from the adoption of
this Statement in the trust's financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 159 (FAS 159) "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities - including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115." FAS 159
permits entities to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
option has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent
reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007. Management is evaluating the application of the Statement to the
trust and its impact on the trust's financial statements, if any, has not been
determined.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The trust may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-
hedging purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains. When the trust uses derivatives as an investment to
gain market exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from derivative
instruments may be substantially greater than the derivative's original cost.
Derivative instruments include swap agreements and inverse floaters.

SWAP AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the trust and another party. Net cash
payments are exchanged at specified intervals and are recorded as a realized
gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. The value of the swap is adjusted
daily and the change in value, including accruals of periodic amounts of
interest to be paid or received, is recorded as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation in the Statement of Operations. A liquidation payment received or
made upon early termination is recorded as a realized gain or loss in the
Statement of Operations. Collateral, in the form of cash or securities, may be
required to be held in segregated accounts with the trust's custodian in
connection with these agreements. Risk of loss may exceed amounts recognized on
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. These risks include the possible lack
of a liquid market, failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of
the agreements, and unfavorable market movement of the underlying instrument.
All swap agreements entered into by the trust with the same counterparty are
generally governed by a single master agreement, which provides for the netting
of all amounts owed by the parties under the agreement upon the occurrence of
an event of default, thereby reducing the credit risk to which such party is
exposed. The trust holds interest rate swap agreements which involve the
periodic exchange of cash flows, such as the exchange of fixed rate interest
payments for floating rate interest payments based on a notional principal
amount. The interest rates may be based on a specific financial index or the
exchange of two distinct floating rate payments. The trust may enter into an
interest rate swap in order to manage its exposure to interest rate
fluctuations.

INVERSE FLOATERS - The trust invests in municipal inverse floating rate
securities which are structured by the issuer (known as primary market inverse
floating rate securities) or by an investment banker utilizing municipal bonds
which have already been issued (known as secondary market inverse floating rate
securities) to have variable rates of interest which typically move in the
opposite direction of short term interest rates. A secondary market inverse
floating rate security is created when an investment banker transfers a fixed
rate municipal bond to a special purpose trust, and causes the trust to (a)
issue floating rate certificates to third parties, in an amount equal to a
fraction of the par amount of the deposited bonds (these certificates usually
pay tax-exempt interest at short-term interest rates that typically reset
weekly; and the certificate holders typically, on seven days notice, have the
option to tender their certificates to the investment banker or another party
for redemption at par plus accrued interest), and (b) issue inverse floating
rate certificates (sometimes referred to as "inverse floaters"). If the holder
of the inverse floater transfers the municipal bonds to an investment banker
for the purpose of depositing the municipal bonds into the special purpose
trust, the inverse floating rate certificates that are issued by the trust are
referred to as "self-deposited inverse floaters." If the bonds held by the
trust are purchased by the investment banker for deposit into the trust from
someone other than the purchasers of the inverse floaters, the inverse floating
rate certificates that are issued by the trust are referred to as "externally
deposited inverse floaters." Such self-deposited inverse floaters held by the
fund are accounted for as secured borrowings, with the municipal bonds
reflected in the investments of the fund and amounts owed to the holder of the
floating rate certificate under the provisions of the trust, which amounts are
paid solely from the assets of the trust, reflected as liabilities of the fund
in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities under the caption, "Payable to the
holder of the floating rate certificate from trust assets". At April 30, 2007,
the trust's payable to the holder of the floating rate certificate from trust
assets was $5,369,322. The weighted average interest rate on the floating rate
certificates issued by the trust was 3.93%. Interest expense and fees relate to
payments made to the holder of the floating rate certificate from trust assets
in connection with self-deposited inverse floater transactions. Interest
expense and fees are recorded as incurred. For the six months ended April 30,
2007, interest expense and fees in connection with self-deposited inverse
floaters was $119,456. Primary and externally deposited inverse floaters held
by the trust are not accounted for as secured borrowings.

INDEMNIFICATIONS - Under the trust's organizational documents, its officers and
trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to the trust. Additionally, in the
normal course of business, the trust enters into agreements with service
providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The trust's maximum
exposure under these agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims
that may be made against the trust that have not yet occurred.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All premium and
original issue discount is amortized or accreted for tax reporting purposes as
required by federal income tax regulations. The trust may receive proceeds from
litigation settlements. Any proceeds received from litigation involving
portfolio holdings are reflected in the Statement of Operations in realized
gain/loss if the security has been disposed of by the fund or in unrealized
gain/loss if the security is still held by the trust. Any other proceeds from
litigation not related to portfolio holdings are reflected as other income in
the Statement of Operations. Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to
preserve and protect the value of a security owned are added to the cost of the
security; other legal fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the
security issuer, which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or
enhance the value of high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to
the cost basis of the security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms
or conditions of capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of
reorganization are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to
protect or enhance an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or
legal actions, are expensed.

As a result of the change in estimate for the amortization of premium and
accretion of discount on certain debt securities, interest income has been
increased by $1,361,696, with a corresponding reduction to net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation).

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the six months ended April 30, 2007, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust intends to qualify as a regulated
investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code,
and to distribute all of its taxable and tax-exempt income, including realized
capital gains. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is required in
the financial statements.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are
periodically adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax
character. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value
per share. Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain items of
income, expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and
tax purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess
of net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions
for financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and tax
purposes.

Book/tax differences primarily relate to amortization and accretion of
debt securities.

The tax character of distributions made during the current period will be
determined at fiscal year end.

The tax character of distributions declared to shareholders is as follows:

                                                            10/31/06

          Ordinary income (including any short-term
          capital gains)                                    $181,879
          Tax-exempt income                               24,170,453

In June 2006, FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes (the "Interpretation") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as
of the effective date. On December 22, 2006, the SEC delayed the implementation
of the Interpretation for regulated investment companies for an additional six
months. This Interpretation prescribes a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return, and requires certain expanded disclosures. Management
has evaluated the application of the Interpretation to the trust, and has
determined that there is no impact resulting from the adoption of this
Interpretation on the trust's financial statements.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
management and related administrative services and facilities to the trust. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the trust's average weekly net assets (including the value of the auction
preferred shares) and 6.32% of gross income. Gross income is calculated based
on tax rules that generally include the amortization of premium and exclude the
accretion of market discount, which may differ from investment income reported
in the Statement of Operations. The management fee, from net assets and gross
income, incurred for the six months ended April 30, 2007 was equivalent to an
annual effective rate of 0.77% of the trust's average daily net assets,
including preferred shares.

TRANSFER AGENT - Prior to December 18, 2006, MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS, received a fee from the trust for its services
as registrar and dividend-disbursing agent. Pursuant to a written agreement,
the trust paid MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a
dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. Effective December 18, 2006,
the trust has engaged Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") as
the sole transfer agent for the trust. MFSC will continue to monitor and
supervise the activities of Computershare for an agreed upon fee approved by
the Board of Trustees. For the six months ended April 30, 2007, these fees paid
to MFSC amounted to $17,828. MFSC also receives payment from the trust for
out-of-pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the trust. For the six months
ended April 30, 2007, these costs amounted to $23,333.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to the trust.
Under an administrative services agreement, the trust partially reimburses MFS
the costs incurred to provide these services. The trust is charged a fixed
amount plus a fee based on calendar year average net assets. The trust's annual
fixed amount is $17,500. The administrative services fee incurred for the six
months ended April 30, 2007 was equivalent to an annual effective rate of
0.0194% of the trust's average daily net assets.

TRUSTEES' AND OFFICERS' COMPENSATION - The trust pays compensation to
independent trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional
compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The trust does not pay
compensation directly to trustees or to officers of the trust who are also
officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers and trustees of the trust are
officers or directors of MFS and MFSC. The trust has an unfunded, defined
benefit plan for certain retired independent trustees which resulted in a
pension expense of $3,467. This amount is included in independent trustees'
compensation for the six months ended April 30, 2007. The liability for
deferred retirement benefits payable to certain retired independent trustees
amounted to $111,367 at April 30, 2007, and is included in payable for
independent trustees' compensation.

OTHER - This trust and certain other MFS funds (the funds) have entered into a
services agreement (the Agreement) which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement. For the six months ended April 30, 2007, the fee paid to Tarantino
LLC was $1,248. MFS has agreed to reimburse the trust for a portion of the
payments made by the funds to Tarantino LLC in the amount of $808, which is
shown as a reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.
Additionally, MFS has agreed to bear all expenses associated with office space,
other administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO.

Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. government securities,
purchased option transactions, and short-term obligations, aggregated
$33,647,120 and $34,955,330 respectively.

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The trust's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest. During the six months ended April 30, 2007, the trust
did not repurchase any shares. Transactions in trust shares were as follows:

                                    SIX MONTHS ENDED          YEAR ENDED
                                        4/30/07                10/31/06
                                  SHARES      AMOUNT     SHARES        AMOUNT
  Shares issued to
  shareholders in reinvestment
  of distributions                101,564    $822,150    179,319     $1,428,897

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other funds managed by MFS participate in a $1 billion unsecured
committed line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a credit
agreement. In addition, the trust and other funds managed by MFS have
established uncommitted borrowing arrangements with certain banks. Borrowings
may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to each fund,
based on its borrowings, generally at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds
rate plus 0.30% for the committed line of credit and 0.35% for the uncommitted
line of credit. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average daily,
unused portion of the committed line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. For the six months
ended April 30, 2007, the trust's commitment fee and interest expense on the
line of credit were $847 and $921, respectively, and are included in
miscellaneous expense and interest expense and fees, respectively, on the
Statement of Operations.

(7) AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The trust issued 2,800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"), series T and
2,800 of Auction Preferred Shares, series TH. Dividends are cumulative at a
rate that is reset every seven days for both series through an auction process.
During the six months ended April 30, 2007, the dividend rates ranged from
2.89% to 4.35%. The trust pays an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the
preferred share liquidation value for remarketing efforts associated with the
preferred auction. The APS are redeemable at the option of the trust in whole
or in part at the redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated
and unpaid dividends. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption if
certain requirements relating to their asset maintenance coverage are not
satisfied. The trust is required to maintain certain asset coverage with
respect to the APS as defined in the trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

In accordance with the provisions of EITF D-98, "Classification and
measurements of Redeemable Securities", the trust has reclassified its Auction
Preferred Shares outside of permanent equity in the Net Assets section of the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, distributions to APS
shareholders are classified as a component of the "Change in net assets from
operations" on the Statement of Operations and Statement of Changes in Net
Assets and as a component of the "Total from investment operations" in the
Financial Highlights.

(8) LOSS CONTINGENCY

The issuers of certain bonds held in the fund's portfolio have made public that
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in connection with an audit of their bonds,
has made either a Preliminary Adverse Determination or a Proposed Adverse
Determination that interest paid on the bonds is not excludable from gross
income for federal tax purposes. While the final resolution is uncertain at
this time, the bond issuers may enter into closing agreements with the IRS in
satisfaction of all taxes owed. However, if a bond issuer does not settle with
the IRS and the IRS issues a final determination of taxability, the fund may be
required to amend Form 1099-DIVs issued to shareholders or may enter into a
closing agreement with the IRS and pay an agreed upon amount in lieu of
reissuing 1099s. Depending on the final disposition of the various audits, an
estimate of the cumulative tax liability, including interest, could range from
$0 to $393,129, or a maximum share impact of less than $0.01 per share.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Municipal Income Trust:

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of investments,
as of April 30, 2007, and the related statement of operations, changes in net
assets, and financial highlights for the six-month period ended April 30,
2007. These interim financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements and financial
highlights referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of changes
in net assets for the year ended October 31, 2006, and financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period ended October 31, 2006, and in our
report dated December 21, 2006, we expressed an unqualified opinion on such
statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase Fund shares
annually. The notification to shareholders of the program is included in the
semi-annual and annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs
begin on March 1st of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule
10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of
Fund shares that may be repurchased in each annual period (March 1 through the
following February 28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the
first day of the plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of Fund shares
available for repurchase for the March 1, 2007 plan year is 4,016,342.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (as required by Item
22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A), or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the effectiveness of the registrant's
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act")) as conducted within 90 days of
    the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal
    financial officer and principal executive officer have concluded that those
    disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the
    material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on this
    report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
    forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by the report that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

    (1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit.

    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2
        under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.

(b) If the report is filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
    provide the certifications required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act (17 CFR
    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title
    18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r),
    or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such certification
    will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under
    the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that
    the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference: Attached hereto.
