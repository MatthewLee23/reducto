NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2009 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION

            Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. (the "Company") was
            organized as a limited liability company under the laws of Delaware
            in January 1999. The Company is registered under the Investment
            Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a closed-end,
            non-diversified management investment company. The Company's term is
            perpetual unless the Company is otherwise terminated under the terms
            of the Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of June 5, 2003.
            The Company's investment objective is to achieve maximum capital
            appreciation. It pursues this objective by actively investing in a
            portfolio consisting generally of equity securities of technology
            companies and of companies which derive a major portion of their
            revenue directly or indirectly from technological events and
            advances. The Company's portfolio of securities in the technology
            area is expected to include long and short positions primarily in
            equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. companies. Equity securities
            include common and preferred stock and other securities having
            equity characteristics, including convertible debt securities, stock
            options, warrants and rights.

            Responsibility for the overall management and supervision of the
            operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as
            the Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of Managers").
            There are six members of the Board of Managers, one of whom is
            considered an "interested person" under the Act. The Company's
            investment adviser is Advantage Advisers Management, L.L.C., a
            Delaware limited liability company (the "Adviser"). The Adviser is a
            subsidiary of Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc. ("OAM") and an
            affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. ("Oppenheimer"). The Adviser is
            responsible for managing the Company's investment activities
            pursuant to an investment advisory agreement dated June 5, 2003. OAM
            is the managing member of the Adviser, and Alkeon Capital Management
            L.L.C. ("Alkeon") is a non-managing member of the Adviser.
            Investment professionals employed by Alkeon, including Mr. Takis
            Sparaggis, who serves as the Company's portfolio manager, manage the
            Company's portfolio on behalf of the Adviser under the supervision
            of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit participation interest in
            Alkeon.

            The acceptance of initial and additional contributions from Members
            is subject to approval by the Board of Managers. At a meeting held
            on November 1, 2004, the Board of Managers approved the acceptance
            of initial contributions to the Company from new members on or after
            January 1, 2005. The Company may from time to time offer to
            repurchase interests pursuant to written tenders by Members. Such
            repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be
            determined by the Board of Managers, in its complete and exclusive
            discretion. The Adviser expects that generally it will recommend to
            the Board of Managers that the Company offer to repurchase interests
            from Members twice each year, effective at the end of the second
            fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

            Generally, except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall
            not be liable for the Company's debts, obligations and liabilities
            in any amount in excess of the capital account balance of such
            Member, plus such Member's share of undistributed profits and
            assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2009 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
            generally accepted accounting principles requires the Adviser to
            make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
            the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser
            believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's
            financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual
            results could differ from these estimates.

            a. REVENUE RECOGNITION

            Securities transactions, including related revenue and expenses, are
            recorded on a trade-date basis, and dividends are recorded on the
            ex-dividend date, net of applicable withholding taxes. Interest
            income and expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and
            discounts on fixed income securities are amortized using the
            effective interest rate method.

            b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The Company's securities are valued at fair value in accordance with
            policies adopted by the Board of Managers, which are summarized
            below.

            (i)   Domestic exchange traded securities (other than options and
                  those securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

                  (1)   at their last composite sale prices as reported on the
                        exchanges where those securities are traded; or

                  (2)   if no sales of those securities are reported on a
                        particular day, the securities are valued based upon
                        their composite bid prices for securities held long, or
                        their composite asked prices for securities sold, not
                        yet purchased, as reported by those exchanges.

            (ii)  Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

                  (1)   at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is
                        the last trade price at or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern
                        Time) adjusted up to NASDAQ's best offer price if the

            b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

                  (3)   if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

                  (4)   if no sale is shown and no bid price is available, the
                        price will be deemed "stale" and the value will be
                        determined in accordance with the fair valuation
                        procedures set forth herein.

            Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange are valued at
            their last sale prices on the exchange where such securities are
            primarily traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a
            particular day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held
            long) or asked prices (in the case of securities sold, not yet
            purchased) as reported by such exchange. Listed options are valued
            at their bid prices (or asked prices in the case of listed written
            options) as reported by the exchange with the highest volume on the
            last day a trade was reported. Other securities for which market
            quotations are readily available are valued at their bid prices (or
            asked prices in the case of securities sold, not yet purchased) as
            obtained from one or more dealers making markets for those
            securities. If market quotations are not readily available, the fair
            value of the securities and other assets are determined in good
            faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

            Foreign-denominated assets may involve more risks than domestic
            transactions, including political, economic, and regulatory risk.
            Risks may also arise from the potential inability of a counterparty
            to meet the terms of a contract and from unanticipated movements in
            the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

            Debt securities are valued in accordance with the procedures
            described above, which with respect to such securities may include
            the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a
            matrix to determine valuation for normal institutional size trading
            units or consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.
            The Board of Managers will periodically monitor the reasonableness
            of valuations provided by any such pricing service. Debt securities
            with remaining maturities of 60 days or less will, absent unusual
            circumstances, be valued at amortized cost, so long as such
            valuation is determined by the Board of Managers to represent fair
            value.

            All assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies
            are converted into U.S. dollars using foreign exchange rates
            provided by a pricing service compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time.
            Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values
            of such securities are determined, prior to the close of securities
            markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior
            to such close. On occasion, the values of such securities and
            exchange rates may be affected by events occurring between the time
            such values or exchange rates are determined and the time that the
            net asset value of the Company is determined. When such events
            materially affect the values of securities held by the Company or
            its liabilities, such securities and liabilities are fair valued as
            determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board
            of Managers.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

            b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            The determination of fair value shall take into account the relevant
            factors and surrounding circumstances, which may include: (i) the
            nature and pricing history (if any) of the security or other
            investment; (ii) whether any dealer quotations are available; (iii)
            possible valuation methodologies that could be used to determine
            fair value; (iv) the recommendation of the Adviser with respect to
            the valuation; (v) whether the same or similar securities or other
            investments are held by other accounts or other funds managed by the
            Adviser and the valuation method used by the Adviser with respect
            thereto; (vi) the extent to which the fair value to be determined
            will result from the use of data or formulae produced by third
            parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
            illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

            The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify
            as financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
            Instruments," approximates the carrying amounts presented in the
            Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
            issued STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL STANDARDS NO. 157, "FAIR VALUE
            MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition of
            fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for
            measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the
            use of fair value measurements. The Company adopted FAS 157 as of
            January 1, 2008.

            Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Company's
            investments. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels
            listed below.

            Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices
            for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

            Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted
            prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayments speeds,
            credit risk, etc.).

            Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's
            own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

            The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not
            necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in
            these securities.

            in valuing the Company's investments at fair value.

</TABLE>

            c. CASH EQUIVALENTS

            The Company treats all highly liquid financial instruments that
            mature within three months at the time of purchase as cash
            equivalents. At June 30, 2009, $114,196,632 in cash equivalents was
            held at PNC Bank in a money market account.

            d. INCOME TAXES

            The Company has reclassified $10,257,483 and $7,854,136 from
            accumulated net investment loss and accumulated net realized loss on
            investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the
            year ended December 31, 2008. This reclassification was a result of
            permanent book to tax differences to reflect, as an adjustment to
            net capital contributions, the amounts of taxable loss and net
            realized gain on investments that have been allocated to the
            Company's Members and had no effect on net assets.

            The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting
            Standards Board Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for
            Uncertainty in Income Taxes". This standard defines the threshold
            for recognizing the benefits of tax-return positions in the
            financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by
            the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position
            meeting the more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest
            benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

            d. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

            Management has analyzed the Company's tax positions taken on Federal
            income tax returns for all open tax years (tax years ended December
            31, 2005-2008), and has concluded that a liability of $3,142,315
            capital gain country tax is required in the Company's financial
            statements.

            The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to
            unrecognized tax benefits within country tax expense in the
            statement of operations.

            Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return
            its distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

      3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

            Oppenheimer provides certain administrative services to the Company
            including, among other things, providing office space and other
            support services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays
            Oppenheimer a monthly administration fee of 0.08333% (1% on an
            annualized basis) of the Company's net assets determined as of the
            beginning of the month.

            During the six months ended June 30, 2009, Oppenheimer earned
            $41,355 as brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions
            executed on behalf of the Company. Mainsail Group, L.L.C., a
            broker-dealer affiliate of Alkeon, earned $828,058 as brokerage
            commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of the
            Company.

            Net profits or net losses of the Company for each fiscal period are
            allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital
            accounts of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of
            the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with Members'
            respective investment percentages for the fiscal period. The
            Adviser, in its capacity as the Special Advisory Member of the
            Company, is entitled to receive an incentive allocation (the
            "Incentive Allocation"), charged to the capital account of each
            Member as of the last day of each allocation period, of 20% of the
            amount by which net profits, if any, exceed the positive balance in
            the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive Allocation is
            credited to the Special Advisory Account of the Adviser. By the last
            business day of the month following the date on which an Incentive
            Allocation is made, the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of the
            Incentive Allocation that was credited to the Special Advisory
            Account with respect to the allocation period. During the six months
            ended June 30, 2009, an Incentive Allocation of $22,252 was credited
            to the Special Advisory Member's capital account and was included in
            withdrawals payable at June 30, 2009, in the Statement of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            Each member of the Board of Managers (each a "Manager") who is not
            an "interested person" of the Company, as defined by the Act,
            receives an annual retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each meeting
            attended. The lead independent Manager receives an additional fee of
            $2,500. Managers who are

      3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

            "interested persons" do not receive any annual or other fee from the
            Company. Managers who are not "interested persons" are reimbursed by
            the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
            them in performing their duties.

            PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian") serves as custodian of the
            Company's assets.

            PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. ("PNC"), formerly known as PFPC
            Inc., serves as investor services and accounting agent to the
            Company and in that capacity provides certain accounting,
            record-keeping and investor related services. The Company pays PNC
            an accounting and investor services fee based primarily on the
            average net assets of the Company as of the last day of each month,
            payable monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

            Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive placement agent for the
            Company, without special compensation from the Company, and bears
            costs associated with its activities as placement agent. However,
            the placement agent is entitled to charge a sales commission of up
            to 3% (up to 3.1% of the amount invested) in connection with a
            purchase of interests, at its discretion. For the six months ended
            June 30, 2009, such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted
            to $138,048.

      4.    INDEMNIFICATIONS

            The Company has entered into several contracts that contain routine
            indemnification clauses. The Company's maximum exposure under these
            arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that
            may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However,
            based on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be
            remote.

      5.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

            Aggregate purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
            short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30, 2009,
            amounted to $1,247,481,632 and $1,363,140,115, respectively.
            Aggregate purchases and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,
            excluding short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
            2009, amounted to $806,525,200 and $710,353,230, respectively.

            At December 31, 2008, the aggregate cost for Federal income tax
            purposes of portfolio investments and securities sold, not yet
            purchased was $782,927,946, and $433,919,218, respectively.

            For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2008, accumulated
            net unrealized depreciation on portfolio investments and securities
            sold, not yet purchased was $87,746,949, consisting of $100,553,866
            gross unrealized appreciation and $188,300,815 gross unrealized
            depreciation.

            Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold,
            not yet purchased, net of excess cash, held at the prime broker as
            of June 30, 2009 and is used as collateral for securities sold, not
            yet purchased.

      6.    SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

            The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that
            connection, borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment
            purposes. Trading in equity securities on margin involves an initial
            cash requirement representing at least 50% of the underlying
            security's value with respect to transactions in U.S. markets and
            varying percentages with respect to transactions in foreign markets.
            The Act requires the Company to satisfy an asset coverage
            requirement of 300% of its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed,
            measured at the time the Company incurs the indebtedness. The
            Company pays interest on outstanding margin borrowings at an
            annualized rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%. The Company pledges securities
            as collateral for the margin borrowings, which are maintained in a
            segregated account held by the Custodian. For the six months ended
            June 30, 2009, the average daily amount of such borrowings was
            $10,496,193 and the daily weighted average annualized interest rate
            was 1.26%. The Company had borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2009,
            totaling $10,805,810 recorded as due to broker on the Statement of
            Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      7.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK

            In the normal course of business, the Company may trade various
            financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
            with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include
            options, swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. Generally,
            these financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase
            or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified
            future dates. Each of these financial instruments contains varying
            degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market
            value of the securities underlying the financial instruments may be
            in excess of the amounts recognized in the statement of assets,
            liabilities and members' capital.

            The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times,
            may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced
            any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to
            any significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

            Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the
            Company to deliver specified securities and thereby creates a
            liability to purchase such securities in the market at prevailing
            prices. Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet
            risk as the Company's ultimate obligation to satisfy the sale of
            securities sold, not yet purchased may exceed the amount indicated
            in the statement of assets, liabilities and members' capital.
            Primarily all investments in securities sold, not yet purchased and
            due from broker are positions with, and amounts due from, the prime
            broker, Morgan Stanley. Accordingly, the Company has a concentration
            of individual counterparty credit risk with the prime broker. The
            Company pledges securities in an account at PFPC Trust Company, for
            the benefit of the prime broker, to meet the margin requirement as
            determined by the prime broker.

      7.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

            A swap is a contract under which two parties agree to make periodic
            payments to each other based on specified interest rates, an index
            or the value of some other instrument, applied to a stated, or
            "notional" amount. Swaps generally can be classified as interest
            rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity swaps or equity swaps which
            can also include contracts for difference, depending on the type of
            index or instrument used to calculate the payments. Such swaps would
            increase or decrease the Company's investment exposure to the
            particular interest rate, currency, commodity or equity involved.
            Securities associated with swaps are marked-to-market based on the
            Company's valuation procedures that are outlined in Section 2b of
            these notes. The change in value of swaps, including the periodic
            amounts of interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as
            unrealized gains or losses in the Statement of Operations. Net
            unrealized gains are reported as an asset and net unrealized losses
            are reported as a liability on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities
            and Members' Capital. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
            payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap
            agreements.

            Most swap agreements entered into by the Company require the
            calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a
            "net basis." Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a
            swap agreement generally will be equal to only the net amount to be
            paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of
            the positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net
            amount").

            The Company is subject to the market risk associated with changes in
            the value of the underlying investment or instrument, as well as
            exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance
            on swap contracts. The risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited
            to the net amount of payments that the Company is contractually
            obligated to make. If the other party to a swap defaults, the
            Company's risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that
            the Company contractually is entitled to receive, which may be
            different than the amounts recorded on the Statement of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            The unrealized appreciation/depreciation, rather than the notional
            amount, represents the approximate future cash to be received or
            paid, respectively.

            The Company may write (sell) put and call options on securities or
            derivative instruments in order to gain exposure to or protect
            against changes in the markets.

            The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Company
            pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally,
            the Company bears the risk of loss of premium and change in market
            value should the counterparty not perform under the contract. Put
            and call options purchased are accounted for in the same manner as
            investment securities.

      7.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

            When the Company writes an option, the premium received by the
            Company is recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to
            the current market value of the option written. If a written call
            option is exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the
            sale of the underlying security in determining whether the Company
            has realized a gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the
            premium reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased by the
            Company. In writing an option, the Company bears the market risk of
            an unfavorable change in the price of the security or index
            underlying the written option. Exercise of a written option by a
            counterparty could result in the Company selling or buying a
            security at a price different from the current market value. During
            for the six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company had no
            transactions in written options.

            The Company adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
            No. 161 "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
            Activities" ("FAS 161"). FAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures
            about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
            disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on
            derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related
            contingent features in derivative agreements. All changes to
            accounting policies and disclosures have been made in accordance
            with FAS 161 and are incorporated for the current period as part of
            the disclosures within this Note.

III.  APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a meeting held on March 26, 2009, the Board of Managers of the Company (the
"Board") completed its annual consideration of, and approved the renewal of, the
Company's investment advisory agreement with the Adviser.

In approving the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, the Board,
including each of the Independent Managers, reviewed various written materials
provided by the Adviser at the request of the Board and assessed: (i) the
nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Company; (ii) the
investment performance of the Company relative to other comparable funds; (iii)
advisory fees and other fees and expenses of the Company (including fee
information for comparable funds) and the profitability of the Adviser; (iv) the
extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Company's assets
under management increase; and (v) whether advisory fee levels reflect any such
economies of scale for the benefit of investors. The Board also approved the
renewal of the administrative services agreement between the Company and
Oppenheimer, an affiliate of the Adviser, which provides certain administrative
services to the Company.

In considering the nature, extent and quality of services that the Adviser
provides to the Company, the Board reviewed presentations from management
relating to staffing, management and the organizational structure of the various
departments of Oppenheimer providing services to the Company. The Board also
reviewed with management the investment management, compliance, regulatory, risk
management, administration, accounting, infrastructure and investor services
provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer and reviewed the costs associated with
providing these services.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Independent Managers had, over the previous twelve months, also considered
various matters, including: Oppenheimer's commitment to the advisory business,
including the alternative investment advisory business, and its platform of
proprietary products; the research and portfolio management capabilities of the
personnel responsible for managing the Company's assets; the appropriateness of
the Adviser's staffing levels and the commitment of resources to fund accounting
and administration, shareholder services and regulatory compliance; the
Adviser's oversight of third party service providers; the Company's investment
performance and the profitability of the Adviser attributable to providing
services to the Company, among other matters.

Based on its review, the Board concluded that the Company benefits from the
services provided by the Adviser, including research and portfolio management
services and also benefits from the administrative services and compliance
infrastructure provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer. The Board noted its
overall satisfaction with the nature, extent and quality of services provided by
the Adviser and concluded that the Company was receiving the services required
from the Adviser under its agreement with the Company, and that these services
were of appropriate quality.

The Board also reviewed materials relating to the Company's investment
performance on a quarterly basis. The Board also considered the Company's
historical investment performance, including a comparison of such performance to
the performance of similar funds and relevant indices. The consensus of the
Board was that during the past year the investment performance of the Company
was competitive with its peers. The indirect benefits received by the Adviser
and its affiliates attributable to its relationships to the Company also were
considered.

The Board also considered the advisory fees and current and historical expense
ratios of the Company for the services provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer
under the investment advisory agreement and administrative services agreement,
respectively. The Independent Managers concluded that the fees paid to
Oppenheimer and the Adviser were reasonable and appropriate and were within
industry norms, based on the comparisons to similar funds. In particular, a fee
comparison showed that the fees charged -- a 1.0% management fee and 20%
incentive allocation -- were at the mid-to-lower end of fees charged for similar
products. In this regard, the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's fees
to those of comparable registered funds, and concluded that the Company's fees
are similar to those of the other funds. The Board also considered revenues
received by the Adviser and Oppenheimer from the Company, including management
fees and incentive allocations, as well as data regarding the Adviser's
financial condition, compensation and profitability, including related direct
and indirect operating expenses relating to the Company and payments made to
registered representatives of Oppenheimer for services they provide to
investors. The Board noted that registered representatives of Oppenheimer
continue to be paid out of Oppenheimer's resources for providing various
investor services. The Board noted that the Adviser had not realized significant
profits during the previous year from its relationship with the Company but
continues to be willing to manage the Company. The Adviser reviewed with the
Board the methodology used to estimate these costs and profits of the Adviser,
as set forth in the profitability materials provided by management. It also
considered the indirect benefits received by the Adviser and its affiliates
attributable to their relationships to the Company.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on its review of information relating to the Company's fees and expenses
and the profitability of the Adviser and its affiliates, the Board concluded
that the Company's fees under the investment advisory agreement and
administrative services agreement bear a reasonable relationship to the services
provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer.

With respect to whether the Company benefits from economies of scale in costs
associated with services provided to the Company, the Board concluded that
economies of scale are not being realized at the current asset levels.

Based on the considerations described above, the following conclusions and
determinations were made by the Board, including all of the Independent
Managers:

      1.    the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the
            Adviser were adequate and appropriate;

      2.    the fees paid to the Adviser and Oppenheimer are reasonable and
            appropriate in light of both comparative fee information and
            benefits to be derived by the Adviser and Oppenheimer from their
            relationships with the Company;

      3.    the Adviser's fees are reasonable in light of the advisory fees
            charged by the Adviser (and other affiliates) and other unaffiliated
            investment advisers to similar investment vehicles receiving similar
            services and in light of the fact that, absent any performance
            allocation, the expenses associated with providing services to the
            Company had exceeded in the past, and may exceed in the future, the
            fees payable by the Company;

      4.    in light of a declining level of Company assets over the past
            several years, economies of scale are not being realized by the
            Adviser or Oppenheimer at current asset levels; and

      5.    the approval of the renewal of the Company's investment advisory
            agreement and administrative services agreement for an additional
            annual period is in the best interests of the Company and its
            Members.

      (a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

            period in which this report is being prepared;

      (b)   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
            such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

            accepted accounting principles;

      (c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      (a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
