                         GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management groups--
                            Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

Semiannual Report

Franklin Templeton
Limited Duration Income Trust

YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent it is possible and consistent with the
Fund's primary objective, through a portfolio consisting primarily of high yield
corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities.

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust's
semiannual report for the period ended September 30, 2009.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust had cumulative total returns of +30.65% based on net asset value and
+37.49% based on market price. Net asset value increased from $10.15 per share
on March 31, 2009, to $12.76 at period-end, and the market price rose from $8.92
to $11.76 over the same time. You can find the Fund's performance data in the
Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the six-month period ended September 30, 2009, the U.S. economy began to
show signs of recovery as many of the forces that had hindered the

economy dissipated. Financial markets stabilized in response to the federal
stimulus package and the Federal Reserve Board's (Fed's) interventions, and
investor risk appetite improved. In March, many investors reentered the stock
market and started a rally that brought the major indexes off this cycle's lows.
In 2009's third quarter, a number of blue-chip companies released reports that
showed better-than-expected profits resulting from cost-cutting measures.
Manufacturing activity improved over the period. Consumer confidence rebounded
in the second quarter of 2009 due to improved expectations. Economic activity as
measured by gross domestic product (GDP) improved from earlier in 2009. GDP was
an annualized -0.7% in 2009's second quarter and an estimated annualized 3.5% in
the third quarter. These positive signs, however, were constrained by a rising
unemployment rate, which reached 9.8% by period-end, a 26-year high.(1) Despite
improving economic data, most industries eliminated jobs.

As economic conditions improved, oil prices increased from $49 per barrel in
March to $70 in September, still well below 2008 highs. September's inflation
rate was an annualized -1.3%.(1) Core inflation, which excludes food and energy
costs, rose at a 1.5% annualized rate, which was within the Fed's informal
target range of 1.5% to 2.0%.(1) The core personal consumption expenditures
price index reported a 12-month increase of 1.3%.(2)

During the period under review, an improving economy and decelerating inflation
prompted policymakers to maintain low interest rates and discontinue certain
stimulus plans. Noting it now believes the recession has ended, the Fed left the
federal funds target rate unchanged at a range of 0% to 0.25% for an extended
period and began to lay the groundwork for an eventual tightening of monetary
policy. Near period-end, the Fed assessed which support programs it created or
expanded could be phased out.

Most Treasury prices fell during the period, and fixed income spreads narrowed
relative to Treasury yields due to reduced market turbulence and increased risk
tolerance. The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 236
basis points (100 basis points equal one percentage point) at the end of
September from 190 basis points at the beginning of the reporting period. The
two-year Treasury bill yield rose from 0.81% to 0.96% over the six-month period,
while the 10-year Treasury note yield rose from 2.71% to 3.31%.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, predominantly high
yield corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage-
and other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The period under review was marked by a remarkable recovery in most financial
markets, including those that represent the majority of the Fund's investments.
Buoyed by hopes that government stimulus plans would cause the desired effect,
the markets seized on an improvement in the rate of economic decline, if not on
economic growth itself, to propel securities prices higher. First and second
fiscal quarter corporate earnings also came in ahead of reduced expectations, as
cost cutting helped offset a decline in revenues. This positive earnings news,
along with the forward-looking nature of the stock market, helped to propel the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) up 34.02% for the six-month period.(3)
Conversely, U.S. Treasury returns were negative, as expectations for an
improving economy and the resulting fears of inflationary pressures drove up the
10-year Treasury yield. Money market yields remained near zero as the government
kept short-term rates low to provide further economic stimulus. In this
environment, investors moved into riskier asset classes in search of yield and
returns. Accordingly, high yield corporate bonds and leveraged loans generated
impressive returns. The more conservative mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
market generated positive, if more muted, returns. During the period under
review, we increased our holdings of high yield corporate bonds, partially
offset by a reduction in holdings of investment grade corporate bonds. We
reduced our exposure to MBS, while our exposure to bank loans remained
relatively unchanged.

HIGH YIELD CORPORATE BONDS

High yield corporate bonds enjoyed an explosive rebound, with the Credit Suisse
(CS) High Yield Index returning +37.20% as concerns about deteriorating
fundamentals and a rise in default levels gave way to expectations of an
economic recovery.(4) Actual defaults, while elevated from prerecession levels,
proved to be more benign than expected. In addition, capital markets reopened
and allowed companies to refinance debt to extend maturities or remove onerous
covenants, which reduced future default expectations. Highlighting the high
yield sector's improvement was the fact that spreads over Treasuries fell by
nearly half during the period, from 14.95 percentage points to 7.64 percentage
points. At period-end, the spread level was still higher than the historical
average of approximately six percentage points since 1990.(5) Given what we
believed were still favorable valuations and attractive investment opportunities
particularly in the new-issue market, we increased the Fund's exposure to high
yield corporate bonds during the period under review.

FLOATING RATE BANK LOANS

For the six months ended September 30, 2009, the bank loan asset class rallied
strongly and returned +30.42%, as measured by the CS Leveraged Loan Index.(6)
The loan market's strength was driven by loan repayments from net proceeds
raised from new high yield bond and equity issuance that gave investors more
cash. As liquidity and credit market conditions improved, investors saw value in
the lower-rated loans (rated CCC and below), and this category rallied the most,
including those loans closest to covenant or payment default. As a result,
secondary loan prices rebounded from 75.2 cents on the dollar at the beginning
of the period to 91.5 at period-end.(7) The average discounted spread to
maturity narrowed from 991 basis points to 487 basis points.(7)

<PAGE>

Amendment activity continued to increase during the period, including
traditional covenant-changing amendments and a new type of amendment known as
"amend and extend." An "amend and extend" transaction allowed an issuer to
extend the maturity on existing term loans in exchange for higher fees and
pricing, thereby pushing out near-term maturities and paving the way for a
comprehensive refinancing when better market conditions return. This exchange
improved the loan's risk/reward profile, which often led to price increases in
the secondary market. The increased amendment activity also resulted in a slower
increase in the overall default rate.

MORTGAGE- AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

During the six months under review, the overall MBS market delivered positive
results, but lagged the robust performance of the high yield corporate bond and
bank loan sectors. During the period, the Fed's $1.25 trillion agency mortgage
purchase program provided support to the agency mortgage-backed securities
market. The Fed introduced the program, first announced in November 2008, to
facilitate mortgage credit availability during the financial downturn, and it is
expected to conclude by March 31, 2010. As the end of the program approaches,
the market has begun to focus on the Fed's strategy to exit the program, which
created a less favorable technical environment.

The Fund's coupon allocation remained relatively constant over the period. The
increase in Treasury and mortgage rates, along with declining home prices, loss
of home equity and tighter underwriting standards, reduced the prospect for
prepayment risk for higher coupon MBS. Our heaviest MBS allocation was to
coupons in the 5.0% through 6.5% range. We continued to invest in bonds from
higher quality securitized sectors as we found fundamentally sound bonds at what
we considered attractive yields in these markets, and we remained allocated to
higher quality asset-backed securities and commercial MBS.

PERFORMANCE DATA REPRESENT PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE
RESULTS. INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND YOU MAY HAVE
A GAIN OR LOSS WHEN YOU SELL YOUR SHARES. CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY DIFFER FROM
FIGURES SHOWN.

ENDNOTES

INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS WILL AFFECT THE FUND'S SHARE
PRICE AND YIELD. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER YIELDING, LOWER-RATED
SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT AND LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.

(1.) Figures are for common shares. As of 9/30/09, the Fund had leverage in the
     amount of 31.68% of the Fund's total assets. The Fund employs leverage
     through the issuance of Auction Preferred Shares and purchase of Mortgage
     Dollar Rolls. The use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
     increased income but, at the same time, creates special risks (including
     the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
     common shares). The cost of leverage rises and falls with changes in
     short-term interest rates. Such increases/decreases in the cost of the
     Fund's leverage may be offset by increased/decreased income from the Fund's
     floating rate investments.

(2.) Total return calculations represent the cumulative and average annual
     changes in value of an investment over the periods indicated. Six-month
     return has not been annualized.

(3.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions at net asset value.

(4.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions based on the dividend reinvestment
     plan.

(5.) Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the Fund's 7.6 cent per
     share September dividend and the NYSE Amex closing price of $11.76 on
     9/30/09.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Plan) offers you a prompt and simple way
to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions (Distributions) in shares
of the Fund. PNC Global Investment Servicing (Agent), P.O. Box 43027,
Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the Plan. The
Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as your
outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.


                             Semiannual Report | 9

<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
NYSE Amex, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange on such date. The
net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the amount most recently
calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued.


                             10 | Semiannual Report

<PAGE>

Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to your account. If you
terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will adjust for any such
undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of shares at the time
of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at (800) 331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (Fund) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Equity and other securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ
National Market System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official
closing price of the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of
the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple
markets or on multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most
representative market. Certain equity securities are valued based upon
fundamental characteristics or relationships to similar securities. Investments
in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.

Corporate debt securities, government securities, mortgage backed securities,
asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and other debt
securities generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a
securities exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services,
quotations from bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and note
transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for each security.
The Fund's pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing which
considers information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions,
quotations from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities that are
considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and
maturity date, option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections, interest
rate spreads and yield curves, to determine current value. Debt securities
denominated in a foreign currency are converted into their U.S. dollar
equivalent at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on
the date that the values of the foreign debt securities are determined.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis, to determine
current value.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A. SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis based upon the underlying investment book value,
anticipated future cash flows, market changes in comparable or similar
securities, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar securities,
or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions on the
disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of
such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed.
Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a security is
completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question the
availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio security
held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued using
fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY AND TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery and
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to
the risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date
purchase price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with
the intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date. Sufficient assets have been segregated for these securities.

D. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Fund may invest in derivative financial instruments (derivatives) in order
to manage risk or gain exposure to various other investments or markets.
Derivatives are financial contracts based on an underlying or notional amount,
require no initial investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than
would normally be required to have a similar response to changes in market
factors, and require or permit net settlement. Derivatives may contain various
risks including the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill their
obligations under the terms of the contract, the potential for an illiquid
secondary market, and the potential for market movements which may expose the
Fund to gains or losses in excess of the amounts shown on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

Derivatives are marked to market daily based upon quotations from market makers
or the Fund's independent pricing services and the Fund's net benefit or
obligation under the contract, as measured by the fair market value of the
contract, is included in net assets. Realized gain and loss and unrealized
appreciation and depreciation on these contracts for the period are included in
the Statement of Operations.

The Fund enters into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. A forward exchange contract is an agreement between the Fund and a
counterparty to buy or sell a foreign currency for a specific exchange rate on a
future date.

See Note 10 regarding other derivative information.

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund may enter into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a TBA basis.
Mortgage dollar rolls are agreements between the Fund and a financial
institution to simultaneously sell and repurchase mortgage-backed securities at
a future date. Gains or losses are realized on the initial sale, and the
difference between the repurchase price and the sale price is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss to the fund upon entering into the mortgage dollar roll.
In addition, the Fund may invest the cash proceeds that are received from the
initial sale. During the period between the

include the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations.

The Fund is investing in mortgage dollar rolls as an alternate form of leverage.
As a result, the mortgage dollar rolls are considered indebtedness or a "senior
security" for purposes of the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.

F. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

G. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of September 30, 2009, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

H. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences
may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among
capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no
impact

on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At September 30, 2009, there were 28,290,000 common shares authorized (without
par value). During the period ended September 30, 2009 and the year ended March
31, 2009 there were no shares issued; all reinvested distributions were
satisfied with previously issued shares purchased in the open market.

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003 the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. During the year
ended March 31, 2009, there was a pro rata preferred redemption of each series
totaling 4,000 shares and $100,000,000 leaving 1,200 Preferred Shares Series M,
1,200 Preferred Shares Series W and 1,200 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference totaling $90,000,000. Dividends to preferred
shareholders are cumulative and are declared weekly, at rates established
through an auction process. The weekly auctions for Series M, W and F have all
failed during the period ended September 30, 2009; consequently, the dividend
rate paid on the Preferred Shares has moved to the maximum rate as

defined in the prospectus. During the period ended September 30, 2009, the
dividends on Preferred Shares ranged from 1.49% to 1.66%.

The Fund is required to maintain, on a weekly basis, a specified discounted
value of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch
Ratings and Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset
coverage for the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the period ended September 30, 2009, all requirements were met.

4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Franklin Resources, Inc. is the holding company for various subsidiaries that
together are referred to as Franklin Templeton Investments. Certain officers and
trustees of the Fund are also officers and/or directors of the following
subsidiaries:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
SUBSIDIARY                                       AFFILIATION

Franklin Templeton Services, LLC (FT Services)   Administrative manager
</TABLE>

The Fund pays an investment management fee and administrative fee to Advisers
and FT Services of 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively, per year of the average daily
managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the Fund's gross asset value minus
the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the liquidation value of the
Preferred Shares and other financial leverage.

5. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the period ended September 30, 2009, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

6. INCOME TAXES

For tax purposes, capital losses may be carried over to offset future capital
gains, if any. At March 31, 2009, the capital loss carryforwards were as
follows:

<TABLE>
<S>                                       <C>

                                          $13,991,543
                                          ===========
</TABLE>

For tax purposes, realized capital losses occurring subsequent to October 31,
may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. At March 31, 2009, the Fund deferred realized capital losses of
$17,185,747.

At September 30, 2009, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

<TABLE>
<S>                                              <C>
Cost of investments ..........................   $510,937,478
                                                 ============
Unrealized appreciation ......................   $ 19,936,569
Unrealized depreciation ......................    (24,922,696)
                                                 ------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ...   $ (4,986,127)
                                                 ============
</TABLE>

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of defaulted securities, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, payments-in-kind, and bond
discounts and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, payments-in-kind, and bond
discounts and premiums.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
period ended September 30, 2009, aggregated $489,900,898 and $471,222,562,
respectively.

8. INVESTMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market Portfolio
(Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by Advisers.
Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep
Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative fees
paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

9. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES

At September 30, 2009, the Fund had 64.72% of its portfolio invested in high
yield, senior secured floating rate notes, or other securities rated below
investment grade. These securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions
causing greater price volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk
of loss due to default than higher rated securities.

The Fund held defaulted securities and/or other securities for which the income
has been deemed uncollectible. At September 30, 2009, the aggregate value of
these securities was $10,019,796, representing 1.98% of the Fund's portfolio.
The Fund discontinues accruing income on securities for which income has been
deemed uncollectible and provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable.
The securities have been identified on the accompanying Statement of
Investments.

10. OTHER DERIVATIVE INFORMATION

11. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

From time to time, officers, directors or employees of the Fund's Investment
Manager may have discussions or enter into agreements with issuers, underwriters
or creditors' committees which, pursuant to the Fund's policies and requirements
of applicable securities laws, could prevent the Fund from trading in the
securities of such company for limited or extended periods of time.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund follows a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market data
obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own market
assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining the
value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair value
hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of September 30, 2009, in
valuing the Fund's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third-party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third-party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of policy, the
officers, directors/trustees and employees of the manager and the Proxy Group
will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with the
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve all
conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client,
distributor, broker dealer and vendor lists, information periodically gathered
from directors and officers, and information derived from other sources,
including public filings. In situations where a material conflict of interest is
identified, the Proxy Group may defer to the voting recommendation of
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of
proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with the manager's
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If the conflict is not resolved
by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter, along with the recommended
course of action by the manager, if any, to an interdepartmental Proxy Review
Committee (which may include portfolio managers and/or research analysts
employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy
Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass
Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of proxy services; or
send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group or the Proxy Review
Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board or a committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third-party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on any one of Sections 12(d)(1)(E), (F), or (G) of
the 1940 Act, or pursuant to an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests
uninvested cash in affiliated money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive
order ("cash sweep arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's
governing documents or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment
manager will vote the shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the
other holders of the Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor that the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted. However, the manager does
not consider recommendations from management to be determinative of the
manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with respect to
most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. The manager will closely
scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the
manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit
fees. The manager will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
rotate auditors, and will vote against the ratification of auditors when there
is clear and compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with the shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. However, as
with all proxy issues, the manager conducts an independent review of each
anti-takeover proposal. On occasion, the manager may vote with management when
the research analyst has concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would
not harm the Fund or its shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports
proposals that require shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject
to a shareholder vote and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case
basis to determine whether or not they warrant support. In addition, the manager
will generally vote against any proposal to issue stock that has unequal or
subordinate voting rights. The manager generally opposes any supermajority
voting requirements as well as the payment of "greenmail." The manager generally
supports "fair price" provisions and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager realizes that a company's financing
decisions have a significant impact on its shareholders, particularly when they
involve the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock or the
assumption of additional debt. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase. The manager will generally not vote in favor of dual-class capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares where that class of stock
would have superior voting rights. The manager will generally vote in favor of
the issuance of preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
dividend, conversion and other rights of such stock and the terms of the
preferred stock issuance are deemed reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether they would be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring proposals are also subject to a thorough examination on
a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
the manager's proxy voting decisions for international investments. However, the
manager must be flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied
market practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed

with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes
in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 22, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

     This  Code  shall be the sole  code of  ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

     Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  has  separately  adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS  CONDUCT  ("Business  Conduct"),  which is  applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It  summarizes  the values,  principles  and business  practices  that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers,  directors and employees  regarding the minimum  ethical  requirements
expected of them. It supplements  the values,  principles  and business  conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

     Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the CODE
OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal  securities
trading and other related  matters.  The Code for Insider  Trading  provides for
separate  requirements  that  apply to the  Covered  Officers  and  others,  and
therefore is not part of this Code.

     Insofar as other  policies or procedures of Franklin  Resources,  Inc., the
Funds, the Funds' adviser,  principal  underwriter,  or other service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are  subject to this Code,  they are  superceded  by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the  provisions  of this Code.  Please review
these other  documents or consult with the Legal  Department  if have  questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service to, the FT
Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,  or
a member of his  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the FT Funds and  already  are  subject  to  conflict  of
interest  provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds.  The FT Funds'
and the investment  advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the FT Funds,  the  investment  advisers and the fund  administrator  of
which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this
Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser,  the  administrator,
or for all  three),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and  implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The  participation  of the  Covered  Officers in such  activities  is
inherent in the contractual  relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds.  Thus,  if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized  by the FT Funds'  Boards  of  Directors  ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
