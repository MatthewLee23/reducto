Portfolio Manager's
        COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Dan Solender reviews key investment strategies and the
six-month performance of these six insured Funds. With 19 years of investment
experience, including 10 at Nuveen, Dan has managed NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG, and
NEA since 2004.


WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED
APRIL 30, 2006?

During this reporting period, we saw a general increase in interest rates,
although rates at the longer end of the yield curve remained more stable than
those at the short end throughout much of the period. Between November 1, 2005
and April 30, 2006, the Federal Reserve implemented four increases of 0.25% each
in the fed funds rate, raising this short-term target by 100 basis points--from
3.75% to 4.75%. (On May 10, 2006, the fed funds rate was increased by another 25
basis points to 5%, marking the Fed's 16th consecutive quarter-point hike since
June 2004.) In contrast, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
ended April 2006 at 5.06%, up from 4.55% six months earlier, while the yield on
the Bond Buyer 25 Revenue Bond Index, a widely followed measure of longer-term
municipal market rates, was 5.22% at the end of April 2006, an increase of just
two basis points from the beginning of November 2005. As interest rates
increased, bond valuations generally declined, and the yield curve flattened as
short-term rates approached the levels of longer-term rates.

In this environment, one of our key strategies continued to be careful duration1
management, part of which included efforts to more closely align the duration
and yield curve positioning of these Funds. In general, our purchase activity
targeted attractively priced bonds maturing in 15 to 20 years. We believed that
bonds in this part of the curve generally offered better value and reward
opportunities more commensurate with their risk levels. As the yield curve
continued to flatten, we started to see more opportunities to add value at the
longer end of the curve, and we began to move our purchases out to bonds in the
20-year to 25-year range. To help us maintain the Funds' durations within our
preferred strategic range, we were also selectively selling holdings with
shorter durations. Selling these shorter duration bonds and reinvesting further
out on the yield curve also helped to improve the Funds' overall call protection
profile.

As yields rose during this period, we also found some opportunities to sell a
few of our holdings that were purchased when yields were lower and replace them
with similar,



1    Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
     change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
     changes than bonds with shorter durations.

newer credits that yielded comparatively more. This process allowed us to
maintain the Funds' current portfolio characteristics while strengthening their
income streams. It also enabled us to realize some capital losses that can be
used to offset any capital gains realized in 2006 or carried forward to offset
future realized gains.

In looking for potential purchase candidates, we kept an opportunistic eye
toward all types of issuance that we believed could add value to the Funds'
portfolios and keep the Funds well diversified geographically. Overall,
portfolio activity was relatively light during this period. This was due in part
to the fact that these Funds entered the reporting period fully invested and
with routine call exposure. Another factor was the 5.5% decline in municipal
supply during this six-month period compared with the same period 12 months
earlier (November 2004-April 2005). The decrease in supply was even more evident
during the first four months of 2006, when new issuance dropped almost 25% from
the levels of January-April 2005. For NVG and NEA, which can invest up to 20% of
their portfolio in uninsured investment-grade quality securities, tighter supply
and declining relative valuations also meant fewer opportunities to find
lower-rated issues that we believed represented value for shareholders or
improved the structure of these two Funds.

Given the tightness of spreads in all parts of the municipal market, we
continued to purchase paper issued in specialty states such as California and
New York when we found attractively priced opportunities. Because of the
relatively higher tax levels in of these specialty states, municipal bonds
issued in these states are generally in great demand by retail investors, which
helps to support their value. They also provide additional liquidity, making it
easier for us to execute trades as part of implementing our strategies.

In NEA, our duration management strategies also included the use of forward
interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument. As discussed in
our last shareholder report, we began using these swaps in late 2004 in an
effort to reduce the interest rate risk in this Fund. These hedges were not an
attempt to profit from correctly predicting the timing and direction of interest
rate movements. Instead, our sole objective was to reduce NEA's duration (and
resulting pricing sensitivity) without having a negative impact on its income
stream or common share dividends over the short term. We believe the hedging
strategy has been effective in helping to reduce NEA's net asset value (NAV)


                                       5

volatility, and the hedge on this Fund remained in place as of April 30, 2006.
During this reporting period, the hedge performed as expected and had a positive
impact on the performance of NEA. As long-term interest rates rose, the value of
the hedge increased while the valuation of the Fund's holdings generally
declined.

For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the cumulative returns on NAV for NIO,
NVG, and NEA exceeded the return on their Lehman Brothers insured municipal
benchmark, while NQI, NIF and NPX underperformed the index. NVG and NEA also
outperformed the average return for their Lipper insured peer group, while the
other four Funds underperformed the Lipper peer group for the period.

One of the factors affecting the six-month performance of these Funds relative
to that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index was the
Funds' use of financial leverage. While leveraging can add volatility to a
Fund's NAV and share price, this strategy can also provide opportunities for
additional income and total return for

common shareholders. The benefits of leveraging are tied in part to the
short-term rates leveraged Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R) shareholders. During
periods of low short-term rates, leveraged Funds generally pay lower dividends
to their MuniPreferred shareholders, which can leave more earnings to support
common share dividends. Conversely, when short-term interest rates rise, as they
did during this reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs also rise, which
can impact the Funds' income streams and total returns. However, as long as
short-term yields are lower than those of the long-term bonds in the Funds'
portfolios, the income received by the common shareholders of leveraged Funds
will be higher than it would be if the Funds were unleveraged. Despite the
impact of rising interest rates on bond valuations, the extra income, or yield
advantage, resulting from leveraging during this period remained strong enough
to help the Funds post positive results for this six months. Over the long term,
we believe the use of financial leverage will continue to work to the benefit of
the Funds, as demonstrated by the five-year and ten-year return
performance--both absolute and relative--of the Funds in this report.

During this reporting period, positive contributors to the Funds' returns
included yield curve and duration positioning, exposure to noninsured credits in
NVG and NEA, and pre-refunding activity. As mentioned earlier, the hedging
strategies we employed in NEA also had a positive impact on the performance of
this Fund for the period.

As the yield curve continued to flatten over the course of this period, yield
curve and duration positioning played important roles in the Funds'
performances. On the whole, shorter maturity bonds were the most impacted by
recent changes in the yield curve. As a result, these bonds generally
underperformed both intermediate and long bonds, with credits having the longest
durations posting the best returns for this period. Yield curve positioning or,
more specifically, greater exposure to those parts of the yield curve that
performed well helped performance during this period, while exposure to the
short end of the curve hurt performance. This was especially true in NIF, which
had relatively heavier weightings of pre-refunded bonds and premium credits with
short calls, which were adversely affected by rising short-term rates.
Conversely, NVG and NEA, which were established in 2002, were more
advantageously positioned on the curve, with less exposure to bonds with
maturities of 10 years or less. As previously mentioned, we continued to work to
more closely align the yield curve positioning of all of these Funds.


                                       7

NEA, which can invest up to 20% of its portfolio in uninsured investment-grade
quality securities, also benefited from its allocations of lower-quality credits
during this period, as these bonds generally outperformed other credit quality
sectors. This was largely the result of investor demand for the higher yields
typically associated with lower-quality bonds, which drove up their value and
kept credit spreads narrow. As of April 30, 2006, NEA held 2% of its portfolio
in bonds rated BBB, 3% in bonds in bonds rated A, and 3% in bonds rated AA. NVG,
which also can invest in uninsured securities, held 5% of its portfolio in bonds
rated AA, but did not hold any bonds rated below AA as of the end of this
period.

We also continued to see a number of advance refundings4 during this period,
which benefited the Funds through price appreciation and enhanced credit
quality. However, as the yield curve flattened, more lower coupon bonds were
being pre-refunded, which meant that, in general, the positive impact from
refinancings was less than in the previous reporting period.

While advance refundings generally enhanced total return performance for this
six-month period, the rising interest rate environment--especially at the short
end of the yield curve--meant that the Funds' holdings of older, previously
pre-refunded bonds tended to underperform the general municipal market, due
primarily to the shorter effective maturities of these bonds. This was
especially true in the four older Funds (NQI, NIO, NIF, and NPX). Because these
pre-refunded bonds tended to produce strong income, we continued to hold them in
our portfolios. NQI, NIF, and NPX also experienced some calls affecting their
holdings of higher-yielding housing bonds, which impacted the income component
of these Funds' total returns. This had an adverse effect on their six-month
performance.



4    Advance refundings, also known as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur
     when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
     interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
     lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
APRIL 30, 2006?

We continued to believe that maintaining strong credit quality was an important
requirement. As of April 30, 2006, NQI, NIO, NIF, and NPX continued to be 100%
invested in insured and/or U.S. guaranteed securities, while NVG and NEA, which
can invest up to 20% of their portfolio in uninsured investment-grade quality
securities, had allocated 93% and 89% of their portfolios, respectively, to
insured and U.S. guaranteed bonds.

At the end of April 2006, potential call exposure for the period May 2006
through the end of 2007 ranged from 3% in NEA, NVG and NIF to 8% in NPX and NQI,
and 10% in NIO. The number of actual bond calls in all of these Funds depends
largely on future market interest rates.

Dividend and Share Price
       INFORMATION


As previously noted, all of the Funds in this report use leverage to potentially
enhance opportunities for additional income for common shareholders. During
periods of rising short-term interest rates, as was the case during this
reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs also rise, reducing the extent of
the benefits of leveraging. This resulted in one monthly dividend reduction in
NIO and NIF and two in NQI and NPX over the six-month period ended April 30,
2006. The dividends of NVG and NEA remained stable throughout the reporting
period.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of the following Funds received capital gains and net ordinary income
distributions at the end of December 2005, as follows:

These distributions, which represented an important part of the total returns of
these three Funds for this period, were generated by bond calls or by sales of
appreciated securities. This had a slight negative impact on the Funds' earning
power per common share and was a minor factor in the common share dividend
reductions noted above.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2006, all of the
Funds in this report except NEA had a positive UNII balance for financial
statement purposes and a positive UNII balance, based upon our best estimate,
for tax purposes. NEA had a negative UNII balance for financial statement
purposes and a positive UNII balance, based upon our best estimate, for tax
purposes.

1    Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

1    Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

     fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                         At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net
                         assets attributable to Preferred shares) are invested
                         in municipal securities that are either covered by
                         Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
                         Portfolio Insurance which ensures the timely payment of
                         principal and interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net
                         assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred
                         shares) may be invested in municipal securities that
                         are (i) either backed by an escrow or trust containing
                         sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
                         securities (also ensuring the timely payment of
                         principal and interest), or (ii) rated, at the time of
                         investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB
                         or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch) or unrated but
                         judged to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

                    (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments
                         are based on net assets applicable to Common shares
                         unless otherwise noted.

                    (2)  Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and
                         prices of the earliest optional call or redemption.
                         There may be other call provisions at varying prices at
                         later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may be
                         subject to periodic principal paydowns.

                    (3)  Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or
                         Moody's rating. Ratings below BBB by Standard & Poor's
                         Group or Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. are
                         considered to be below investment grade.

                    (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
                         Government or U.S. Government agency securities which
                         ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.
                         Such investments are normally considered to be
                         equivalent to AAA rated securities.

                    (5)  Effective date represents the date on which both the
                         Fund and counterparty commence interest payment
                         accruals on each forward swap contract.

                  (ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier
Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Common shares of
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
diversified management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation
The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based
on yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of derivative investments are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for a municipal bond or derivative
investment, each Fund may use a market price or fair market value quote provided
by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined that the
market price or fair market value for an investment are unavailable or
inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee,
may establish a fair value for the investment. Temporary investments in
securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as
short-term securities are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may have
extended settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2006, Insured
Opportunity (NIO) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) had outstanding
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments of $10,748,176 and $867,927,
respectively. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the
other Funds.

Investment Income
Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Federal Income Taxes
Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, and in
the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum tax
applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to
shareholders of the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income
distributions paid by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders
Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Notes to
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (continued)



Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares
The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

=========================================================================================================
</TABLE>

Insurance
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest only in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred
shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance. Each Fund may
also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
securities, or (ii) rated, at the time of investment, within the four highest
grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch) or unrated but judged to
be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Forward Swap Transactions
The Funds are authorized to invest in certain derivative financial instruments.
The Funds' use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to
mitigate the negative impact that an increase in long-term interest rates could
have on Common share net asset value. Forward interest rate swap transactions
involve each Fund's agreement with the counterparty to pay, in the future, a
fixed rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable
rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the
future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on
the notional amount of the forward


                                       72

<PAGE>

swap contract, and would increase or decrease in value based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swaps' termination date were to increase or decrease. The Funds may close out a
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss
would be recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not
involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but
rather is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not
obligated to, terminate its forward swaps before the effective date.
Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such
transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with a counterparty
failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon
termination. To minimize such credit risk, all counterparties are required to
pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of
each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain
above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when any of the Funds have an
unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have instructed the custodian to
pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately equal to the
amount of the unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral
pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations
fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount.

Custodian Fee Credit
Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Indemnifications
Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to the treatment of paydown gains and losses, timing differences
in recognizing taxable market discount and timing differences in recognizing
certain gains and losses on investment transactions.

At April 30, 2006, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by Nuveen
Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount
of assets within each individual fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen
fund shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual
fund as well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the
Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
of each Fund as follows:

                                                           INSURED QUALITY (NQI)

For the first $125 million                                                .4500%
For the next $125 million                                                 .4375

================================================================================

The annual complex-level fee, payable monthly, which is additive to the
fund-level fee, for all Nuveen sponsored funds in the U.S., is based on the
aggregate amount of total fund assets managed as stated in the table below. As
of April 30, 2006, the complex-level fee rate was .1888%.

================================================================================

(1)  The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
     calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
     the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
     all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
     in the U.S.

(2)  With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
     rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
     date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
     billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
     be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
     fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
     time as a different rate or rates is determined.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to their Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with the
Adviser or to their Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and
expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

Reinvest Automatically
       EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.



NUVEEN EXCHANGE-TRADED CLOSED-END FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Exchange-Traded Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
the shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase
price per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged on
individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

MODIFIED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over which a
bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a measure of the
sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when market interest
rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration, the more the
price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

consent of the person(s) to be nominated.

          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter
          of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or
          is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
