             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Board of Directors and Members of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") at March 31,
2008, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended,
the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in the period then
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of investments at March
31, 2008 by correspondence with the custodian and portfolio funds, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by the
Fund valued at $274,443,252 (94.81% of the Fund's net assets) at March 31, 2008,
the values of which have been fair valued by the Adviser based on estimates
provided by each portfolio fund, under the general supervision of the Board of
Directors, in the absence of readily ascertainable market values.

The below ratios are calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as applicable by the average of total monthly members' capital. Total return
amounts are calculated by geometrically linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

1.  ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end  management  investment company and
is  operating  as a  diversified  investment  company.  The Fund has many of the
features of a private  investment fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests")  are
offered  only in  private  placements  to persons  (i) who are both  "accredited
investors"  under the Securities  Act of 1933 and "qualified  clients" under the
Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and (ii) who meet other  investor
eligibility criteria established by the Fund. The primary investment  objectives
of the  Fund are to  provide  investors  (i) an  attractive,  long-term  rate of
return,  on an absolute as well as a risk-adjusted  basis,  (ii) low performance
volatility  and (iii)  minimal  correlation  with the  equity  and fixed  income
markets.  The Fund employs a multi-strategy,  multi-manager  investment strategy
premised  on the risk  control  benefits of  diversification  and the value of a
hedged  investment  approach.  The Fund seeks  diversification  by  investing in
partnerships  and other  investment  vehicles (the  "Portfolio  Funds") that (i)
pursue non-traditional  investment strategies and (ii) are expected to exhibit a
low degree of  performance  correlation,  not only with broad market indices but
also with each other.  These Portfolio Funds are managed by selected  investment
managers ("Investment Managers") who specialize in the chosen strategies.  As of
March 31, 2008, the Fund invested in 51 Portfolio Funds.

Banc of America  Investment  Advisors,  Inc. (the  "Adviser") is the  investment
adviser to the Fund.  The Adviser is registered  as an investment  adviser under
the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as amended  (the  "Advisers  Act").  The
Adviser is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Bank of America  Corporation
("BAC").   The  Adviser  has  retained   Grosvenor  Capital   Management,   L.P.
("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as subadviser to the Fund. The Adviser and the
Subadviser have been  designated as special  members (the "Special  Members") of
the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.  USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's  investments are valued by the Adviser as of the close of business on
the last business day of each month in accordance  with policies and  procedures
approved by the Board. The Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may be subject
to limitations  on  redemptions,  including the  assessment of early  redemption
fees. In addition,  market quotations for such interests are not available. As a
result,  the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds are valued at fair value,
which  normally  will be the  value  determined  by the  Portfolio  managers  or
administrators  of the Portfolio  Funds.  Such value of the Fund's interest in a
Portfolio Fund generally  represents the Fund's  proportionate  share of the net
assets of the Portfolio  Fund. The value of the Fund's  investments in Portfolio
Funds is generally increased by additional  contributions to the Portfolio Funds
and the Fund's share of net earnings from the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by
withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net losses from the  Portfolio  Funds.  The
Fund, the Adviser and the Subadviser rely upon audited and unaudited reports and
estimates  prepared by or for the Portfolio Fund and any other  information that
they may receive from the Portfolio Fund,  which may be subject to adjustment by
the  Portfolio  Fund or its  Portfolio  manager  or  administrator.  The  values
assigned to the Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may not represent amounts
that  would   ultimately  be  realized,   as  such  amounts   depend  on  future
circumstances  and  cannot be  determined  until the  liquidation  of the Fund's
interest in the Portfolio Fund. The estimated  value of the Fund's  interests in
Portfolio  Funds  may  differ   significantly   from  the  value  received  upon
liquidation.  The  Fund,  the  Adviser  and the  Subadviser  will not be able to
confirm  independently the accuracy of the valuations  provided by the Portfolio
Funds or their Portfolio managers or administrators.

Portfolio Funds, or their Portfolio managers or administrator,  generally use an
independent  pricing source to value the funds'  securities.  Securities with no
readily  available  market value are initially  valued at cost,  with subsequent
adjustments to values, which reflect either meaningful third-party  transactions
in the private market, or fair value deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Fund or
its Portfolio  manager or  administrator.  In such instances,  consideration may
also be given to the financial  condition  and operating  results of the issuer,
the amount that the Portfolio  Funds can  reasonably  expect to realize upon the
sale of the securities and other factors deemed  relevant by the Portfolio Funds
or its Portfolio manager or administrator.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Some of the  Portfolio  Funds may  invest  all or a portion  of their  assets in
illiquid  securities  and  may  hold  all  or a  portion  of  these  investments
separately from the rest of their portfolio.  These separate baskets of illiquid
securities  (the "side  pockets") may be subject to  restrictions on liquidation
that  are  stricter  than  the  liquidity  restrictions  applicable  to  general
interests in the Portfolio Fund. If the Fund liquidates its interest from such a
Portfolio  Fund, it may be required to maintain the side pocket  investments for
an extended  period of time and retain its interests in the  Portfolio  Fund. In
instances,  where such a  Portfolio  Fund  closes its  operations,  the Fund may
receive  an `in kind'  distribution  and fully  remove  its  interests  from the
Portfolio Fund. The value of the side pockets may fluctuate significantly.

C.  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Purchases of investments in Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the first day of
legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and sales of Portfolio Funds are recorded as
of the last day of legal  ownership  or  participation.  Purchases  and sales of
other securities are accounted for on the trade-date  basis.  Realized gains and
losses are recorded at the time of disposition  of the respective  investment on
an average cost basis.

D.  INCOME RECOGNITION

Investment income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

E.  INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

F.  CASH

Cash represents cash and cash equivalents held at PFPC Trust Company, the Fund's
custodian (the  "Custodian").  At March 31, 2008, a total of $13,641,054 in cash
was held at the  Custodian.  Of that  amount,  $825,017 was held in a segregated
account related to the holdbacks on Members' withdrawals from the Fund.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

G.  FUTURES

The Fund utilized  futures  contracts  during the year ended March 31, 2008. The
Fund's use of futures is primarily for tactical hedging purposes. Initial margin
deposits of cash and securities  are made upon entering into futures  contracts.
The  contracts are marked to market  monthly and the resulting  changes in value
are accounted for as unrealized gains and losses.  Variation margin payments are
paid or  received,  depending  upon  whether  unrealized  gains  or  losses  are
incurred.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss
equal to the  difference  between  the  proceeds  from (or cost of) the  closing
transaction and the amount invested in the contract.

Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there will
be an  imperfect  price  correlation  between  the  futures  and the  underlying
securities.  Second,  it is  possible  that  a lack  of  liquidity  for  futures
contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting  in an inability to
close a  position  prior to its  maturity  date.  Third,  the  futures  contract
involves  risk that the Fund could lose more than the  original  margin  deposit
required to initiate a futures  transaction.  The risk exists that losses  could
exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of investments or statement of assets
and liabilities.

H.  OPTIONS CONTRACTS

An option gives the owner the right,  but not the  obligation,  to buy or sell a
specified  item at a fixed price during a specified  period for a  nonrefundable
fee (the  "premium").  The  maximum  loss to the buyer is limited to the premium
originally  paid.  The  premiums  paid for the  purchase  of these  options  are
included in the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and  members'  capital as an
investment  and  subsequently  marked-to-market  to  reflect  the  value  of the
options, with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included in the statement
of operations.

As a writer  of  options,  the Fund  receives  a  premium  and bears the risk of
unfavorable  changes  in the  prices  of the  securities  or  index  instruments
underlying  the  options.  Premiums  received  from writing put and call options
which have not expired are presented in the liabilities section of the statement
of assets,  liabilities and members'  capital and  subsequently  adjusted to the
current  market  value of the options  written,  but not less than zero.  If the
current  market value of an option exceeds the premium  received,  the excess is
recorded as an  unrealized  loss and,  conversely,  if the  premium  exceeds the
current market value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded
as an  unrealized  gain.  The risk  exists  that  losses  could  exceed  amounts
disclosed on the schedule of investments or statement of assets and liabilities.
For the  year  ended  March  31,  2008,  the Fund had not  written  any  options
contracts.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2007 and December 31, 2007. The interests  redeemed pursuant to such tenders are
shown in the Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

4.  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years from initial  investment.  Most of the Portfolio  Funds have the
ability  to  temporarily  suspend  redemptions  in certain  circumstances.  Some
Portfolio  Funds may charge  redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the
Fund's ability to respond to changing market  conditions.  None of the Portfolio
Funds are expected to make distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

For the year ended March 31, 2008,  aggregate  purchases  and sales of Portfolio
Funds amounted to $127,001,007 and $31,054,073, respectively.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5.  CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE FUND TO PORTFOLIO FUNDS

As of March 31,  2008,  the Fund had an unfunded  investment  commitment  to GSO
Liquidity Partners, LP in the amount of $1,221,229.

6.  MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

7.  INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if  its  Interest  as of  the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter  and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive  Period.  The Hurdle
Rate Amounts for June 30, 2007, September 30, 2007, December 31, 2007, and March
31, 2008 were 4.910%,  4.986%,  4.147%, and 3.285% per annum,  respectively.  On
June 30,  2007 and  December  31,  2007,  incentive  allocations  of $50,259 and
$835,283 were realized, respectively.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

7.  INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

No additional capital would have been reallocable to the Special Members had the
Members' measurement period for incentive allocation closed on March 31, 2008.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution, and
the Member's  opening capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the
beginning of such Incentive Period,  will be allocated between the two Interests
in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that is  repurchased  or
distributed.

8.  ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC")  (also an affiliate  of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain  accounting,  record keeping,  investor related  services,  and
regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
and the administrator  based primarily upon month-end Members' capital,  subject
to a monthly minimum fee.

9.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each Board member who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by
the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer  of $6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for
each meeting attended. Any manager or officer who is an "interested person" does
not  receive  any  annual  fee or other  fees from the Fund.  All  managers  are
reimbursed by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

Investors  who  tendered  interests  in the Fund prior to the  December 31, 2005
tender  period were not paid interest on their  contingent  payment as stated on
the tender offer documents.  As a result, these investors were due interest from
the Fund in the aggregate  amount of $12,070  representing  the unpaid  interest
amount due to investors  from the date of the original  tender  payment  through
June 30,  2006.  The Adviser  reimbursed  the Fund for unpaid  interest  paid to
investors in the amount of $12,070, which activity is reflected in the statement
of changes in members' capital for the year ended March 31, 2007.

10.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
invested in such limited partnerships, limited liability companies and options.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Members and will not be  exchangeable  for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer from time to time to repurchase  Interests at the members' capital account
value,  the  Interests  are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds that
trade on a stock  exchange  or shares of  open-end  investment  companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have  limited
liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund  significant  repurchases.  Members
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be remote.

11.  LITIGATION EVENT

The events described below have not directly  impacted the Fund or had any known
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in connection  with matters  relating to mutual fund
trading.   Copies  of  the  SEC  Orders  are   available   on  the   website  at
http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of the NYAG Settlements are available as part of the
BAC Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with the events that  resulted in the NYAG  Settlements  and SEC
Orders,  various  parties filed suit against certain  Columbia Funds  (including
former Nations Funds), the Trustees of the Columbia Funds (including Trustees of
the former Nations Funds),  FleetBoston Financial Corporation (the former parent
of the Adviser) and certain of its affiliated entities and/or BAC and certain of
its  affiliated  entities.  More than 300 cases,  including  those filed against
entities  unaffiliated  with  the  Columbia  Funds,  their  Boards,  FleetBoston
Financial  Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or BAC and its affiliated
entities,  were  transferred  to a  multi-district  proceeding  in  the  Federal
District Court in Maryland for consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings.
The parties have reached  settlements  with respect to the claims in the actions
concerning  the  Columbia  Funds.  All such  settlements  are  subject  to court
approval.

Certain  other  actions  against  certain  Columbia  Funds,  the Trustees of the
Columbia Funds,  advisers and affiliated  entities,  alleging among other things
excessive fees and  inappropriate  use of fund assets for distribution and other
improper purposes,  have been consolidated in the Massachusetts federal court as
In re Columbia  Entities  Litigation on March 2, 2005. On November 30, 2005, the
judge  dismissed all claims by plaintiffs and entered final judgment in favor of
the  defendants.  The plaintiffs  appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the First  Circuit on  December  30,  2005.  A  stipulation  and  settlement
agreement  dated January 19, 2007 was filed in the First Circuit on February 14,
2007,  with a joint  stipulation  of  dismissal  and motion for remand to obtain
district court approval of the settlement. That joint motion was granted and the
appeal was  dismissed.  On March 6, 2007,  the case was remanded to the District
Court. On May 11, 2007, the District Court entered a preliminary  approval order
which granted preliminary approval of the settlement.  The settlement,  approved
by the District Court on September 18, 2007,  became effective October 19, 2007.
Pursuant to the  settlement,  the Adviser  and/or its  affiliates  made  certain
payments,  including  plaintiffs'  attorneys'  fees and  costs of  notice to its
members.

12.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Effective  April 1, 2007,  the Fund adopted the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board ("FASB") FASB  interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes ("FIN 48").  FIN 48 provides  guidance  for how  uncertain  tax  positions
should  be  recognized,  measured,  presented  and  disclosed  in the  financial
statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine  whether
the  tax  positions  are   "more-likely-than-not"  of  being  sustained  by  the
applicable   tax   authority.   Tax   positions   not   deemed   to   meet   the
more-likely-than-not  threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in
the current  year.  The Fund has  evaluated  the  application  of FIN 48 and has
determined  that it does not have a  material  impact  on the  Fund's  financial
statements.  There is no tax liability  resulting from unrecognized tax benefits
relating to uncertain  income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on the
tax  return  for the year  ended  March 31,  2008.  No income  tax  returns  are
currently  under  examination.  The  statute of  limitations  on the Fund's U.S.
Federal tax  returns  remains  open for the years  ended March 31, 2005  through
March 31,  2007.  The statute of  limitations  on the Fund's state and local tax
returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon the jurisdiction.

FASB issued a Statement  No. 157 in  September  2006,  Fair Value  Measurements,
which is effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning
after  November 15, 2007, and interim  periods  within those fiscal years.  This
statement  provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. It clarifies fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
fair value  measurements.  The standard applies whenever other standards require
(or permit)  assets or  liabilities  to be measured at fair value.  The standard
does not  expand  the use of fair  value in any new  circumstances.  The Fund is
reviewing the statement and its impact on the financial statements.

13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent to March 31, 2008, the Fund received additional capital contributions
of $150,660,706.



The Fund files its complete schedule of portfolio  holdings with the SEC for the
first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q within sixty days after
the end of the period.  The Fund's Form N-Q is  available  on the SEC website at
HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV,  and may be reviewed and copied at the SEC Public  Reference
Room in Washington,  D.C.  Information on the operation of the Public  Reference
Room may be obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.


A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to determine how
to vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio  securities,  as  well as  information
relating to how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio  securities  during
the most recent  12-month period ended June 30, is available (i) without charge,
upon  request,  by  calling  1-888-786-9977;  and  (ii)  on the SEC  website  at

        provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant  for an  engagement  that
        relates  directly  to the  operations  and  financial  reporting  of the
        registrant.

 (e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
        ----------------------------------------------------

            The  registrant's  Audit  Committee is required to  pre-approve  the
        engagement of the registrant's  independent accountants to provide audit
        and  permissible  non-audit  services to the  registrant  and  non-audit
        services to its investment  adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
        role is primarily  portfolio  management  and is  subcontracted  with or
        overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  or any  entity  controlling,
        controlled by or under common control with such investment  adviser that
        provides ongoing services to the registrant ("Adviser  Affiliates"),  if
        the engagement relates directly to the operations or financial reporting
        of the registrant.

        The Audit  Committee has adopted a Policy for  Engagement of Independent
        Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit Services ("Policy"). The Policy sets
        forth the understanding of the Audit Committee  regarding the engagement
        of the registrant's independent accountants to provide (i) audit
<PAGE>

        and permissible audit-related,  tax and other services to the registrant
        (collectively   "Fund  Services");   (ii)  non-audit   services  to  the
        registrant's  investment  adviser (not including any  sub-adviser  whose
        role is primarily  portfolio  management  and is  subcontracted  with or
        overseen by another investment adviser) and Adviser  Affiliates,  if the
        engagement relates directly to the operations or financial  reporting of
        the registrant (collectively "Fund-related Adviser Services"); and (iii)
        certain  other  audit  and  non-audit   services  to  the   registrant's
        investment   adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
        primarily portfolio  management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
        another  investment  adviser) and Adviser  Affiliates.  Unless a type of
        service  receives  general  pre-approval  under the Policy,  it requires
        specific  pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by
        the independent  accountants.  Pre-approval of non-audit services to the
        registrant,  the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
        sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio   management  and  is
        subcontracted  with or  overseen  by  another  investment  adviser)  and
        Adviser  Affiliates  may  be  waived  provided  that  the  "de  minimis"
        requirements  set forth  under  paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C)  of Rule 2-01 of
        Regulation S-X are met.

            Under the Policy,  the Audit  Committee  may  delegate  pre-approval
        authority to any  pre-designated  member or members who are  independent
        directors.  The  member(s)  to whom such  authority  is  delegated  must
        report, for informational  purposes only, any pre-approval  decisions to
        the Audit Committee at its next regular meeting.  The Audit  Committee's
        responsibilities  with respect to the pre-approval of services performed
        by the independent accountants may not be delegated to management.

            The Policy  requires  the Fund  Treasurer  or his or her designee to
        submit to the Audit  Committee,  on an annual  basis,  a schedule of the
        types  of  services  that  are  subject  to  general  pre-approval.  The
        schedule(s)  provide  a  description  of each  type of  service  that is
        subject  to general  pre-approval  and,  where  possible,  will  provide
        estimated  fee caps for each  instance of providing  each  service.  The
        Audit Committee will review and approve the types of services and review
        the projected  fees for the next fiscal year and may add to, or subtract
        from, the list of general pre-approved  services from time to time based
        on subsequent determinations.  That approval acknowledges that the Audit
        Committee is in agreement  with the specific  types of services that the
        independent accountants will be permitted to perform. The Fund Treasurer
        or his or her  designee  must  update  the  fee  amounts  to the  extent
        necessary  at each of the  regularly  scheduled  meetings  of the  Audit
        Committee.

 (e)(2) The  percentage of services  described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
        this  Item  approved  pursuant  to  the  "de  minimis"  exception  under
        paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the fiscal
        years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008 was zero.

    (f) Not applicable.

    (g) During  the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  2007 and  March 31,  2008,
        respectively,  aggregate non-audit fees of approximately  $17.14 Million
        and $71.60 Million were billed by the registrant's  principal accountant
        to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including a  sub-adviser
        whose role is primarily  portfolio  management and is  sub-contracted or
        overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  and any entity  controlling,
        controlled by, or under common control with the investment  adviser that
        provides ongoing services to the registrant.

    (h) The  registrant's  audit committee  considered  whether the provision of
        non-audit services rendered to the registrant's  investment adviser (not
        including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily  portfolio  management
        and is subcontracted  with or overseen by another  investment  adviser),
        and
<PAGE>

        any entity controlling,  controlled by, or under common control with the
        investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
        were not  pre-approved  is  compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
        accountant's independence.


ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.


ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

(a) Schedule of  Investments  in  securities of  unaffiliated  issuers as of the
    close  of the  reporting  period  is  included  as  part  of the  report  to
    shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b) Not applicable.


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The   registrant   has   delegated  to  Grosvenor   Capital   Management,   L.P.
("Grosvenor"),  its sub-adviser,  the responsibility to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, requires an
SEC-registered  investment  adviser like  Grosvenor  to  implement  proxy voting
policies and procedures  reasonably designed to ensure that they vote proxies in
the best  interests  of their  clients.  Pursuant  to that rule,  Grosvenor  has
adopted Proxy Voting  Policies and Procedures  (the "Proxy  Policies") that have
been designed to ensure that  Grosvenor  votes proxies in the best  interests of
the various  investment  management  accounts that  Grosvenor  manages  (each, a
"GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNT").

WHEN GROSVENOR IS REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO PROXY REQUESTS

Each Grosvenor-Managed  Account is either: (i) a "fund of funds" that invests in
underlying  investment funds ("PORTFOLIO FUNDS") but does not invest directly in
securities of operating  companies  except on a limited basis or (ii) a "feeder"
fund that invests in such a "fund of funds."

As a result, the most common scenario in which Grosvenor is requested to respond
to proxy requests  relating to securities held by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts is where Grosvenor is requested to vote limited partnership  interests,
limited  liability  company  interests,  shares or similar  equity  interests in
Portfolio Funds in which one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts invest. In rare
cases,  Grosvenor  is requested to vote on matters  relating to  investments  in
operating companies.

For  purposes  of  convenience,  each  request  to  vote a  security  held  by a
Grosvenor-Managed Account is referred to as a "PROXY REQUEST."

<PAGE>

MATERIAL PROPOSALS AND IMMATERIAL PROPOSALS

Grosvenor divides Proxy Requests into two general categories,  those relating to
"Immaterial Proposals" and those relating to "Material Proposals."

An  "IMMATERIAL  PROPOSAL"  is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD NOT, in the
reasonable  judgment  of  the  Grosvenor   Compliance  Officer  responsible  for
reviewing the  proposal,  either:  (a) be  reasonably  likely to have a material
adverse effect on the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) (E.G., a proposal to
approve a change in the name of a Portfolio Fund, to approve a Portfolio  Fund's
previous  year's audited  financial  statements,  to approve a Portfolio  Fund's
appointment  of  independent  auditors,  to elect new  directors  of a Portfolio
Fund); or (b) materially  adversely change the terms on which future investments
may be made by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  A  proposal  that,  if
adopted,  would change any one or more terms in a manner that is  favorable,  or
not  materially  adverse,  to  existing or future  investors  is  considered  an
"Immaterial Proposal."

A "MATERIAL  PROPOSAL" is a proposal that, if adopted,  WOULD, in the reasonable
judgment of the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  responsible  for reviewing  such
proposal,  either: (a) be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s);  or (b) materially adversely change
the   terms  on  which   future   investments   may  be  made  by  one  or  more
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST

It is Grosvenor's  policy to act on each Proxy Request relating to an Immaterial
Proposal  in  accordance  with  such  request  (unless  Grosvenor's   Operations
Committee determines otherwise).

Except as provided in the following two paragraphs and as discussed  below under
"MANAGING  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST," it is  Grosvenor's  general  policy to act on
each Proxy  Request  relating  to a Material  Proposal  in  accordance  with the
recommendation of the Grosvenor  employee who has primary  investment  authority
with respect to the securities in question (the "PRIMARY INVESTMENT PRINCIPAL"),
as long as such action would be  consistent  with the  investment  objective(s),
policies and restrictions of the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

Grosvenor's  Operations  Committee,  after due  consideration,  may  authorize a
favorable  action on a Material  Proposal even though  favorable  action on such
proposal  would not be  consistent  the  investment  objective(s),  policies and
restrictions  of the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  upon such terms and
subject to such  conditions  as the  Operations  Committee  may  determine to be
appropriate under the circumstances.

Any member of Grosvenor's  Investment Committee may object to the recommendation
of a Primary Investment Principal in response to a Proxy Request. In the case of
any such  objection,  the matter shall be referred to the Investment  Committee,
whose decision shall be final and conclusive;  provided, however, that the Chief
Executive Officer or the Operations Committee may veto any action proposed to be
taken by a  Primary  Investment  Principal  or by the  Investment  Committee  in
response to a Proxy Request.
<PAGE>

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST

Grosvenor  expects that Proxy  Requests  frequently  will  request  Grosvenor to
approve measures that reduce the rights,  powers and authority,  and/or increase
the duties and obligations,  associated with the security in question  ("ADVERSE
MEASURES").  For example,  it is anticipated that Proxy Requests frequently will
request  Grosvenor to approve  increased  fees and/or less  favorable  liquidity
provisions relating to Portfolio Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest.

Nevertheless, it is expected that a Primary Investment Principal ordinarily will
recommend  favorable  action on Proxy Requests that propose Adverse  Measures as
long as such Primary Investment Principal reasonably believes that continuing to
hold the relevant security has a reasonable  probability of conferring  benefits
on the  relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (e.g.,  continued  access  to a
high-quality  Investment  Manager) that  outweigh the adverse  affect(s) of such
Adverse Measure, considered over the anticipated holding period of such security
in the hands of the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).

MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In  furtherance  of  Grosvenor's  goal to take action on all Proxy Requests in a
manner  that  best  serves  the  interests  of  the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  Grosvenor  will not  implement  any  decision  to  respond to a Proxy
Request in a particular manner unless and until a Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer
has implemented certain procedures to: (i) identify whether Grosvenor is subject
to a conflict of interest  in taking  action in response to such Proxy  Request;
(ii) assess the  materiality  of such a conflict;  and (iii)  address a material
conflict  in a manner  designed  to serve  the best  interests  of the  affected
Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s).  A  conflict  of  interest  ordinarily  will  be
considered material if it can reasonably be argued that Grosvenor (or certain of
its  related  persons)  has an  incentive  to respond to the Proxy  Request in a
manner  designed to benefit  Grosvenor (or any such related  person) rather than
the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (even if  there  is no  ostensible
detriment to the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s) from responding to such
request  in  that  manner).  All  materiality  determinations  are  based  on an
assessment of the particular facts and circumstances.

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of  interest in taking  action in response to a
Proxy Request but that such  conflict is not material,  he or she shall issue an
instruction  to take action in response to such Proxy Request as provided  above
under "DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is  subject  to a material  conflict  of  interest  in taking  action in
response to a Proxy Request,  he or she shall, in  consultation  with such other
Grosvenor  personnel  as he  or  she  determines  to be  appropriate  under  the
circumstances,  determine how to address such conflict.  In  determining  how to
address a material conflict of interest,  the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer may
consider the following potential solutions, as well as any other solutions he or
she wishes to consider:

_   disclosing  the conflict of interest to the  participant(s)  in the relevant
    Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) and obtaining their consent (in accordance with
    the  governing  documents  of such  Account) to act on the Proxy  Request as
    provided above under  "DETERMINING  WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT
    TO A PROXY REQUEST."

_   engaging an  independent  third  party to  recommend a response to the Proxy
    Request.
<PAGE>

The Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer shall not issue an instruction to take action
in response to the Proxy Request without first  determining  that such action is
in the best interests of the affected Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).


ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

GROSVENOR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P. ("GROSVENOR")

        MANAGEMENT.  The Fund's  assets are managed  pursuant to a  Sub-Advisory
Agreement  by  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P.  ("Grosvenor").   Grosvenor
maintains an Investment Committee that is responsible for, among other things:

        -  determining  the  investment  objectives  and  constraints  for  each
investment  fund or account  that is managed or advised by  Grosvenor  (each,  a
"Grosvenor-Managed  Account").  In  the  case  of  the  Fund,  these  investment
objectives  and  constraints  are  subject to  approval  by the Fund's  Board of
Directors.

        - identifying, evaluating and approving (or disapproving) the investment
strategies in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including  the Fund,  may
invest.

        - identifying,  evaluating and approving (or  disapproving)  third-party
investment  management  firms  ("Investment  Managers")  that employ  investment
strategies that have been approved by the Investment Committee.

        - monitoring investment strategies and Investment Managers.

        Grosvenor's  Chief Executive Officer is responsible for assigning one or
more senior level investment  professionals (each, an "Investment Principal") to
each  Grosvenor-Managed  Account,  including  the  Fund,  whose  function  is to
construct a portfolio  for such  Grosvenor-Managed  Account by using  investment
strategies  and  Investment  Managers that have been approved by the  Investment
Committee  (subject  to  the  investment  objectives  and  constraints  of  such
Grosvenor-Managed Account).

        Grosvenor's  Investment  Committee  is  currently  comprised of David B.
Small, David S. Richter, and Brian A. Wolf. Michael J. Sacks,  Grosvenor's Chief

(1)     For  purposes of this  column,  "master-feeder"  structures,  which  may
    include multiple "feeder" funds, are counted as one account.
(2)     For purposes of this column, "feeders"  into a "master fund" are counted
    as individual accounts where they have performance-based fees.
(3)     Total AUM for each account is  included.  Note,  however,  that in  some
    accounts, some investors may not be subject to performance-based fees.


        COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE.  Mr.  Sacks and the  members of the  Investment
Committee each receive a fixed base salary as well as an annual bonus based upon
the success of the firm. In addition, each holds an equity participation,  which
entitles him to distributions. Compensation is not based upon the performance or
net  asset  value  of the  Fund  or any of the  other  accounts  managed  by the
Investment Committee.

        OWNERSHIP  BY  PORTFOLIO  MANAGERS.  As of March 31,  2008,  none of the
individuals at Grosvenor responsible for the day-to-day investment management of
the Fund owns any interests in the Fund.

        CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  Grosvenor is subject to significant conflicts of
interest  in  managing  the  business  and  affairs  of the Fund  and the  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts and in making  investment  decisions for them.  Such
conflicts  could  affect  Grosvenor's  objectivity  and the  performance  of the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Fund. Grosvenor has fiduciary duties
to the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts to act in good faith and with fairness in all
its dealings  with them,  and will take such duties into account in dealing with
all actual and potential conflicts of interest.

        Grosvenor and its related persons are currently  involved in, and may in
the future become involved in, other business ventures, including: (i) investing
in, entering into fee-,  revenue- or profit sharing  agreements with,  operating
and/or managing other  investment  management or investment  advisory firms; and
(ii) managing and/or administering  investment funds and accounts in addition to
existing Grosvenor- Managed Accounts.  The  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will not
share in the risks or  rewards  of such  other  ventures.  Further,  such  other
ventures will both compete with the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts for the time and
attention of Grosvenor and its related persons and potentially create additional
conflicts of interest or raise other special  considerations.  Grosvenor and its
related  persons,  in  investing  and  trading  for  accounts  (including  their
proprietary  accounts) other than the Fund, may make use of information obtained
by them in the  course of  investing  for the Fund.  Grosvenor  and its  related
persons will have no obligation to compensate  the Fund in any respect for their
receipt of such  information  or to account to the Fund for any  profits  earned
from their use of such information.

        Grosvenor and its related  persons  currently  manage or advise numerous
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  in  addition  to the Fund,  and expect to manage or
advise  additional  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  in the  future.  Certain of the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  have or will have  investment  objectives  that are
identical or substantially  similar to those of the Fund. It is not anticipated,
however, that the Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts having identical or
substantially similar investment objectives will have identical or substantially
similar investment  portfolios.  Differing investment portfolios can be expected
to result from several factors, including, without limitation, the following:

        -   different  investment  decisions  made  by the  different  Grosvenor
            portfolio  managers  assigned  to  the  different  Grosvenor-Managed
            Accounts;

        -   regulatory   and/or   tax   restrictions   that   apply  to  certain
            Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not to others;

        -   investment   constraints  imposed  by  the  Investment  Managers  of
            Portfolio  Funds on certain  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  but not on
            others;
<PAGE>

        -   the  availability  of particular  Portfolio  Funds for investment by
            Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times but not at others;

        -   different  risk/return  characteristics  (notwithstanding  that such
            Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   generally  have  similar   investment
            objectives);

        -   client-imposed portfolio management restrictions; and

        -   the  amount  of  cash   available   for   investment   by  different
            Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times.

        As a result  of  factors  such as these,  the Fund may have a  different
investment  portfolio  (and, as a result,  different  performance  results) from
other   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   even  though  the  Fund  and  such  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.

        The  Fund  and  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  may  be  managed  by
different  Grosvenor  portfolio  managers  even  though  the Fund and such other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.  Grosvenor's  portfolio managers are authorized to invest the assets
of the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts for which they have investment responsibility
in a wide range of underlying  Portfolio Funds. As a result, it is expected that
the Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will have  different  investment
portfolios   resulting  from  different   investment  decisions  made  by  their
respective  Grosvenor  portfolio  managers,  even  if  they  have  identical  or
substantially  similar  investment  objectives.  Further,  the factors described
above  are  likely  to  result in  different  portfolios  for  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that are managed by the same Grosvenor portfolio managers,  even though
such   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  have  identical  or  substantially  similar
investment objectives.

        Regulatory   and/or  tax   restrictions   may  prohibit  the  Fund  from
participating  in  investment  opportunities  that are  available to one or more
other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Similarly,  the Investment  Managers of the
Portfolio  Funds in which  the Fund  wishes  to  invest  may  impose  investment
restrictions  on the  Fund  but not on other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Such
restrictions could render the Fund ineligible to invest, in whole or in part, in
a Portfolio Fund in which one or more other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts are free
to invest, to the possible detriment of the Fund.

        Grosvenor,  its  related  persons  and  one  or  more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  may  place  assets  under the  management  of,  or  otherwise  procure
investment  advisory or investment  management  services  from,  any  Investment
Manager  directly  or  indirectly  used by one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  including the Fund. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may
invest in, or withdraw  investments  from,  a  Portfolio  Fund in which the Fund
and/or one or more other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts are  invested,  from which
they are withdrawing their investments or in which they are not invested.

        In certain  instances,  Grosvenor  may be required  to allocate  limited
investment  opportunities  in  Portfolio  Funds  among  Grosvenor,  its  related
persons, the Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Grosvenor has developed
policies and procedures for allocating  limited  investment  opportunities  in a
manner that it believes to be equitable to all Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

        Grosvenor,  its  related  persons  and  one  or  more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  that  place  assets  under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure
investment  advisory or investment  management  services  from,  any  Investment
Manager  directly  or  indirectly  used by the  Fund  and/or  one or more  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may do so on terms (including terms relating to fees
and  liquidity)  that  are  more  advantageous  than  those  applicable  to  the
investments made by the Fund and/or such other Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) with
such  Investment  Manager.  To the extent that Grosvenor or its related  persons
invest with a given Investment  Manager on terms that are more advantageous than
those on which the Fund  and/or  one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest with such Investment Manager,  Grosvenor and its related persons may have
an incentive to
<PAGE>

maintain or increase the investment by the Fund and such other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts with such  Investment  Manager in order to obtain and/or  maintain such
advantageous terms for the benefit of Grosvenor and its related persons.

         Grosvenor  and its related  persons may from time to time  invest,  for
their respective proprietary accounts, in early-stage Portfolio Funds (including
Non-Advised  Funds,  as  described  below),  at times when  investments  in such
Portfolio  Funds  are not  appropriate  for the Fund or other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.  If Grosvenor should  subsequently  determine,  in accordance with its
then-current  criteria  applicable to the  selection of Portfolio  Funds for the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that  such  a  Portfolio  Fund  is an  appropriate
investment for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and its related persons
will not be  required  to  restructure  the terms on which  they  invest in such
Portfolio Fund in order to make  investments in such Portfolio Fund available to
the Fund if, for  regulatory or other  reasons,  the Fund is (or, in Grosvenor's
reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded  from  investing in such Portfolio
Fund in the absence of such restructuring.

        Grosvenor  and its  related  persons may from time to time  invest,  for
their  respective  proprietary  accounts,  in certain  investment funds that are
administered,  but not advised, by Grosvenor (the "NON-ADVISED  Funds") and from
which  they  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees.  In  many  cases,  such
investments may be made at times when  investments in the Non-Advised  Funds are
not appropriate for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. If Grosvenor should subsequently
determine,  in  accordance  with its  then-current  criteria  applicable  to the
selection of Portfolio  Funds for the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that such a
Non-Advised  Fund  is  an  appropriate   investment  for  the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,   Grosvenor   may   cause   the  Fund   and/or   one  or  more   other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  to invest  in such  Non-Advised  Fund  even  though
Grosvenor  continues  to  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees  from  such
Non-Advised Fund. Moreover,  Grosvenor will not be required to reduce, eliminate
or  restructure  the  administrative  or  similar  fees it  receives  from  such
Non-Advised Fund in order to make investments in such Non-Advised Fund available
to the Fund if, for regulatory or other reasons, the Fund is (or, in Grosvenor's
reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded from investing in such Non-Advised
Fund in the absence of such fee reduction, elimination or restructuring.

        A Grosvenor  portfolio  manager  might have an incentive to favor one or
more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts over the Fund (for example, with regard to the
selection  of  Portfolio  Funds  for  those  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  or the
allocation  of  investment  opportunities  in Portfolio  Funds that have limited
investment capacity), because the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed Accounts might pay
Grosvenor  more  for its  services  than  the  Fund or  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that invest in the Fund.  Similarly,  a Grosvenor portfolio manager may
have an incentive to favor one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts over the Fund
if  such  portfolio  manager  has  a  personal   investment  in  such  "favored"
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  No  assurance  can be given that (i) the Fund will
participate in all investment opportunities in which other client or proprietary
accounts of  Grosvenor  and its related  persons  participate,  (ii)  particular
investment   opportunities  allocated  to  client  or  proprietary  accounts  of
Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  other  than the Fund  will not  outperform
investment  opportunities  allocated to the Fund,  or (iii) the Fund, on the one
hand, and other similarly-situated  client and proprietary accounts of Grosvenor
and its  related  persons,  on the other  hand,  will  receive  equal or similar
treatment.

        Different participants in the same Grosvenor-Managed  Account (including
the Fund),  as well as certain other persons  (including  persons who may have a
direct or indirect  interest in Grosvenor and persons who were  previously,  but
who are not currently,  associated with Grosvenor),  receive reporting  packages
from  Grosvenor  that differ in form,  substance,  timing and/or  frequency.  In
particular,  certain  reporting  packages  may include  information  relating to
Portfolio  Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Fund,
invest (or in which they are contemplating an investment).  Grosvenor ordinarily
does not place  restrictions  on a recipient's  use of such  information,  and a
recipient  could use such  information to invest  directly in Portfolio Funds in
which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Fund, invest (or in which
they are  contemplating  an  investment),  potentially in  competition  with the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Fund.

        Certain of the Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests may hold notes
or other securities issued from time to time by Grosvenor,  and Grosvenor may be
aware that such Portfolio Funds do so. Grosvenor does not
<PAGE>

believe, however, that either of the foregoing circumstances will in any respect
influence Grosvenor's selection of Portfolio Funds.

        The  Investment  Managers  are  likely to be subject to many of the same
types of conflict of interest to which  Grosvenor is subject.  For example,  the
Investment  Managers may be involved in other business  ventures,  including the
management  and/or  administration  of other investment funds and accounts whose
investment  objectives  are identical or  substantially  similar to those of the
Portfolio  Funds.  Neither  the  Fund nor the Fund  will  share in the  risks or
rewards of such other  ventures.  In addition,  such other ventures will compete
with the  relevant  Portfolio  Funds for the time and  attention of the relevant
Investment Managers,  and might create additional conflicts of interest or raise
other special considerations.

        The  Investment  Managers  have  responsibility  for investing the funds
allocated to them. The Investment Managers also manage other accounts (including
other  accounts in which they may have an interest)  and may have  financial and
other  incentives to favor such  accounts over the Portfolio  Funds in which the
Fund invests.  In investing on behalf of other clients, as well as the Portfolio
Funds in which the Fund invests,  the  Investment  Managers must allocate  their
resources, as well as limited market opportunities.  Doing so could increase the
level of competition  for the same trades that  otherwise  might be made for the
Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests,  including  the  priorities of order
entry,  as well as  make it  difficult  or  impossible  to take or  liquidate  a
particular position at a price indicated by an Investment Manager's strategy.

        In  addition,  in  connection  with  investing  and  trading  for  other
accounts, including their proprietary accounts, the Investment Managers may make
use of  information  obtained by them in the course of investing and trading for
the Portfolio  Funds.  They will have no obligation to compensate  the Portfolio
Funds in any respect for their receipt of such  information or to account to any
such Portfolio Fund for any profits earned from their use of such information.

         The Investment  Managers and their principals,  in managing  investment
accounts other than the Portfolio Funds,  may employ trading  methods,  policies
and  strategies  which  differ  from those  which they  employ on behalf of such
Portfolio  Funds.  Therefore,  the  results  of the Fund's  investments  in such
Portfolio  Funds may differ from the results of other  accounts  managed by such
Investment Managers.

        The Investment Managers value the illiquid, longer-term investments held
by their Portfolio  Funds in a variety of different ways, and have  considerable
discretion in doing so. The  Investment  Managers have a conflict of interest in
arriving  at such  valuations,  which  affect  both  the  performance  of  their
Portfolio  Funds  and  the  advisory  compensation  received  by the  Investment
Managers.

        The  Investment  Managers  have a conflict  of  interest  in  allocating
capital to longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments.  While such positions may
hold  significant  profit potential (and,  therefore,  the potential to generate
substantial  incentive  compensation),  they can create  material  valuation and
illiquidity risks for investors. In addition, performance fees may be calculated
separately  in  respect  of  certain  longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments
irrespective of the overall performance of a Portfolio Fund.

There have been no material  changes to the procedures by which the shareholders
may  recommend  nominees to the  registrant's  board of  directors,  where those
changes were  implemented  after the  registrant  last  provided  disclosure  in
response to the  requirements  of Item  407(c)(2)(iv)  of Regulation S-K (17 CFR
229.407) (as required by Item  22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR  240.14a-101)),

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

        this  report,  have  concluded  that such  controls and  procedures  are
        adequately designed to ensure that information  required to be disclosed
        by the registrant in Form N-CSR is accumulated  and  communicated to the
        registrant's  management,  including the principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
        appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

        reporting  (as  defined  in Rule  30a-3(d)  under  the  1940 Act (17 CFR
        270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the  registrant's  second  fiscal
        quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that  has  materially
        affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
        internal control over financial reporting.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITY            Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
                                Item 2 of Form N-CSR

- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT
- ----------------------

Item 2 of Form N-CSR, the form used by registered management investment
companies to file certified shareholder reports, requires a registered
management investment company to disclose (1) whether it has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to the investment company's principal executive officer and
senior financial officers and, if it has not adopted such a code of ethics, why
it has not done so, and (2) any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of
ethics relating to such officers.

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following Code of Ethics, which sets
forth the ethical standards to which the Fund holds its principal executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

FUND LEVEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
- ----------------------------------

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This Code of Ethics (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer or
Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in
          other public communications made by the Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
<PAGE>

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or apparent
conflicts of interest.

II. ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

     The Board has designated an individual to be primarily responsible for the
administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). In the absence of the Code
Officer, his or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
temporary basis.

     The Board has designated a person who meets the definition of a chief legal
officer (the "CLO") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
promulgated thereunder as the Fund's CLO. The CLO of the Fund shall assist the
Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Code Officer, in
consultation with the CLO, shall be responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations (in consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and
has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.

III. MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's personal
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

     Certain provisions in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Advisers Act and the rules and regulations thereunder govern certain
conflicts of interest that arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and its Adviser's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and conduct that is consistent
with such programs and procedures falls outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationships between the Fund and, as applicable, its Adviser, administrator,
principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
(each, a "Primary Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes

<PAGE>

that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for a Primary Service Provider, or for both), be
involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the Primary Service Providers and the Fund. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationships between the Fund and the Primary Service Providers and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of
the Fund that the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or
more other investment companies or organizations affiliated with the sponsor of
the Fund covered by other similar codes and that the codes of ethics of those
other investment companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers
acting in such capacities for such other investment companies.

     This Code covers conflicts of interest that are not subject to provisions
in the 1940 Act and Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such conflicts of interest follow.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    not knowingly use his or her personal influence or personal
          relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or
          financial reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     o    not knowingly cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,
          for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, rather than the benefit of the Fund;

     o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
          or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to
          trade personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
          transactions; and

     o    report at least annually (or more frequently, as appropriate) known
          affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of
          interest with respect to the Fund.

     If a Covered Officer believes that he or she has a potential conflict of
interest that is likely to materially compromise his or her objectivity or his
or her ability to perform the duties of his or her role as a Covered Officer,
including a potential conflict of interest that arises out of his or her
responsibilities as an officer or employee of one or more Primary Service
Providers or other funds, he or she should consult with the Code Officer, the
CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent Board Members, as
appropriate.

<PAGE>

     Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially compromise
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer and which the
Covered Officer should consider discussing with the Code Officer or other
appropriate person include:

     o    service as a director on the board of a public or private company or
          service as a public official;

     o    the receipt of a non-de minimis gift when the gift is in relation to
          doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

     o    the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Fund has
          current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is
          business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
          place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

     o    an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
          with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the Primary
          Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
          transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
          portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than
          an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

IV.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

     o    to familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
          generally applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and
          financial operations of the Fund;

     o    to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others to
          misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board, legal counsel, legal
          counsel to the Independent Board Members and auditors, and to
          governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility,
          consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the Primary
          Service Providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
          timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
          Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
          communications made by the Fund; and
<PAGE>

     o    to adhere to and, within his or her area of responsibility, promote
          compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

V.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer, acknowledge
          in writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has received, read and
          understands the Code, using the form attached as Appendix I hereto;

     o    annually thereafter acknowledge in writing to the Fund's Board that he
          or she has received and read the Code and believes that he or she has
          complied with the requirements of the Code, using the form attached as
          Appendix II hereto;

     o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify the Code Officer promptly if he or she knows of any violation,
          or of conduct that reasonably could be expected to be or result in a
          violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

     The Fund will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

     o    The Code Officer will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
          investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

     o    If, after such investigation, the Code Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Code Officer will so notify the person(s)
          reporting the potential violation, and no further action is required;

     o    Any matter that the Code Officer, upon consultation with the CLO,
          believes is a violation will be reported by the Code Officer or the
          CLO to the Fund's Audit Committee;

     o    If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
          inform and make a recommendation to the Fund's Board, which will
          consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
          appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to the appropriate personnel of the Fund's Primary
          Service Providers or their boards; a recommendation to censure,
          suspend or dismiss the Covered Officer; or referral of the matter to
          the appropriate authorities for civil action or criminal prosecution;
<PAGE>

     o    The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers,
          as appropriate; and

     o    This Code and any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the
          extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit Committee quarterly any
violations of, or material issues arising under, this Code.

VI.  OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for the
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered management investment companies thereunder. Insofar as
other polices or procedures of the Fund or the Fund's Primary Service Providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent
that they conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Fund's and its
Adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
1940 Act and the more detailed policies and procedures of the Primary Service
Providers as set forth in their respect Compliance Manuals are separate
requirements applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

VII.  AMENDMENTS

     All material amendments to this Code must be in writing and approved or
ratified by the Fund's Board, including a majority of the Independent Board
Members.

VIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code or upon advice of counsel, such
reports and records shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's
Board, the Covered Officers, the Code Officer, the CLO, the Fund's Primary
Service Providers and their affiliates, and outside audit firms, legal counsel
to the Fund and legal counsel to the Independent Board Members and to the
Primary Service Providers and their affiliates.

IX.  RECORDKEEPING

     The Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an easily
accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the Audit
Committee or the Board: (i) that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver
to this Code; and (ii) relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions
imposed for such violation, together with a written record of the approval or
action taken by the Audit Committee and/or Board.

         The CLO is responsible for maintaining (i) a current list of the Fund's
Covered

<PAGE>

Officers and (ii) records of all activities related to this Policy, including
those records required to be maintained by the Fund pursuant to the preceding
paragraph.


X.   INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

XI.   IMPLEMENTATION AND RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

     The Code Officer, in conjunction with the CLO and BAC, shall be responsible
for administration of this Policy and for adopting specific procedures to ensure
compliance with the Fund Level Policies and Procedures set forth herein.

    Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC;

2.  Based on my knowledge,  this report does not contain any untrue statement of
