                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.  (the  "Equity  Trust") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Maryland
corporation on May 20, 1986 and registered  under the Investment  Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  whose primary  objective is long term growth
of capital. Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

      The  Equity  Trust  will  invest  at least  80% of its  assets  in  equity
securities under normal market conditions (the "80% Policy"). The 80% Policy may
be  changed  without  shareholder  approval.   The  Equity  Trust  will  provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Equity Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") so  determines,  by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith, to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close of the foreign  markets,  but prior to the close
of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change
significantly,  certain  foreign  securities  may be  fair  valued  pursuant  to
procedures  established  by the  Board.  Debt  instruments  that are not  credit
impaired  with  remaining  maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost,  unless the Board  determines such amount does not reflect the securities'
fair value, in which case these securities will be valued at their fair value as
determined by the Board. Debt instruments having a maturity greater than 60 days
for which  market  quotations  are  readily  available  are valued at the latest
average of the bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on
such day, the security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts
are valued at the closing  settlement price of the exchange or board of trade on
which the applicable contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board. Fair
valuation  methodologies  and  procedures  may include,  but are not limited to:
analysis and review of available  financial and non-financial  information about
the company;  comparisons  to the  valuation and changes in valuation of similar
securities,  including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S.
dollar value ADR securities at the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of
any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.   The  Equity  Trust  may  enter  into  repurchase
agreements with primary government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal
Reserve  Board,  with member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System or with other
brokers or dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the Adviser and
reviewed by the Board. Under the terms of a typical


                                       14

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
               NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)(UNAUDITED)

repurchase  agreement,  the Equity Trust takes  possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase,  and the Equity
Trust to  resell,  the  obligation  at an  agreed-upon  price and time,  thereby
determining the yield during the Equity Trust's holding period. The Equity Trust
will always  receive and maintain  securities as collateral  whose market value,
including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar amount
invested  by the Equity  Trust in each  agreement.  The  Equity  Trust will make
payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of book
entry transfer of the collateral to the account of the custodian.  To the extent
that any  repurchase  transaction  exceeds one  business  day,  the value of the
collateral is  marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the
collateral.  If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral  declines or
if  bankruptcy  proceedings  are  commenced  with  respect  to the seller of the
security,  realization  of the  collateral by the Equity Trust may be delayed or
limited.

      SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Equity Trust may enter into interest rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Equity  Trust would  agree to pay to the other party to the  interest
rate  swap  (which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate
payment in exchange  for the  counterparty  agreeing to pay to the Equity  Trust
periodically a variable rate payment that is intended to approximate  the Equity
Trust's variable rate payment  obligation on the Series C Preferred Stock. In an
interest rate cap, the Equity Trust would pay a premium to the counterparty and,
to the extent that a specified variable rate index exceeds a predetermined fixed
rate,  would receive from the  counterparty  payments of the difference based on
the  notional  amount  of such  cap.  Interest  rate  swap and cap  transactions
introduce additional risk because the Equity Trust would remain obligated to pay
preferred stock dividends when due in accordance with the Articles Supplementary
even if the counterparty defaulted. If there is a default by the counterparty to
a swap  contract,  the Equity  Trust will be  limited  to  contractual  remedies
pursuant to the  agreements  related to the  transaction.  There is no assurance
that the swap  contract  counterparties  will be able to meet their  obligations
pursuant to the swap  contracts  or that,  in the event of  default,  the Equity
Trust will  succeed in  pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Equity  Trust thus
assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining  payments
owed to it  pursuant to the swap  contracts.  The  creditworthiness  of the swap
contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in order to minimize  this risk.
Depending on the general state of short term  interest  rates and the returns on
the Equity Trust's  portfolio  securities at that point in time,  such a default
could negatively affect the Equity Trust's ability to make dividend payments for
the Series C Preferred Stock. In addition,  at the time an interest rate swap or
cap transaction reaches its scheduled termination date, there is a risk that the
Equity Trust will not be able to obtain a  replacement  transaction  or that the
terms  of  the  replacement  will  not  be  as  favorable  as  on  the  expiring
transaction.  If this  occurs,  it could  have a  negative  impact on the Equity
Trust's ability to make dividend payments on the Series C Preferred Stock.

      The use of derivative  instruments involves, to varying degrees,  elements
of market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability on the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements. Swap
agreements  involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements of market and  counterparty
risk,  and  exposure to loss in excess of the related  amounts  reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

*Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Equity Trust may engage in futures  contracts for
the purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities
and in the value of securities  it intends to purchase.  Such  investments  will
only be made if they are  economically  appropriate  to the  reduction  of risks
involved in the management of the Equity Trust's investments. Upon entering into
a futures  contract,  the Equity Trust is required to deposit with the broker an
amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract
amount. This is known as the "initial margin."  Subsequent payments  ("variation
margin")  are made or received by the Equity  Trust each day,  depending  on the
daily  fluctuation  of the  value of the  contract.  The  daily  changes  in the
contract are included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and
futures contracts.  The Equity Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when the
contract is closed. At June 30, 2005, there were no open futures contracts.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged  investments.  These  contracts may involve market
risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss  reflected  in the  Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.  In addition, there is the risk the Equity Trust may not
be able to enter into a closing  transaction  because of an  illiquid  secondary
market.

      FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Equity Trust may engage in forward
foreign  exchange  contracts for hedging a specific  transaction with respect to
either the currency in which the transaction is denominated or another  currency
as deemed  appropriate by the Adviser.  Forward foreign  exchange  contracts are
valued at the forward rate and are marked-to-market  daily. The change in market
value is included in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and
foreign  currency  translations.  When the contract is closed,  the Equity Trust
records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations  in  the  underlying   prices  of  the  Equity  Trust's   portfolio
securities, but it does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the
future.  Although forward foreign exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due
to a decline in the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential
gain  that  might  result  should  the  value of the  currency  increase.  These
contracts  may  involve  market  risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss
reflected in the Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.  In addition,  the Equity
Trust  could be  exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the  contracts  are
unable to meet the terms of their  contracts.  At June 30,  2005,  there were no
open forward foreign exchange contracts.

      FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The books and records of the Equity Trust
are maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments
and other  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars  at the
exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period,  and purchases and sales of
investment  securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing on the respective  dates of such  transactions.  Unrealized gains and
losses,  which result from changes in foreign  exchange  rates and/or changes in
market  prices of  securities,  have been  included in unrealized


                                       16

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency translations.  Net
realized  foreign  currency gains and losses  resulting from changes in exchange
rates  include  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  between  trade  date  and
settlement  date  on  investment  securities   transactions,   foreign  currency
transactions  and the  difference  between the amounts of interest and dividends
recorded on the books of the Equity Trust and the amounts actually received. The
portion of foreign  currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in exchange
rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is included
in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Equity Trust may directly purchase securities of
foreign  issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves  special
risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The
risks include  possible  revaluation  of  currencies,  the ability to repatriate
funds, less complete  financial  information about companies and possible future
adverse  political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many
foreign  issuers  and their  markets  may be less  liquid and their  prices more
volatile than those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

      DIVIDENDS  AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common
shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and
capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with Federal income tax
regulations which may differ from that determined under U.S.  generally accepted
accounting  principles.   These  differences  are  primarily  due  to  differing
treatments  of income and gains on  various  investment  securities  held by the
Equity   Trust,   timing   differences   and  differing   characterizations   of
distributions made by the Equity Trust.

      Distributions  to  shareholders  of the  Equity  Trust's  7.20%  Series  B
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series C Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock,
5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock ("Cumulative Preferred Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and
are determined as described in Note 5.

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  reclassifications  were made to
decrease   accumulated   net  investment   income  by  $3,816,593  and  decrease
accumulated net realized loss on investments,  futures contracts, swap contracts
and foreign currency transactions by $3,816,593.

      The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31,
2004 was as follows:

taxable income and net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income
taxes is required.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Equity Trust has entered
into an  investment  advisory  agreement  (the  "Advisory  Agreement")  with the
Adviser  which  provides  that the  Equity  Trust  will pay the  Adviser  a fee,
computed weekly and paid monthly, equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value
of the Equity Trust's average weekly net assets including the liquidation  value
of preferred  stock.  In  accordance  with the Advisory  Agreement,  the Adviser
provides a continuous  investment  program for the Equity Trust's  portfolio and
oversees the  administration  of all aspects of the Equity Trust's  business and
affairs.  The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee on the incremental
assets attributable to the Cumulative Preferred Stock if the total return of the
net  asset  value  of  the  common  shares  of  the  Equity   Trust,   including
distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed the stated
dividend  rate or net swap  expense of the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the
fiscal year.

      The  Equity  Trust's  total  return on the net asset  value of the  common
shares is monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the
net asset  value of the  common  shares  exceeds  the  stated  dividend  rate or
corresponding swap rate of each particular series of Cumulative  Preferred Stock
for the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Equity Trust's total
return on the net asset  value of the  common  shares  did not exceed the stated
dividend  rate or net swap expense of all  outstanding  preferred  stock.  Thus,
management  fees with respect to the  liquidation  value of the preferred  stock
assets in the amount of $2,076,504 were not accrued.

      During  the six  months  ended June 30,  2005,  Gabelli &  Company,  Inc.,
("Gabelli & Company") an affiliate of the Adviser, received $94,647 in brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Equity Trust.

      The cost of calculating the Equity Trust's net asset value per share is an
Equity Trust expense pursuant to the Advisory  Agreement.  During the six months
ended  June 30,  2005,  the  Equity  Trust  reimbursed  the  Adviser  $22,500 in
connection with the cost of computing the Equity Trust's net asset value,  which
is included in miscellaneous expenses in the Statement of Operations.

      The Equity  Trust is  assuming  its portion of the  allocated  cost of the
Gabelli  Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer in the amount of $13,938 for the six
months  ended  June 30,  2005,  which is  included  in payroll  expenses  in the
Statement of Operations.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.  Cost of  purchases  and  proceeds  from the sales of
securities,  other than short term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
2005 aggregated $52,897,885 and $57,973,563, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The charter permits the Equity Trust to issue 182,000,000 shares of
common stock (par value  $0.001).  The Board of the Equity Trust has  authorized
the repurchase of its shares on the open market when the shares are trading at a
discount  of 10% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may  determine
from time to time) from the net asset value of the shares. During the six months
ended June 30,  2005,  the  Equity  Trust did not  repurchase  any shares of its
common stock in the open market.

      Transactions in common stock were as follows:

      The Equity Trust's Articles of  Incorporation,  as amended,  authorize the
issuance of up to  18,000,000  shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The Cumulative  Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and results
in the  financial  leveraging  of the common  stock.  Such  leveraging  tends to
magnify both the risks and  opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on
shares of the Cumulative  Preferred  Stock are  cumulative.  The Equity Trust is
required by the 1940 Act and by the Articles Supplementary to meet certain asset
coverage tests with respect to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Equity
Trust fails to meet these  requirements  and does not correct such failure,  the
Equity Trust may be required to redeem,  in part or in full, the 7.20% Series B,
Series C Auction  Rate,  5.875%  Series D, and Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock  at  redemption  prices  of $25,  $25,000,  $25,  and  $25,000,
respectively,  per share  plus an amount  equal to the  accumulated  and  unpaid
dividends  whether  or not  declared  on such  shares  in  order  to meet  these
requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet the foregoing  asset  requirements
could  restrict  the  Equity   Trust's   ability  to  pay  dividends  to  common
shareholders  and could lead to sales of  portfolio  securities  at  inopportune
times.  The income  received on the Equity  Trust's  assets may vary in a manner
unrelated to the fixed and variable  preferred  dividend rates, which could have
either a beneficial or  detrimental  impact on net  investment  income and gains
available to common shareholders.

      On June 17, 2003, the Equity Trust,  as authorized by the Board,  redeemed
all (5,367,900  shares) of its outstanding  7.25% Series A Cumulative  Preferred
Stock, at the redemption  price of $25.00 per Preferred Share (the  "liquidation
value"),  plus accumulated and unpaid  dividends  through the redemption date of
$0.4078 per Preferred  Share.  The Preferred Shares were callable at any time at
the  liquidation  value plus accrued  dividends  following the expiration of the
five-year call protection on June 9, 2003.

      On June 20, 2001, the Equity Trust  received net proceeds of  $159,329,175
(after  underwriting  discounts of $5,197,500 and offering expenses of $473,325)
from the  public  offering  of  6,600,000  shares of 7.20%  Series B  Cumulative
Preferred Stock.  Commencing June 20, 2006 and thereafter,  the Equity Trust, at
its option, may redeem the 7.20% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or
in part at the  redemption  price at any time.  During the six months ended June
30,  2005,  the Equity  Trust did not  repurchase  any shares of 7.20%  Series B
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  At June 30, 2005,  6,600,000  shares of the 7.20%
Series B  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  outstanding  and accrued  dividends
amounted to $132,000.

      On June 27, 2002, the Equity Trust  received net proceeds of  $128,246,557
(after  underwriting  discounts of $1,300,000 and offering expenses of $453,443)
from the public  offering of 5,200  shares of Series C Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is
generally held every 7 days, is expected to vary with short term interest rates.
The dividend rates of Series C Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock ranged
from 2.15% to 3.38%

Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  shareholders  may also  trade  shares in the

Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in whole or in part at the redemption
price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30, 2005,  the Equity Trust

      On October 7, 2003,  the Equity Trust received net proceeds of $72,387,500
(after  underwriting  discounts of $2,362,500 and offering expenses of $264,522)
from the public  offering  of  3,000,000  shares of 5.875%  Series D  Cumulative
Preferred Stock. Commencing October 7, 2008 and thereafter, the Equity Trust, at
its option,  may redeem the 5.875% Series D Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole
or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the six months ended June
30, 2005,  the Equity  Trust did not  repurchase  any shares of 5.875%  Series D
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. At June 30, 2005,  2,949,700  shares of the 5.875%
Series D  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  outstanding  and accrued  dividends
amounted to $48,137.

      On October 7, 2003,  the Equity Trust received net proceeds of $49,260,000
(after  underwriting  discounts of $500,000  and offering  expenses of $149,991)
from the public  offering of 2,000  shares of Series E Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is
generally held every 7 days, is expected to vary with short term interest rates.
The dividend rates of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock ranged
from  2.20%  to  3.36%  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2005.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit  an order to hold,  bid or sell  such  shares  on each
auction date. Series E Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock shareholders may
also trade shares in the secondary market.  The Equity Trust, at its option, may
redeem the Series E Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part
at the redemption price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30, 2005,
the Equity Trust did not redeem any shares of Series E Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  At June 30,  2005,  2,000 shares of the Series E Auction Rate
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of
3.15% and accrued dividends amounted to $30,625.

      The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the holders of common stock (one vote per share) and will vote together
with holders of shares of common stock as a single class. In addition,  the 1940
Act  requires  that along with  approval  of a majority of the holders of common
stock,  approval  of a  majority  of the  holders of any  outstanding  shares of
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization  that would adversely affect the Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security  holders,
including,  among other things, changes in the Equity Trust's  subclassification
as a  closed-end  investment  company or changes in its  fundamental  investment
restrictions.

      The Board has approved the  acquisition  of  substantially  all of the net
assets from Sterling Capital Corporation,  a closed-end investment company, with
the issuance of common stock of the Equity Trust.  The acquisition is subject to
approval by the shareholders of Sterling Capital Corporation.

6. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund  shares  trading  practices.  Gabelli  Asset  Management  Inc.,  the
Adviser's  parent  company,  is responding  to these  requests for documents and
testimony.  The Equity  Trust does not believe  that these  matters  will have a
material adverse effect on the Equity Trust's financial  position or the results
of its operations.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Equity  Trust  enters into  contracts  that contain a
variety of  indemnifications.  The Equity Trust's  maximum  exposure under these
arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Equity Trust has not had prior claims or
losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.

           BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

Section  15(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940
Act"),  contemplates  that the Board of Directors  (the  "Board") of The Gabelli
Equity Trust Inc. (the  "Fund"),  including a majority of the Directors who have
no direct or indirect interest in the investment  advisory agreement and are not
"interested  persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the  "Independent
Directors"),  are required to annually  review and  re-approve  the terms of the
Fund's  existing  investment  advisory  agreement and approve any newly proposed
terms therein.  In this regard,  the Board reviewed and re-approved,  during the
most recent six month period covered by this report,  the  Management  Agreement
(the  "Management  Agreement")  with Gabelli Funds,  LLC (the "Adviser") for the
Fund.

More specifically,  at a meeting held on May 18, 2005, the Board,  including the
Independent  Directors,  considered  the factors  and  reached  the  conclusions
described  below relating to the selection of the Adviser and the re-approval of
the Management Agreement.

NATURE,  EXTENT AND  QUALITY OF  SERVICES.  The Board  received  and  considered
various  data and  information  regarding  the  nature,  extent  and  quality of
administrative  and  shareholder  services  provided  to the Fund by the Adviser
under the Management Agreement,  including portfolio management,  supervision of
Fund  operations  and  compliance  and  regulatory  filings and  disclosures  to
shareholders, general oversight of other service providers, review of Fund legal
issues,  assisting the Independent  Directors in their capacity as Directors and
other  services.  Specifically,  the Board received and  considered  information
regarding  the size,  education  and  experience  of the  Adviser's  staff,  the
Adviser's  fundamental  research  capabilities  and the  Adviser's  approach  to
recruiting,  training and retaining  portfolio  managers and other  research and
management personnel.

Based on the above  factors,  together with those  referenced  below,  the Board
concluded  that the  services  were  extensive  in nature  and that the  Adviser
consistently delivered a high level of service.

FUND PERFORMANCE. The Board reviewed and considered information as to short-term
and long-term  investment  performance for the Fund over various periods of time
as compared to the performance of the Fund's Lipper,  Inc. peer group. The Board
concluded  that the  Adviser was  delivering  satisfactory  performance  results
consistent with the investment strategies being pursued by the Fund.

FUND FEES AND EXPENSES. The Board reviewed and considered the Fund's contractual
management  fee rate and expense  ratio  relative to industry  averages  for the
Fund's peer group  category and the advisory fees charged by the Adviser and its
affiliates to other fund and non-fund clients. The Board noted that the services
provided  under the  Management  Agreement  were much more  extensive than those
under the advisory  agreements for non-fund  clients.  The Board recognized that
the contractual management fee of the Fund was marginally lower than average for
its  peer  group  and  concluded  that  the fee was  acceptable  based  upon the
qualifications,  experience,  reputation and  performance of the Adviser and the
fact that the Fund's overall expense ratio is approximately the same as its peer
group.

PROFITABILITY.  The Board  received and  considered  information  regarding  the
Adviser's  overall  profitability  and costs and an  estimated  analysis  of the
Adviser's  profitability  attributable to the Fund. The Board concluded that the
Adviser's profitability was at an acceptable level.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The Board  received and  considered  information  regarding
whether there have been economies of scale with respect to the management of the
Fund and whether the Fund has  appropriately  benefited  from any  economies  of
scale.  The Board noted that economies of scale may develop for certain funds as
their assets increase and their  fund-level  expenses decline as a percentage of
assets,  but that fund-level  economies of scale may not  necessarily  result in
Adviser-level  economies of scale.  The Board was aware that the Adviser  waives
fees  attributable to the liquidation value of the preferred shares if the total
return of the common  shares does not exceed a specified  amount,  and concluded
that there was an appropriate sharing of economies of scale.

The Board also  considered  whether the  management  fee rate is  reasonable  in
relation  to the  asset  size of the Fund and any  economies  of scale  that may
exist, and concluded that it currently was reasonable.

OTHER  BENEFITS  TO  THE  ADVISER.   The  Board  also  received  and  considered
information  regarding  the character  and amount of other  incidental  benefits
received by the Adviser and its affiliates from its  association  with the Fund.
The Board  considered  the  brokerage  commissions  paid to an  affiliate of the
Adviser. The Board concluded that potential "fall-out" benefits that the Adviser
and its  affiliates  may  receive,  such as  affiliated  brokerage  commissions,
greater name  recognition  or  increased  ability to obtain  research  services,
appear to be reasonable.

CONCLUSIONS.  As discussed above, the Board reviewed detailed materials received
from the Adviser as part of the  re-approval  process under Section 15(c) of the
1940 Act.  The Board also  regularly  reviews  and  assesses  the quality of the
services that the Fund receives  throughout the year. In this regard,  the Board
reviews reports of the Adviser at least in each of its regular  meetings,  which
include, among other things, Fund performance reports.

As a part of its decision-making  process,  the Board noted that the Adviser has
managed the Fund since its  inception,  and the Board  believed that a long-term
relationship with a capable,  conscientious  adviser is in the best interests of
the Fund. The Board considered,  generally,  that  shareholders  invested in the
Fund  knowing  that the Adviser  managed  the Fund and  knowing  its  investment
management fee schedule. As such, the Board considered,  in particular,  whether
the Adviser  managed the Fund in accordance  with its investment  objectives and
policies as disclosed to  shareholders.  The Board  concluded  that the Fund was
managed by the Adviser consistent with its investment objectives and policies.

In considering the Management  Agreement,  the Board did not identify any factor
as  all-important  or  all-controlling  and  instead  considered  these  factors
collectively  in light of the Fund's  surrounding  circumstances.  Based on this
review, it was the Board's judgment that shareholders had consistently  received
satisfactory  absolute  and  relative  performance  at  reasonable  fees.  After
considering the  above-described  factors and based on the deliberations and its
evaluation  of  the  information  provided  to  it,  the  Board  concluded  that
re-approval  of the  Management  Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund
and  its  shareholders.  Accordingly,  the  Board  unanimously  re-approved  the
Management Agreement.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It is the policy of The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.  ("Equity  Trust") to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Equity
Trust's Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan authorizes
the Equity Trust to issue shares to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a
capital  gains  distribution  regardless  of whether the shares are trading at a
discount or a premium to net asset  value.  All  distributions  to  shareholders
whose shares are registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested
pursuant to the Plan in additional shares of the Equity Trust. Plan participants
may send their stock certificates to EquiServe Trust Company ("EquiServe") to be
held in their dividend reinvestment account.  Registered shareholders wishing to
receive their distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                          The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.
                                  c/o EquiServe
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan may contact EquiServe at (800) 336-6983.

      SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must
do so in  writing  or by  telephone.  Please  submit  your  request to the above
mentioned  address  or  telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,
address  and  account  number.  The  cost  to  liquidate  shares  is  $2.50  per
transaction as well as the brokerage commission incurred.  Brokerage charges are
expected to be less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      If your  shares  are held in the name of a broker,  bank or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in  your  own  name  your  dividends  will  be   automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in  "street  name"  at  such  participating  institutions  will  have  dividends
automatically   reinvested.   Shareholders  wishing  a  cash  dividend  at  such
institution must contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of shares of Common Stock  distributed to  participants  in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner.  Under the
Plan,  whenever the market price of the Equity  Trust's Common Stock is equal to
or  exceeds  net asset  value at the time  shares are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of Common Stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Equity Trust's Common Stock.  The valuation
date is the dividend or distribution payment date or, if that date is not a NYSE
trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of the Common Stock at
the time of valuation exceeds the market price of the Common Stock, participants
will receive shares from the Equity Trust valued at market price.  If the Equity
Trust should  declare a dividend or capital gains  distribution  payable only in
cash,  EquiServe  will buy Common  Stock in the open  market,  or on the NYSE or
elsewhere,  for the participants' accounts,  except that EquiServe will endeavor
to  terminate  purchases  in the open market and cause the Equity Trust to issue
shares at net asset value if, following the commencement of such purchases,  the
market value of the Common Stock exceeds the then current net asset value.


                                       25

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

      The Equity  Trust  reserves  the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as
applied to any voluntary  cash  payments  made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan
at least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by EquiServe on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase  their  investment  in the Equity  Trust.  In order to
participate in the Voluntary Cash Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have their
shares registered in their own name and participate in the Dividend Reinvestment
Plan.

Participants  in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan have the  option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe  for  investments  in the Equity  Trust's
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  EquiServe will use these funds to purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  EquiServe  will charge each
shareholder  who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata  share of the  brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary  cash payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43010,  Providence,  RI
02940-3010  such that  EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately  10 days
before the  investment  date.  Funds not  received at least five days before the
investment  date shall be held for  investment  until the next purchase  date. A
payment may be  withdrawn  without  charge if notice is received by EquiServe at
least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Equity Trust.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material  changes to the procedures by which the shareholders
may  recommend  nominees to the  registrant's  Board of  Directors,  where those
changes were  implemented  after the  registrant  last  provided  disclosure  in
response to the  requirements  of Item  7(d)(2)(ii)(G)  of Schedule  14A (17 CFR
240.14a-101), or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
          or persons  performing  similar  functions,  have  concluded  that the
          registrant's  disclosure  controls and  procedures (as defined in Rule
          30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended (the
          "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective,  as of a date within
          90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the  disclosure

          controls and  procedures  required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR  270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b)  or  15d-15(b)  under the
          Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR  240.13a-15(b) or
          240.15d-15(b)).

          financial  reporting (as defined in Rule  30a-3(d)  under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

I, Bruce N. Alpert, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material

     a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule  30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over  financial  reporting  (as defined in Rule 30a-3 (d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  Designed such internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or caused
          such internal  control over  financial  reporting to be designed under
          our  supervision,   to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
          reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

<PAGE>

     (c)  Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures,  as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this  report  based on such
          evaluation; and

     (d)  Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during the second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
