The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging through borrowings or
issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept
of leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained
from leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

Announcement of Annual Stockholders Meeting

The Fund has determined that its annual stockholders meeting originally
scheduled to be held in April 2007 will be postponed and will be held in
September 2007. Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the
meeting must be received by the Fund by May 15, 2007 for inclusion in the Fund's
proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. The persons named as proxies
in the proxy materials for the Fund's 2007 annual meeting of stockholders may
exercise discretionary authority with respect to any stockholder proposal
presented at such meeting if written notice of such proposal has not been
received by the Fund by July 1, 2007. Written proposals and notices should be
sent to the Secretary of the Fund, 800 Scudders Mill Road, Plainsboro, New
Jersey 08536.

A Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder

The new year began on a positive note for most financial markets, continuing the
momentum from the fourth quarter of 2006. At the end of February, however,
global equity markets registered their first significant decline since last
summer. The market jitters were triggered by a significant setback in the
Chinese market and were exacerbated by several concerns, notably a weakening
economy, some disappointing corporate earnings announcements, geopolitical
concerns related to Iran's nuclear program and increasing delinquencies in the
subprime mortgage market. Despite the recent spate of volatility, underlying
stock market fundamentals appear quite sound, supported by a generally good
global economic backdrop, tame inflation, relatively low interest rates and
attractive valuations.

Not unlike the equity market, the bond market also has seen volatility recently
as observers have attempted to interpret mixed economic signals. A bond market
rally late last year reversed early in 2007 as the economic data strengthened.
Prices improved (and yields fell) again in February as equities struggled.
Notably, the Treasury curve remained inverted for much of 2006 and into 2007.
The 30-year Treasury yield stood at 4.68% on February 28, 2007, while the
one-month Treasury offered the highest yield on the curve at 5.24%.

For its part, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has left the target short-term
interest rate on hold at 5.25% since first pausing on August 8, 2006. Although
the central bankers continue to express concern about potential inflationary
pressures, they also have made reference to signs of economic weakness in their
public statements. Most observers expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold
for now, but acknowledge that the combination of a mild economic slowdown and
moderating inflation could prompt an interest rate cut later in 2007.

Notwithstanding the volatility along the way, most major market indexes managed
to post positive returns for the annual and semi-annual reporting periods ended
February 28, 2007:

If the recent market movements are any guide, 2007 could be a year of enhanced
market volatility. As you navigate the uncertainties of the financial markets,
we encourage you to review your investment goals with your financial
professional and to make portfolio changes, as needed. We thank you for trusting
BlackRock with your investment assets, and we look forward to continuing to
serve you in the months and years ahead.

                                               Sincerely,


                                               /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Managers

      The Fund's return outpaced that of its composite benchmark for the fiscal
year, benefiting from both an overweight exposure to lower-tier credits, as well
as its use of leverage.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the 12-month period ended February 28, 2007, the Common Stock of BlackRock
Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 9.38% and 9.03%, based
on a year-end per share net asset value of $7.01 and a per share market price of
$7.28, respectively, and $.658 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +15.35%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $6.69 to $7.01, and assuming
reinvestment of all distributions. The Fund's total return for the period
significantly outpaced the +9.95% return of its benchmark, which is an equal
blend of the Credit Suisse High Yield Index and the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan
Index.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2007, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +9.55%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $6.72 to $7.01, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions. The
blended benchmark returned +6.39% for the six-month period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of distributions, please refer to the Financial Highlights section
of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the
secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a
result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the
Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based
on changes in the Fund's net asset value.

The leveraged loan market, as measured by the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan
Index, returned +7.57% for the annual period, while the high yield bond market,
as measured by the Credit Suisse High Yield Index, returned +12.36%. Despite
some volatility late in the reporting period, the non-investment grade markets
continued to post strong results. The leveraged loan market posted positive
returns in all of the past 12 months, while the high yield market saw positive
returns in 11 of the past 12 months. The markets have been aided by the
continuation of historically low default rates and strong inflows into the asset
classes, both of which have helped to support the prices of the underlying
issues.

Support for the leveraged loan market also came from soaring investor demand,
which pushed spreads to new lows. The primary driver of this demand is
collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which now account for approximately
two-thirds of the leveraged loan market. The cost of funding for these CLOs has
dropped dramatically over the past few years, enabling the structured finance
vehicles to absorb bank loans at increasingly tighter spreads and still achieve
their targeted equity returns. The fact that default rates are at historic lows
also has assisted this trend. To supply the CLO juggernaut, the demand for bank
loans has been so voracious that we've actually seen bond deals migrate to the
loan market, a reversal of historic flows that typically saw deals move from
loans into bonds. This trend has marginally curtailed the supply of high yield
bonds, keeping spreads there tighter than they otherwise would be.

What factors most influenced Fund performance?

The Fund benefited from its overweight exposure to floating rate high yield
bonds and bank loans as opposed to fixed rate high yield issues, in light of the
inverted yield curve. The Fund's overweight to lower-tier credits, particularly
B-rated and CCC-rated issues, aided performance, as these segments of the
non-investment grade market generated the strongest returns. In addition, the
Fund continued to make extensive use of its leverage line, with an average level
of roughly 30% of total assets. This, too, was beneficial to performance. (For a
complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, refer to page 2 of
this report to shareholders.)

What changes were made to the Fund during the period?

During the period, BlackRock, Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill
Lynch") combined Merrill Lynch's investment management business, Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers, L.P. and its affiliates, including Fund Asset Management,
L.P., with BlackRock, Inc. to form a new independent company. While this
resulted in some additions to the portfolio management team, there was no change
in the overall investment philosophy or focus of the Fund.

The Fund increased allocations to certain lower-quality credit tiers.
Specifically, the portfolio's position in B-rated and CCC-rated credits was
increased to an overweight, reflecting efforts to take advantage of the strong
high yield markets in which lower-tier credits provided the greatest returns.
The most notable shift in sector exposures was in the automotive sector, where
we reduced our underweighting during the period.

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

While volatility picked up at the end of the period, resulting in an investor
flight to quality, fundamental and technical valuations remained favorable for
the leveraged loan and high yield markets. Even with the noise at the end of the
reporting period, the leveraged loan market posted a return of .74% in February,
while the high yield market posted a return of better than 1%. This marked the
seventh month out of eight in which the Credit Suisse High Yield Index posted
monthly returns in excess of 1% and the eighth consecutive month that the Credit
Suisse Leveraged Loan Index posted returns of at least +.50%. Market
fundamentals remain very strong, with default rates near historical lows and a
new-issue calendar that is just beginning to satisfy the non-investment grade
investor. As a result, we remain positioned with an overweight exposure to
lower-tier credits (B and CCC), as we expect these segments of the market to
post the strongest returns.

By and large, borrowers continue to have access to strong liquidity, another
force keeping default rates low. Moreover, earnings are expected to grow
strongly over the near-term. In our view, with such conditions in place for the
bank loan market, investors appear encouraged and ready to support new deals and
further spread tightening in the sector.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

On September 29, 2006, Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. was renamed BlackRock Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including floating rate loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and
other financial institutions, the Fund's investment in floating rate loans could
be considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Floating rate loans are valued in accordance
with guidelines established by the Fund's Board of Directors. As of October 2,
2006, floating rate loan interests are valued at the mean between the last
available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan
Pricing Corporation. Previously floating rate loan interests were valued at the
mean between the last available bid and asked prices as obtained from the same
pricing source. This change had no significant effect on the valuation of these
loans. For the limited number of floating rate loans for which no reliable price
quotes are available, such floating rate loans will be valued by Loan Pricing
Corporation through the use of pricing matrixes to determine valuations. If the
pricing service does not provide a value for floating rate loans, BlackRock
Advisors, LLC (the "Manager"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc., will value the floating rate loans at fair value, which is
intended to approximate market value.

Debt securities are traded primarily in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market and
are valued at the last available bid price in the OTC market or on the basis of
values obtained by a pricing service. Pricing services use valuation matrixes
that incorporate both dealer-supplied valuations and valuation models. The
procedures of the pricing service and its valuations are reviewed by the
officers of the Fund under the general direction of the Board of Directors. Such
valuations and procedures will be reviewed periodically by the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

Securities held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the NASDAQ
Global Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price on the
exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business on the
day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last available
bid price for long positions, and at the last available asked price for short
positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one exchange, the
securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or
under the authority of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Long positions in
securities traded in the OTC market, NASDAQ Capital Market or Bulletin Board are
valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained from one or
more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.
Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued at the last
available asked price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in the OTC
market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most
representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the premium
received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an equivalent
liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to reflect the
current market value of the option written, based on the last sale price in the
case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded in the OTC
market, the last asked price. Options purchased by the Fund are valued at their
last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of
options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. Swap agreements are valued
based upon quoted fair valuations received daily by the Fund from a pricing
service or counterparty. Other investments, including futures contracts and
related options, are stated at market value. Obligations with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the Manager
believes that this method no longer produces fair valuations. Valuation of other
short-term investment vehicles is generally based on the net asset value of the
underlying investment vehicle or amortized cost. Repurchase agreements will be
valued at cost plus accrued interest.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. government securities,
money market instruments and certain fixed income securities, is substantially
completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE.
The values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign currency exchange rates
will generally be determined as of the close of business on the NYSE.
Occasionally, events


20         BLACKROCK DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.         FEBRUARY 28, 2007
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

affecting the values of such securities and such exchange rates may occur
between the times at which they are determined and the close of business on the
NYSE that may not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's net asset value.
If events (for example, a company announcement, market volatility or a natural
disaster) occur during such periods that are expected to materially affect the
value of such securities, those securities will be valued at their fair value as
determined in good faith by the Fund's Board of Directors or by the Manager
using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such financial futures contracts.
      Financial futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of
      securities at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield.
      Upon entering into a contract, the Fund deposits, and maintains as
      collateral, such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the
      transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
      receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
      fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
      as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
      losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time
      it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
      marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
      written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
      option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted
      from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to)
      the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund
      enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on
      the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss
      to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid
      or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts
      in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments
      on a specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set
      period of time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The
      net periodic payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate;
      the change in market value of a specified security, basket of securities,
      or index; or the return generated by a security. These periodic payments
      received or made by the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of
      Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are
      also realized upon termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are
      marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.
The Fund invests in foreign securities, which may involve a number of risk
factors and special considerations not present with investments in securities of
U.S. corporations.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to reg-


         BLACKROCK DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.         FEBRUARY 28, 2007       21

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

ulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Under the applicable foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed
on interest, dividends and capital gains at various rates.

(f) Recent accounting pronouncements -- In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."
FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in
connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or
expected to be taken by an entity including mutual funds before being measured
and recognized in the financial statements. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for
the last net asset value calculation in the first required financial statement
reporting period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact
on the Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS 157
and its impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been
determined.

In addition, in February 2007, FASB issued "Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities" ("FAS 159"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal
year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects
to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. At this time, management is evaluating
the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on the Fund's financial statements,
if any, has not been determined.

(g) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(h) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(i) Securities lending -- The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least
100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market value of
the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business
day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the loaned securities,
it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically receives the income on
the loaned securities but does not receive the income on the collateral. Where
the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such collateral and retain the
amount earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the borrower.
Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the borrower, after notice,
is required to return borrowed securities within five business days. The Fund
may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in
connection with its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its
obligation to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access to the
collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral
falls below the market value of the borrowed securities, in the event of
borrower default or in the event of losses on investments made with cash
collateral.

(j) Reclassifications -- U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require
that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent
differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly, during the current
year, $27,376,921 has been reclassified between paid-in capital in excess of par
and accumulated net realized capital losses, and $27,448 has been reclassified
between undistributed net investment income and accumulated net realized capital
losses as a result of permanent differences attributable to expiration of
capital loss carryforwards, amortization methods on fixed income securities,
securities in default, and foreign currency transactions. These
reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset values per share.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

On September 29, 2006, BlackRock, Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill
Lynch") combined Merrill Lynch's investment management business, Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers, L.P. ("MLIM"), and its affiliates, including Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("), with BlackRock, Inc. to create a new independent company.
Merrill Lynch has a 49.8% economic interest and a 45% voting interest in the
combined company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., has approximately a
34% economic and voting interest. The new company operates under the BlackRock
name and is governed by a board of directors with a majority of independent
members.

On August 15, 2006, shareholders of the Fund approved a new Investment Advisory
Agreement with BlackRock Advisors, Inc. which was reorganized into a limited
liability company and renamed BlackRock Advisors, LLC. The new Investment
Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Manager became effective on
September 29, 2006. Prior to September 29, 2006, FAM was the Fund's Manager. The
general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, which is the limited partner.

The Manager is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average daily net
assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage. In
addition, the Manager has entered into a Sub-Advisory Agreement with BlackRock
Financial Management, Inc., an affiliate of the Manager, under which the Manager
pays the Sub-Adviser for services it provides a monthly fee that is a percentage
of the management fee paid by the Fund to the Manager.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, an affiliate of the Manager, or its affiliates.
Pursuant to that order, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investment Management,
LLC ("BIM"), an affiliate of the Manager, as the securities lending agent for a
fee based on a share of the returns on investment of cash collateral. Prior to
September 29, 2006, BIM was organized as Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, LLC
("MLIM, LLC"), an affiliate of FAM, and MLIM, LLC was the securities lending
agent. BIM may, on behalf of the Fund, invest cash collateral received by the
Fund for such loans, among other things, in a private investment company managed
by the Manager or in registered money market funds advised by the Manager or its
affiliates.

For the year ended February 28, 2007, the Fund reimbursed FAM and the Manager
$9,090 and $5,700, respectively, for certain accounting services.

Prior to September 29, 2006, certain officers and/or directors of the Fund were
officers and/or directors of FAM, PSI, MLIM, Merrill Lynch, and/or MLIM, LLC.

Commencing September 29, 2006, certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are
officers and/or directors of BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales (including paydowns) of investments, excluding short-term
securities, for the year ended February 28, 2007 were $696,506,938 and
$646,993,553, respectively.

4. Stock Transactions:

The Fund is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value
$.10 per share, all of which were initially classified as Common Stock. The
Board of Directors is authorized, however, to classify and reclassify any
unissued shares of capital stock without approval of the holders of Common
Stock.

Shares issued and outstanding during the years ended February 28, 2007 and
February 28, 2006 increased by 579,550 and 252,856, respectively, as a result of
dividend reinvestment.

5. Unfunded Loan Commitments:

As of February 28, 2007, the Fund had unfunded loan commitments of approximately
$5,988,000, which would be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to
the following loan agreements:

                                                                  (in Thousands)

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

On May 22, 2006, the Fund renewed its revolving credit and security agreement
funded by a commercial paper asset securitization program with Citicorp North
America, Inc. ("Citicorp") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and
certain asset securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The agreement
was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $370,000,000. Under the
Citicorp program, the conduits will fund advances to the Fund through the
issuance of highly rated commercial paper. As security for its obligations to
the Lenders under the revolving securitization facility, the Fund has granted a
security interest in substantially all of its assets to and in favor of the
Lenders. The interest rate on the Fund's borrowings is based on the interest
rate carried by the commercial paper plus a program fee. The Fund pays
additional borrowing costs including a backstop commitment fee.

The weighted average annual interest rate was 5.48% and the average borrowing
was approximately $283,906,000 for the year ended February 28, 2007.

7. Distribution to Shareholders:

The Fund paid an ordinary income dividend in the amount of $.053000 per share on
March 30, 2007 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2007. The tax character of
distributions paid during the fiscal years ended February 28, 2007 and February
28, 2006 was as follows:


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    2/28/2007         2/28/2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income ................................ $68,729,202       $68,179,612

                                                   =============================

As of February 28, 2007, the components of accumulated losses on a tax basis
were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undistributed ordinary income -- net ....................       $   8,019,647
Undistributed long-term capital gains -- net ............                  --
                                                                -------------
Total undistributed earnings -- net .....................           8,019,647
Capital loss carryforward ...............................        (310,688,248)*
Unrealized gains -- net .................................           7,970,918**
                                                                -------------
Total accumulated losses -- net .........................       $(294,697,683)
                                                                =============

*     On February 28, 2007, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $310,688,248, of which $51,234,056 expires in 2008, $21,442,332 expires in
      2009, $90,564,493 expires in 2010, $85,285,305 expires in 2011,
      $17,223,475 expires in 2012, $21,126,025 expires in 2013, $20,233,987
      expires in 2014 and $3,578,575 expires in 2015. This amount will be
      available to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.

**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized gains is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
      difference between book and tax amortization methods for premiums and
      discounts on fixed income securities, book/tax differences in the accrual
      of income on securities in default, the deferral of post-October capital
      losses for tax purposes and other book/tax temporary differences.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund,
Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and capital,
including the schedule of investments, of BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.
(formerly Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.) as of February 28, 2007, and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of February 28, 2007, by correspondence with the
custodian and financial intermediaries; where replies were not received from
financial intermediaries, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. as of February 28, 2007, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and its financial
highlights for the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

How the Plan Works -- The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by the Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the shareholders by The Bank of New York
(the "Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Fund declares a dividend,
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the participant's
account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized shares
of the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares of
Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset value per share is equal to
or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage commissions (a
condition often referred to as a "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest
the dividend amount in newly issued shares. If the Fund's net asset value per
share is greater than the market price per share (a condition often referred to
as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount by
purchasing on the open market additional shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend amount in open market purchases, or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent
will invest any uninvested portion in newly issued shares. The shares acquired
are credited to each shareholder's account. The amount credited is determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by either (i) when the shares are
newly issued, the net asset value per share on the date the shares are issued or
(ii) when shares are purchased in the open market, the average purchase price
per share.

Participation in the Plan -- Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Fund unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time
without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan -- The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants
in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they could otherwise
purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received. However, there may not be enough shares
available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem shares, the price on resale
may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees -- There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders will
pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications -- The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore, income and
capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not receive
cash. Participation in the Plan generally will not affect the tax-exempt status
of exempt interest dividends paid by the Fund. If, when the Fund's shares are
trading at a market premium, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that
have a greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is
possible that all or a portion of the discount from the market value (which may
not exceed 5% of the fair market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as
a taxable distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it
is also possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable
to all the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the
Plan. Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information -- All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The Bank of
New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY 10286-1258,

         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
         Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the

         The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
         pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board meeting.

Item 7 - Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
         Management Investment Companies -

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors has delegated to the Manager authority
         to vote all proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio securities. The
         Manager has adopted policies and procedures (the "Proxy Voting
         Procedures") with respect to the voting of proxies related to the
         portfolio securities held in the account of one or more of its clients,
         including a Fund. Pursuant to these Proxy Voting Procedures, the
         Manager's primary objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting
         decisions solely in the best interests of each Fund and its
         shareholders, and to act in a manner that the Manager believes is most
         likely to enhance the economic value of the securities held by the
         Fund. The Proxy Voting Procedures are designed to ensure that the
         Manager considers the interests of its clients, including each Fund,
         and not the interests of the Manager, when voting proxies and that real
         (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Manager's
         interest and those of the Manager's clients are properly addressed and
         resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Manager has
         formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The Committee, which
         is a subcommittee of the Manager's Equity Investment Policy Oversight
         Committee ("EIPOC"), is comprised of a senior member of the Manager's
         equity management group who is also a member of EIPOC, one or more
         other senior investment professionals appointed by EIPOC, portfolio
         managers and investment analysts appointed by EIPOC and any other
         personnel EIPOC deems appropriate. The Committee will also include two
         non-voting representatives from the Manager's Legal Department
         appointed by the Manager's General Counsel. The Committee's membership
         shall be limited to full-time employees of the Manager. No person with
         any investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Manager's affiliates may serve as a member of

<PAGE>

         the Committee or participate in its decision making (except to the
         extent such person is asked by the Committee to present information to
         the Committee on the same basis as other interested knowledgeable
         parties not affiliated with the Manager might be asked to do so). The
         Committee determines how to vote the proxies of all clients, including
         a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting authority to the Manager and
         seeks to ensure that all votes are consistent with the best interests
         of those clients and are free from unwarranted and inappropriate
         influences. The Committee establishes general proxy voting policies for
         the Manager and is responsible for determining how those policies are
         applied to specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique
         structure, management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances,
         probable economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate
         actions. In so doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular
         proxy in a manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In
         addition, the Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all
         reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are
         fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The Manager
         believes that certain proxy voting issues require investment analysis -
         such as approval of mergers and other significant corporate
         transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are, therefore, not
         suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect to adopt a
         common position for the Manager on certain proxy votes that are akin to
         investment decisions, or determine to permit the portfolio manager to
         make individual decisions on how best to maximize economic value for a
         Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment decisions made by such
         portfolio managers). While it is expected that the Manager will
         generally seek to vote proxies over which the Manager exercises voting
         authority in a uniform manner for all the Manager's clients, the
         Committee, in conjunction with a Fund's portfolio manager, may
         determine that the Fund's specific circumstances require that its
         proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Manager in voting proxies, the Committee has retained
         Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an independent
         adviser that specializes in providing a variety of fiduciary-level
         proxy-related services to institutional investment managers, plan
         sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other institutional investors.
         The services provided to the Manager by ISS include in-depth research,
         voting recommendations (although the Manager is not obligated to follow
         such recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Manager's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Manager generally will
         not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities that are on
         loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In addition,
         the Manager will vote proxies related to securities of foreign issuers
         only on a best efforts basis and may elect not to vote at all in
         certain countries where the Committee determines that the costs
         associated with voting generally outweigh the benefits. The Committee
         may at any time override these general policies if it determines that
         such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

         From time to time, the Manager may be required to vote proxies in
         respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Manager (each, an
         "Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Manager,
         including investment companies for which the Manager provides
         investment advisory, administrative and/or other services (each, a

<PAGE>

         "Client"), is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Manager's
         adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts of
         interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
         Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates
         and Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter
         that is material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved
         such that the Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to
         follow its guidelines (or if the particular proxy matter is not
         addressed by the guidelines) and vote impartially, the Committee may,
         in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring that an independent
         determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to advise the
         Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Manager's
         clients.

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the Committee may pass the voting power to a subcommittee,
         appointed by EIPOC (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by EIPOC. EIPOC shall
         appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons whose job
         responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and whose job
         evaluations would not be affected by the Manager's relationship with
         the Client (or failure to retain such relationship). The subcommittee
         shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on behalf of the
         Manager's clients or, if the proxy matter is, in their judgment, akin
         to an investment decision, to defer to the applicable portfolio
         managers, provided that, if the subcommittee determines to alter the
         Manager's normal voting guidelines or, on matters where the Manager's
         policy is case-by-case, does not follow the voting recommendation of
         any proxy voting service or other independent fiduciary that may be
         retained to provide research or advice to the Manager on that matter,
         no proxies relating to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or
         in the Secretary's absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee
         concurs that the subcommittee's determination is consistent with the
         Manager's fiduciary duties.

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Manager has
         adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring proxy
         issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances. These
         policies are guidelines only, and the Manager may elect to vote
         differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting guideline if
         the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best interest to do so.
         In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any time upon the
         request of a Committee member and may be amended or deleted upon the
         vote of a majority of Committee members present at a Committee meeting
         at which there is a quorum.

         The Manager has adopted specific voting guidelines with respect to the
         following proxy issues:

         o Proposals related to the composition of the board of directors of
         issuers other than investment companies. As a general matter, the
         Committee believes that a company's board of directors (rather than
         shareholders) is most likely to have access to important, nonpublic
         information regarding a company's business and prospects, and is,
         therefore, best-positioned to set corporate policy and oversee
         management. The Committee, therefore, believes that the foundation of
         good corporate governance is the election of qualified, independent
         corporate directors who are likely to diligently represent the
         interests of shareholders and oversee management of the corporation in
         a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over time. In
         individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's number of other
         directorships, history of representing shareholder interests as a
         director of other companies or other factors, to the extent the
         Committee deems relevant.

<PAGE>

         o Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent
         auditors. As a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate
         auditors have a responsibility to represent the interests of
         shareholders and provide an independent view on the propriety of
         financial reporting decisions of corporate management. While the
         Committee will generally defer to a corporation's choice of auditor, in
         individual cases, the Committee may look at an auditors' history of
         representing shareholder interests as auditor of other companies, to
         the extent the Committee deems relevant.

         o Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits.
         As a general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
         compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation,
         but believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by
         an issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
         "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
         restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not
         be supported.

         o Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for
         approval of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure.
         As a general matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance
         the rights of common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be
         unreasonably dilutive.

         o Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an
         issuer's charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes
         poison pill provisions.

         o Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
         corporate meetings.

         o Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
         investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the
         Committee believes that a fund's board of directors (rather than its
         shareholders) is best positioned to set fund policy and oversee
         management. However, the Committee opposes granting boards of directors
         authority over certain matters, such as changes to a fund's investment
         objective, which the Investment Company Act envisions will be approved
         directly by shareholders.

         o Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
         relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
         Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
         inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and
         opposes shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or
         requesting release of information that would not help a shareholder
         evaluate an investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While
         the Committee is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate
         disclosure of matters that seem relevant and material to the economic
         interests of shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of
         proposals to require disclosure of corporate matters for other
         purposes.

         of February 28, 2007.

<PAGE>

         (a)(1) The Fund is managed by a team of investment professionals that
         is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio.
         The lead members of this team are Mark J. Williams, Managing Director
         at BlackRock, and Kevin J. Booth, Managing Director at BlackRock. Mr.
         Williams and Mr. Booth each has been a portfolio manager of the Fund

         Mr. Williams is the head of BlackRock's bank loan group and a member of

         and sourcing of mezzanine investments. Prior to joining BlackRock in
         1998, Mr. Williams spent eight years with PNC Bank's New York office
         and was a founding member of the bank's Leveraged Finance Group. In
         that capacity he was responsible for structuring proprietary middle
         market leveraged deals and sourcing and evaluating broadly syndicated
         leveraged loans in the primary and secondary markets for PNC Bank's
         investment portfolio. From 1984 until 1990, Mr. Williams worked in PNC
         Bank's Philadelphia office in a variety of marketing and corporate
         finance positions.

         Mr. Booth is a member of BlackRock's bank loan group. He joined
         BlackRock in 2006. Prior to joining BlackRock, Mr. Booth was a Managing
         Director (Global Fixed Income) of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers,
         L.P. ("MLIM") since 2006 and a member of MLIM's bank loan group from
         2000 to 2006. He was a Director of MLIM from 2000 to 2006 and was a
         Vice President of MLIM from 1994 to 2000. He has been portfolio manager
         with BlackRock or MLIM since 2000.

         (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest

         BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
         compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
         protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
         another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address the
         allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
         transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
         conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
         accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
         furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
         clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with

<PAGE>

         applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
         accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have performance
         or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio managers have a
         personal interest in the receipt of such fees), which may be the same
         as or different from those made to the Fund. In addition, BlackRock,
         its affiliates and any officer, director, stockholder or employee may
         or may not have an interest in the securities whose purchase and sale
         BlackRock recommends to the Fund. BlackRock, or any of its affiliates,
         or any officer, director, stockholder, employee or any member of their
         families may take different actions than those recommended to the Fund
         by BlackRock with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock
         may refrain from rendering any advice or services concerning securities
         of companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
         directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
         which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors and
         employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest or
         possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager also
         may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be opposed
         to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection, it should be
         noted that certain portfolio managers currently manage certain accounts
         that are subject to performance fees. In addition, certain portfolio
         managers assist in managing certain hedge funds and may be entitled to
         receive a portion of any incentive fees earned on such funds and a
         portion of such incentive fees may be voluntarily or involuntarily
         deferred. Additional portfolio managers may in the future manage other
         such accounts or funds and may be entitled to receive incentive fees.

         As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
         must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
         securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated in a
         manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts to
         allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
         accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
         end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
         investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
         client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve reasonable
         efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock with sufficient
         flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that is consistent with
         the particular investment discipline and client base.

         (a)(3) As of February 28, 2007:

               Compensation Program

               BlackRock's financial arrangements with its portfolio managers,
         its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels
         reflect the value senior management places on key resources.
         Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year
         to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of
         compensation include a base salary, a discretionary bonus,
         participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the
         incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock such as its
         Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan and Restricted Stock Program.

               Base Compensation

               Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based on
         their seniority and/or their position with the firm.

<PAGE>

               Discretionary Compensation

               In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers may receive
         discretionary compensation, which can be a substantial portion of total
         compensation. Discretionary compensation can include a discretionary
         cash bonus as well as one or more of the following:

               Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP)

               The LTIP is a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward
         certain key employees. The plan provides for the grant of awards that
         are expressed as an amount of cash that, if properly vested and subject
         to the attainment of certain performance goals, will be settled in cash
         and/or in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.

               Deferred Compensation Program

               A portion of the compensation paid to each portfolio manager may
         be voluntarily deferred by the portfolio manager into an account that
         tracks the performance of certain of the firm's investment products.
         Each portfolio manager is permitted to allocate his deferred amounts
         among various options, including to certain of the firm's hedge funds
         and other unregistered products. In addition, prior to 2005, a portion
         of the annual compensation of certain senior managers was mandatorily
         deferred in a similar manner for a number of years. Beginning in 2005,
         a portion of the annual compensation of certain senior managers was
         paid in the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest
         ratably over a number of years.

               Options and Restricted Stock Awards

               While incentive stock options are not currently being awarded to
         BlackRock employees, BlackRock, Inc. previously granted stock options
         to key employees, including certain portfolio managers who may still
         hold unexercised or unvested options. BlackRock, Inc. also has a
         restricted stock award program designed to reward certain key employees
         as an incentive to contribute to the long-term success of BlackRock.
         These awards vest over a period of years.

               Incentive Savings Plans

               BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans
         in which BlackRock employees are eligible to participate, including a
         401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and the
         BlackRock Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The employer
         contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50%
         of the first 6% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at
         $4,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution equal to 3% of
         eligible compensation, plus an additional contribution of 2% for any
         year in which BlackRock has positive net operating income. The RSP
         offers a range of investment options, including registered investment
         companies managed by the firm. Company contributions follow the
         investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or
         absent, employee investment direction, are invested into a stable value
         fund. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock common stock at a 5%
         discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date.
         Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to the purchase of 1,000
         shares or a dollar value of $25,000. Each portfolio manager is eligible
         to participate in these plans.

               Annual incentive compensation for each portfolio manager is a
         function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the
         performance of the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, the
         investment performance, including risk-adjusted returns and income
         generation, of the firm's assets under management or supervision by
         that portfolio manager relative to predetermined benchmarks, and the
         individual's teamwork and contribution to the overall performance of

<PAGE>

         these portfolios and BlackRock. Unlike many other firms, portfolio
         managers at BlackRock compete against benchmarks rather than each
         other. In most cases, including for the portfolio managers of the
         Registrant, these benchmarks are the same as the benchmark or
         benchmarks against which the investment performance, including
         risk-adjusted returns and income generation, of the Registrant or other
         accounts are measured. A group of BlackRock, Inc.'s officers determines
         which benchmarks against which to compare the performance of funds and
         other accounts managed by each portfolio manager.

               The group of BlackRock, Inc.'s officers then makes a subjective
         determination with respect to the portfolio manager's compensation
         based on the performance of the funds and other accounts managed by
         each portfolio manager relative to the various benchmarks. This
         determination may take into consideration the fact that a benchmark may
         not perfectly correlate to the way the Registrant or other accounts are
         managed, even if it is the benchmark that is most appropriate for the
         Registrant or other account. For example, a benchmark's return may be
         based on the total return of the securities comprising the benchmark,
         but the Registrant or other account may be managed to maximize income
         and not total return. Senior portfolio managers who perform additional
         management functions within BlackRock may receive additional
         compensation for serving in these other capacities.

         (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of February 28, 2007, Mr.
                Booth beneficially owns stock issued by the Fund in the range of
                $50,001 - $100,000. As of February 28, 2007, Mr. Williams does
                not beneficially own any stock issued by the Fund.

         Company and Affiliated Purchasers - Not Applicable

Item 10 - Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders - Not Applicable

Item 11 - Controls and Procedures

11(a) -   The registrant's certifying officers have reasonably designed such
          disclosure controls and procedures to ensure material information
          relating to the registrant is made known to us by others particularly
          during the period in which this report is being prepared. The
          registrant's certifying officers have determined that the registrant's
          disclosure controls and procedures are effective based on our
          evaluation of these controls and procedures as of a date within 90
          days prior to the filing date of this report.

11(b) -   As of September 29, 2006, with the conclusion of the combination of
          Merrill Lynch's asset management business with BlackRock, the
          registrant was migrated to BlackRock's trading and compliance
          monitoring systems, and various personnel changes occurred. In
          conjunction with these business improvements, there were no changes in
          the registrants internal control over financial reporting (as defined
          in Rule 30a-3(d) under Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during
          the last fiscal half-year of the period covered by this report that
          has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
