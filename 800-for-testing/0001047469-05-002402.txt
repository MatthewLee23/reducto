                                 PRIVACY NOTICE

The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial privacy.
Each of the financial institutions identified below has in effect the following
policy ("Privacy Policy") with respect to nonpublic personal information about
its customers:

  - Only such information received from you, through application forms or
    otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will be
    collected. This may include information such as name, address, social
    security, tax status, account balances and transactions.

  - None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed
    to anyone, except as permitted by law (which includes disclosure to
    employees necessary to service your account). In the normal course of
    servicing a customer's account, Eaton Vance may share information with
    unaffiliated third parties that perform various required services such as
    transfer agents, custodians and broker/dealers.

  - Policies and procedures (including physical, electronic and procedural
    safeguards) are in place that are designed to protect the confidentiality of
    such information.

  - We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time upon proper
    notification to you. Customers may want to review our Policy periodically
    for changes by accessing the link on our homepage: www.eatonvance.com.

Our pledge of privacy applies to the following entities within the Eaton Vance
organization: the Eaton Vance Family of Funds, Eaton Vance Management, Eaton
Vance Investment Counsel, Boston Management and Research, and Eaton Vance
Distributors, Inc.

In addition, our Privacy Policy only applies to those Eaton Vance customers who
are individuals and who have a direct relationship with us. If a customer's
account (i.e., fund shares) is held in the name of a third-party financial
adviser/broker-dealer, it is likely that only such adviser's privacy policies
apply to the customer. This notice supersedes all previously issued privacy
disclosures.

            For more information about Eaton Vance's Privacy Policy,
                           please call 1-800-262-1122.

                                IMPORTANT NOTICE
                              REGARDING DELIVERY OF
                              SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

 The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy
 of shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and
 shareholder reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same
 residential or post office box address. This practice is often called
 "householding" and it helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

 EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
 DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
 ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

 If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
 contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

 Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
 documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
 financial adviser.

 The Fund will file a schedule of its portfolio holdings on Form N-Q with the
 Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for the first and third quarters
 of each fiscal year. The Fund's Form N-Q will be available on the Eaton Vance
 website www.eatonvance.com, by calling Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122 or in the
 EDGAR database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Form N-Q may also be
 reviewed and copied at the SEC's public reference room in Washington, D.C.
 (call 1-800-732-0330 for information on the operation of the public reference
 room).

 From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
 held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
 proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds'
 and Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
 procedures and information on how the Fund or Portfolio voted proxies relating
 to portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30 without
 charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This description is also
 available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at

EATON VANCE FLOATING-RATE INCOME TRUST as of November 30, 2004
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF  FUND PERFORMANCE

THE TRUST

  We are pleased to welcome shareholders with this initial shareholder report.

PERFORMANCE FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2004

- - Based on the Trust's November 2004 monthly dividend of $0.094 and a closing
  share price of $18.92, the Trust had a market yield of 5.96%.(1) The Trust's
  market yield represented a yield advantage over many other income-producing
  vehicles during the period.

- - Based on share price (traded on the New York Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
  total return of 0.95% for the period from inception on June 29, 2004 through
  November 30, 2004. That return was the result of a decrease in share price
  from $19.10 on June 29, 2004 to $18.92 on November 30, 2004 and the
  reinvestment of $0.361 in regular monthly dividends.(2)

- - Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 1.80% for the period
  from inception on June 29, 2004 through November 30, 2004. That return was the
  result of a decrease in net asset value per share from $19.10 on June 29, 2004
  to $19.08 on November 30, 2004, and the reinvestment of all distributions.(2)

- - For performance comparison, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index had a return of
  1.88% for the period from June 30, 2004 through November 30, 2004.(3)

  THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS
- - The Trust is a closed-end fund and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. The
  Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income. The
  Trust will, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the
  extent consistent with its primary goal of high current income. The Trust
  invests primarily in senior, secured floating rate loans. The Trust also
  employs leverage in the form of Auction Preferred Shares.(4)

- - The Trust's senior floating-rate loan investments included 279 borrowers,
  ranging across 45 industries at November 30, 2004. The Trust's average loan
  size was just 0.30% of loan assets (based on net assets), and no industry
  constituted more than 11.0% of the Trust's loan investments.
  Telecommunications, health care, containers and glass products, chemicals and
  plastics and leisure goods and activities were the Trust's largest loan
  industry weightings.*

- - The Federal Reserve raised its Federal Funds rate - a short-term interest rate
  benchmark - five times from June 30 through 2004 year-end. With their interest
  rate reset provisions, floating-rate loans have historically generated higher
  income in response to rising short-term rates.

- - Due to improving fundamentals and strong technical factors in the loan market,
  loan credit spreads for new issues narrowed and prices averaged above-par in
  the secondary market. These trends have increased the importance of diligent
  credit risk-management.

- - The Trust's high-yield corporate bond holdings constituted 13.6% of its net
  assets at November 30, 2004 (8.6% of total investments). This component
  provided a yield enhancement for the Trust and performed well during the past
  year.

- - At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
  38% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust uses leverage through the issuance
  of auction preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity
  for increased income, but, at the same time, creates special risks (including
  the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
  common shares).

   * Holdings and sector weightings are subject to change due to active
     management.

  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND
  ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE OR
  SHARE PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. INVESTMENT
  RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY
  BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED
  TIME PERIOD ONLY; DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE TRUST'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE
  MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

  THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND ARE
  CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON THE
  COVER. THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET OR
  OTHER CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH
  VIEWS. THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE
  INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR AN EATON VANCE FUND ARE BASED ON MANY FACTORS, MAY
  NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF OF ANY EATON
  VANCE FUND.

(1)  THE TRUST'S MARKET YIELD IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MOST RECENT DIVIDEND
     PER SHARE BY THE SHARE MARKET PRICE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND
     ANNUALIZING THE RESULT.
(2)  RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE
     CHANGE IN SHARE PRICE OR NET ASSET VALUE, AS APPLICABLE, WITH ALL
     DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. PERFORMANCE RESULTS REFLECT THE EFFECT OF
     LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM THE TRUST'S ISSUANCE OF AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES.
(3)  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INVEST DIRECTLY IN AN INDEX. THE INDEX'S TOTAL RETURN
     DOES NOT REFLECT THE COMMISSIONS OR EXPENSES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED
     IF AN INVESTOR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED OR SOLD THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED IN
     THE INDEX.
(4)  IN THE EVENT OF A RISE IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, THE VALUE OF THE
     TRUST'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE ASSET
     COVERAGE FOR ITS AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES.

TRUST SHARES ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OTHER
OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SHARES ARE SUBJECT
TO INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL INVESTED. YIELD WILL
VARY.

NOTE: THE TRUST HAS MADE COMMITMENTS TO FUND SPECIFIED AMOUNTS UNDER CERTAIN
EXISTING CREDIT ARRANGMENTS. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE
TRUST HAD UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS OF $4,433,095 AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2004.

(1)  SENIOR FLOATING-RATE INTERESTS OFTEN REQUIRE PREPAYMENTS FROM EXCESS CASH
     FLOWS OR PERMIT THE BORROWER TO REPAY AT ITS ELECTION. THE DEGREE TO WHICH
     BORROWERS REPAY, WHETHER AS A CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENT OR AT THEIR ELECTION,
     CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH ACCURACY. AS A RESULT, THE ACTUAL REMAINING
     MATURITY MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE STATED MATURITIES SHOWN.
     HOWEVER, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE INTERESTS WILL
     HAVE AN EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE
     STATED INTEREST RATE REPRESENTS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF ALL
     CONTRACTS WITHIN THE SENIOR LOAN FACILITY. INTEREST RATES ARE PERIODICALLY
     PREDETERMINED BY A REFERENCE TO A BASE LENDING RATE PLUS A PREMIUM. THESE
     BASE LENDING RATES ARE GENERALLY (i) THE PRIME RATE OFFERED BY ONE OR MORE
     MAJOR UNITED STATES BANKS OR (ii) THE LENDING RATE OFFERED BY ONE OR MORE
     EUROPEAN BANKS SUCH AS THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR).

(2)  SECURITY EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER RULE 144A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF
     1933. THESE SECURITIES MAY BE SOLD IN TRANSACTIONS EXEMPT FROM
     REGISTRATION, NORMALLY TO QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS. AT NOVEMBER 30,
     2004, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IS $48,503,217 OR 6.8% OF THE
     TRUST'S NET ASSETS.

(3)  DEFAULTED SECURITY.

EATON VANCE FLOATING-RATE INCOME TRUST as of November 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Eaton Vance Floating-Rate Income Trust (the Trust) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The Trust, which was organized as a Massachusetts
business trust on April 28, 2004, seeks to provide a high level of current
income. The Trust will, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of
capital to the extent consistent with its primary goal of high current income.
The Trust pursues its objectives by investing primarily in senior, secured
floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies of the Trust. The policies are in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Certain senior loans are deemed to be liquid if
reliable market quotations are readily available for them. Liquid Senior Loans
are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing service. Other Senior
Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's investment adviser, Eaton Vance
Management (EVM), under procedures established by the Trustees as permitted by
Section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such procedures include
the consideration of relevant factors, data and information relating to fair
value, including (i) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data
relating to the Senior Loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate,
period until next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate of the
Senior Loan, the terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any related
agreements, and the position of the Senior Loan in the Borrower's debt
structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including the
Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral; (iii) the
creditworthiness of the Borrower, based on an evaluation of its financial
condition, financial statements and information about the Borrower's business,
cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv) information relating to
the market for the Senior Loan including price quotations for and trading in the
Senior Loan, and interests in similar Senior Loans and the market environment
and investor attitudes towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar Senior
Loans; (v) the experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the
agent and any intermediate participant in the Senior Loan; and (vi) general
economic and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan.
Other portfolio securities (other than short-term obligations, but including
listed issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more
pricing services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading
units of such securities which may use market information, transactions for
comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are
generally recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances,
portfolio securities will be valued at the last sale price on the exchange that
is the primary market for such securities, or the average of the last quoted bid
price and asked price for those securities for which the over-the-counter market
is the primary market or for listed securities in which there were no sales
during the day. Marketable securities listed in the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. The value of swaps will
be based on dealer quotations. Short-term obligations which mature in 60 days or
less, are valued at amortized cost, if their original term to maturity when
acquired by the Trust was 60 days or less or are valued at amortized cost using
their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if their original term to
maturity when acquired by the Trust was more than 60 days, unless in each case
this is determined not to represent fair value. OTC options are valued at the
mean between bid and asked price provided by dealers. Financial futures
contracts listed on commodity exchanges and exchange traded options are valued
at closing settlement prices. Securities for which there is no such quotation or
valuation are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or
at the direction of the Trustees. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus
accrued interest. Other portfolio securities for which there are no quotations
or valuations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or on
behalf of the Trustees.

B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual basis
at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is determined
on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of premium or
accretion of discount. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for
dividends received in cash and/or securities.

C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
or excise tax is necessary.

D INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after the
transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market fluctuations
during this period. To the extent that

                                       22
<Page>

when-issued or delayed delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs
the custodian to segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at
least equal to the amount of its purchase commitments.

E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Trust in connection with the offering
of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a reduction of
capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

F EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as custodian
of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a fee reduced by
credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance the Trust
maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the Trust's custodian
fees are reported as a reduction of expenses on the Statement of Operations.

G WRITTEN OPTIONS -- Upon the writing of a call or a put option, an amount equal
to the premium received by the Trust is included in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option written in
accordance with the Trust's policies on investment valuations discussed above.
Premiums received from writing options which expire are treated as realized
gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or are closed
are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount paid on the transaction to
determine the realized gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium
reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased by the Trust. The Trust, as
writer of an option, may have no control over whether the underlying securities
may be sold (call) or purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of
an unfavorable change in the price of the securities underlying the written
option.

H PURCHASED OPTIONS -- Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium
paid by the Trust is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an
investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market to
reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance with the
Trust's policies on investment valuations discussed above. If an option which
the Trust has purchased expires on the stipulated expiration date, the Trust
will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option. If the Trust enters
into a closing sale transaction, the Trust will realize a gain or loss,
depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale transaction are
greater or less than the cost of the option. If the Trust exercises a put
option, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying security,
and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium originally
paid. If the Trust exercises a call option, the cost of the security which the
Trust purchases upon exercise will be increased by the premium originally paid.

I FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon entering into a financial futures
contract, the Trust is required to deposit an amount (initial margin) either in
cash or securities equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price indicated
in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or received by
the Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the underlying securities, and are recorded for book purposes as
unrealized gains or losses by the Trust.

If the Trust enters into a closing transaction, the Trust will realize, for book
purposes, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
financial futures contract to sell and the financial futures contract to buy.
The Trust's investment in financial futures contracts is designed only to hedge
against anticipated future changes in interest rates. Should interest rates move
unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

J REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Trust may enter into reverse repurchase
agreements. Under such an agreement, the Trust temporarily transfers possession,
but not ownership, of a security to a counterparty, in return for cash. At the
same time, the Trust agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed-upon price
and time in the future. The Trust may enter into reverse repurchase agreements
for temporary purposes, such as to Trust withdrawals, or for use as hedging
instruments where the underlying security is denominated in a foreign currency.
As a form of leverage, reverse repurchase agreements may increase the risk of
fluctuation in the market value of the Trust's assets or in its yield.
Liabilities to counterparties under reverse repurchase agreements are recognized
in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities at the same time at which cash is
received by the Trust. The securities underlying such agreements continue to be
treated as owned by the Trust and remain in the Portfolio of Investments.
Interest charged on amounts borrowed by the Trust under reverse repurchase
agreements is accrued daily.

K TOTAL RETURN SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into swap agreements to hedge
against fluctuations in securities prices, interest rates or market conditions;
to change the duration of the overall portfolio; or to mitigate default risk.
Pursuant to these agreements, the Trust makes monthly payments at a rate equal
to a predetermined spread to the one-month LIBOR. In exchange, the Trust
receives payments based on the rate of return of a benchmark

                                       23
<Page>

industry index. During the term of the outstanding swap agreement, changes in
the underlying value of the swap are recorded as unrealized gains and losses.
Payments received or made at the end of the measurement period are recorded as
realized gains and losses. The value of the swap is determined by changes in the
relationship between the rate of interest and the benchmark industry index. The
Trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap
counterparty. However, the Trust does not anticipate non-performance by the
counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value of
interest rates or the index.

L CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts
for risk management purposes, including diversification. When the Trust is the
buyer of a credit default swap contract, the Trust is entitled to receive the
par (or other agreed-upon) value of a referenced debt obligation from the
counterparty to the contract in the event of a default by a third party, such as
a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer, on the debt obligation. In return, the Trust
would pay the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default occurs,
the Trust would have spent the stream of payments and received no benefit from
the contract. When the Trust is the seller of a credit default swap contract, it
receives the stream of payments, but is obligated to pay upon default of the
referenced debt obligation. As the seller, the Trust would effectively add
leverage to its portfolio because, in addition to its total net assets, the
Trust would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the
swap. The Trust will segregate assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents
in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swaps of
which it is the seller, marked to market on a daily basis. These transactions
involve certain risks, including the risk that the seller may be unable to
fulfill the transaction.

M USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

N INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers
and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to the Trust, and shareholders are
indemnified against personal liability for obligations of the Trust.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into agreements
with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The Trust's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.

O OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the securities
are purchased or sold.

P INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- The interim financial statements relating to
November 30, 2004 and for the period then ended have not been audited by an
independent registered public accounting firm, but in the opinion of the Trust's
management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2    AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust issued 3,480 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series A, 3,480
shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series B, 3,480 shares of Auction
Preferred Shares (APS) Series C, 3,480 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS)
Series D, and 3,480 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series E on
September 16, 2004 in a public offering. The underwriting discount and other
offering costs were recorded as a reduction of the capital of the common shares.
Dividends on the APS Series A, Series B, and Series C, which accrue daily, are
cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering of the APS and have
been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction. Dividends on the APS Series D
and Series E, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
at the offering of the APS and have been reset every 28 days thereafter by an
auction. Dividend rates ranged from 1.60% to 2.18% for Series A shares, 1.75% to
2.07% for Series B shares, 1.75% to 2.07% for Series C shares, 1.85% to 2.20%
for Series D shares, and 1.85% to 2.125% for Series E shares.

The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price equal
to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a redemption
price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if the
Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset maintenance requirements
with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in an
amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a class
have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the
holders of the APS and the

                                       24
<Page>

common shares have equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the
holders of the APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two
members of the Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of
$25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required
to maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trust pays an annual
fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for the
remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

3    DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income, after
payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares. In
addition, at least annually, the Trust intends to distribute net capital gain,
if any. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred Shares
is generally seven or twenty-eight days. The applicable dividend rate for the
Auction Preferred Shares on November 30, 2004 was 2.18%, 2.07%, 2.07%, 2.20%,
and 2.125%, for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, and Series E Shares,
respectively. For the period ended November 30, 2004, the Trust paid dividends
to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $344,416, $351,887, $354,828,
$358,861 and $354,628 for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, and Series E
Shares, respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such period
of 1.890%, 1.917%, 1.911%, 1.993%, and 1.955%, respectively.

The Trust distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
reporting basis. Accounting principals generally accepted in the United States
of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and
profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of capital.
Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to distributions
are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate primarily to the
method for amortizing premiums.

4    INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

EVM serves as the administrator of the Trust, but currently receives no
compensation for providing administrative services to the Trust. The investment
adviser fee is earned by Eaton Vance Management (EVM), as compensation for
management and investment advisory services rendered to the Trust. Under the
advisory agreement, EVM receives a monthly advisory fee in the amount equal to
0.75% annually of average daily gross assets of the Trust. For the period from
the start of business, June 29, 2004 to November 30, 2004, the advisory fee
amounted to $2,875,682.

In addition, the Adviser has contractually agreed to reimburse the Trust for
fees and other expenses in the amount of 0.20% of the average daily gross assets
of the Trust for the first five full years of the Trust's operations, 0.15% of
average daily gross assets in year six, 0.10% in year seven and 0.05% in year
eight. For the period from the start of business, June 29, 2004 to November 30,
2004 the Investment Adviser waived $766,848 of its advisory fee. In addition,
the Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Trust for all organizational costs,
estimated at $7,500.

During the period from the start of business, June 29, 2004 to November 30,
2004, the Trust engaged in purchase and sale transactions with other trusts that
also utilize EVM as an investment adviser. These purchase and sale transactions
complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and amounted
to $36,940,673 and $10,500,00, respectively.

Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above
organization.

5    PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term obligations and
including paydowns, aggregated $1,661,249,409 and $549,129,314 respectively, for
the period from the start of business, June 29, 2004, to November 30, 2004.

6    COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The Agreement and Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
unlimited number of full and fractional $0.01 par value common shares of
beneficial interest. Transactions in common shares were as follows:

7    FEDERAL INCOME TAX BASIS OF UNREALIZED APPRECIATION (DEPRECIATION)

The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of investments
owned by the Trust at November 30, 2004, as computed on a federal income tax
basis, were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                      <C>

</Table>

8    OVERDRAFT ADVANCES

Pursuant to the custodian agreement between the Trust and Investors Bank & Trust
(the Bank), the Bank may in its discretion advance funds to the Trust to make
properly authorized payments. When such payments result in an overdraft by the
Trust, the Trust is obligated to repay the Bank at the current rate of interest
charged by the Bank for secured loans (currently, a rate above the federal funds
rate). This obligation is payable on demand to the Bank. At November 30, 2004,
the Trust's payment due to the Bank pursuant to the foregoing arrangement was
$2,548,432.

9    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Trust may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the
normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure to
various market risks. These financial instruments include written options and
financial futures contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of
risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The
notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment
the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not
necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement
of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all
related and offsetting transactions are considered.

At November 30, 2004, the Trust had entered into a Credit Default Swap with
Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc. dated September 24, 2004 whereby the
Trust will receive 2.30% per year times the notional amount of $4,000,000. The
Trust makes payment only upon a default event on underlying loan assets (50 in
total, each representing 2.30% of the notional value of the swap). At November
30, 2004, the Trust had sufficient cash segregated to cover potential
obligations arising from open swap contracts.

EATON VANCE FLOATING-RATE INCOME TRUST
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have distributions reinvested in common shares (the
Shares) of the Trust. You may elect to participate in the Plan by completing the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan Application Form. If you do not participate, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC
Inc. as dividend paying agent. On the distribution payment date, if the net
asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The number of
Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per Share or
95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased on the
open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if any) are
taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC, Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

ITEM 8. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not required in this filing.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
