     To our Shareholders:

On March 31, 2005, the net asset value per share of your Fund was $15.41. During
the six month period ending March 31, 2005, total return at net asset value of
your Fund was 1.10%. During the most recent quarter ending March 31, 2005, the
total return at net asset value of your Fund was -4.50%. The total investment
return at market was -7.41% during the six month period ended March 31, 2005 and
was -7.23% during the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Comparisons to relevant
indices are listed below:

Investment Return at Market                    -7.23%         -7.41%
Investment Return at Net Asset Value           -4.50%         +1.10%
NASDAQ Biotech Index (NBI)                    -15.35%         -8.96%

</Table>

The Fund's Market Return exceeded the NBI during both the most recent quarter
and the six month period ended March 31, 2005. In addition, the NAV return
significantly exceeded that of the index during each of these periods.

The last six months has been quite volatile for the NBI. It advanced notably (up
7.6%) during the fourth calendar quarter of 2004 before declining even more
prominently (down 15.35%) during the first calendar quarter of 2005. While the
Fund's NAV and Market Price out-performed this index during the full six-month
period, both the Fund's NAV and market price trailed the index during the first
three months before out-pacing the Index during the second three-month period.
The Fund's underperformance during the first three months was in part due to
underweighting Amgen in the portfolio. Amgen's stock performed well and consists
of approximately 16% of the NBI. Out-performance during the second three months
was due in part to the fact that the Fund did not own Biogen Idec, the NBI's
greatest declining stock during the period. Separate from assessing our
performance relative to the NBI, we also note that both the NBI and the Fund's
NAV and Market Price trailed the broad S&P 500 Index.

During the six-month period ended March 31, 2005, the Fund established positions
in Abgenix, Connetics Corporation, Cytokinetics, DOV Pharmaceutical, Emageon,
Epix Pharmaceuticals, Lexicon Genetics, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Neurogen
Corporation, NPS Pharmaceuticals, Nuvelo, Penwest Pharmaceuticals, Protein
Design Labs, Renovis,

                                        1
<Page>

Rigel Pharmaceuticals, and Tercica. The Fund exited its positions in Amgen, Barr
Laboratories, Biofield, Celgene, Charles River Laboratories, Corixa, CTI
Molecular, CV Therapeutics, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Guilford Pharmaceuticals,
Lexicon Genetics, Neurocrine Biosciences, Pharmacyclics, Pozen, Rigel
Pharmaceuticals, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, and WebMD. During the quarter, the
Fund made no new investments in its venture portfolio.

In evaluating the Fund's portfolio, we are in aggregate pleased with the
individual company components. The Fund invests in a significant number of
small, emerging healthcare companies. The stock prices of such companies can be
volatile. It is not uncommon for the stock of a given company to be among the
Fund's best performers at one point and then be a trailing performer (or visa
versa) within a relatively short period of time. We attempt to mitigate the
effect of such volatility by appropriate buying and selling, but in general we
seek to invest a significant percentage of the Fund's assets in small/mid size
companies with excellent growth potential. This is probably most evident in the
Fund's venture portfolio. Over the last several years, the healthcare venture
market, including many of our venture investments, has not performed well.
However, we are seeing much improved performance in the venture portfolio of
late. In fact, during the six-month period described in this report, three
companies, Idun Pharmaceuticals, Theravance and Conor were the best performing
assets in the portfolio. Each of these companies were until recently in our
restricted stock portfolio. Idun was acquired by Pfizer very recently.
Theravance and Conor completed successful initial public offerings (IPO's) in
the fall of 2004. In fact since the early part of 2004, there have been seven
exits from the venture portfolio. In addition to those already mentioned,
Novacept was acquired and Senomyx, VNUS Medical and Acadia all completed IPOs.
Overall we think these companies have significant growth potential.

Beyond our portfolio, the past six months have been notable for the
biotechnology sector in particular and for the healthcare sector in general. In
the biotechnology sector, events surrounding Genentech, Biogen Idec and Elan
have been notable.

Genentech was one of the earliest biotechnology companies. It has produced a
number of impressive products through it lifetime. In 2004, its Avastin product
was approved to treat colorectal cancer after having demonstrated (unexpectedly
to some) to have impressive effects on this very difficult-to-treat disease.
Broad use of Avastin in this indication in colorectal cancer is now widely
anticipated; the drug is generally thought of as having blockbuster potential.
Most recently (in May of 2005), Genentech demonstrated that Avastin may well
also be useful to treat both non-small cell lung cancer as well as breast
cancer. We feel that the utility

                                        2
<Page>

of such a drug in three such common and insidious forms of cancer may turn out
to have been a catalyst for the sector. The Fund took a position in Genentech
during the first calendar quarter of 2005.

Conversely, the travails of Tysabri, a drug that has been marketed by Biogen
Idec and Elan to treat multiple sclerosis, may turn out to be a memorable
disappointment for the biotechnology sector. Tysabri was approved in 2004 after
demonstrating very impressive efficacy data in treating multiple sclerosis.
Initial launch of the drug was impressive to us, both in terms of reported sales
and in market share attained. Tysabri was expected to be a multi-billion dollar
product in a relatively short time. And while it was apparent that Tysabri was
an efficacious drug, during the first quarter of 2005, Elan and Biogen Idec
announced that two patients on Tysabri had developed a rare and often fatal
condition. This development lead to the removal of Tysabri from the marketplace
pending additional study. We think it will be difficult for this once heralded
drug to re-enter the market with anything like the previously anticipated sales
expectations. We feel that recent events surrounding Tysabri have had a sobering
effect on the biotech sector. And while the Fund has not had a recent position
in Biogen Idec, it did have a position in Elan from which it profitably exited
in 2004.

In general the biotech sector has been volatile in recent months with no clear
long-term upward or downward trend. We think that this uncertainty in direction
has been a response to a combination of both encouraging and discouraging
factors such as the events surrounding Avastin and Tysabri. We feel that in the
long run the positives will outweigh the negatives, but in the near future we
see a bit more uncertainty in the biotechnology sector.

There have also been events in the pharmaceutical sector that may have broad
impact on healthcare and potentially on the biotechnology sector. Events
surrounding a group of drugs in the so called COX-2 drugs in particular bear
note. Several large pharmaceutical companies including Merck and Pfizer have
marketed drugs in this class primarily to treat pain in arthritis patients.
These drugs had been thought to have gastrointestinal side effect advantages
over previously available drugs. Over the last few years, the COX-2 drugs have
exhibited excellent sales growth. Unfortunately, in the fall of 2004, Merck
elected to withdraw its COX-2 product from the market after it determined that
the drug might have unwanted cardiovascular side effects. This lead to a more
generalized evaluation of other drugs in the class. Ultimately, two other COX-2
drugs were either removed from the market or exhibited substantially reduced
use.

                                        3
<Page>

Certainly, events surrounding the COX-2 drugs have had negative effects on the
companies that marketed them. However, there may also be a broader impact. We
have some concern that the combined effects of the safety issues surrounding
Tysabri and the COX-2 drugs may produce, at least in the short term, a more
cautious approach by the FDA in reviewing new product applications. It is too
early to know for sure but we will continue to look for telltale signs.

As always, if you have any questions please call us at 617-772 8500. Thank you.

     Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting discounts and amortizing
     premiums on all debt securities. The effect of this change for the year
     ended September 30, 2002 was a decrease in net investment loss per share of
     $.006, an increase in net realized and unrealized loss on investments per
     share of $.006, and a decrease in the ratio of net investment loss to
     average net assets from (1.28%) to (1.25%). Per share data and ratios for

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 MARCH 31, 2005
                                   (UNAUDITED)

(1)  ORGANIZATION

          H&Q Life Sciences Investors (the Fund) is a Massachusetts business
     trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified
     closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective
     is long-term capital appreciation through investment in securities of
     companies in the healthcare industries. The Fund invests primarily in
     securities of public and private companies that are believed to have
     significant potential for above-average growth. The Fund was organized on
     February 20, 1992 and commenced operations on May 8, 1992.

          The Fund has adopted investment policies (non-fundamental investment
     policies) which may be changed by action of the Board of Trustees without
     shareholder approval. In June 2004, the Board of Trustees took action to
     make the following change (as indicated by the strikethrough) to one of the
     Fund's non fundamental investment policies: "Investments will not be made
     in any company with the objective of exercising control over that company's
     management, [BEGINSTRIKETHROUGH]and the Fund generally will not provide
     managerial assistance to any such company as is normally the case with
     venture capital funds.[ENDSTRIKETHROUGH] The Fund, however, may make
     investments as a co-investor with other venture capital groups that may
     provide issuers with significant managerial assistance."

          In June and September, 2004, the Board of Trustees amended the Fund's
     by-laws to provide for the office of Chief Compliance Officer and to
     require that all matters put to a vote of shareholders shall be decided by
     a vote of the majority of all votes validly cast at a meeting at which a
     quorum is present, unless otherwise specifically required by the Fund's
     Declaration of Trust or By-Laws.

          The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of
     certain estimates by management in determining the Fund's assets,
     liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these
     estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
     consistently followed by the Fund, which are in conformity with accounting
     principals generally accepted in the United States of America.

     INVESTMENT SECURITIES

          Investments traded on national securities exchanges or in the
     over-the-counter market that are National Market System securities are
     valued at the last sale price or, lacking any sales, at the mean between
     the last bid and asked prices. Other over-the-counter securities are valued
     at the most recent bid prices as obtained from one or more dealers that
     make markets in the securities. Exchange traded investments for which
     market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
     determined in good faith by the Trustees of the Fund. The value of venture
     capital and other restricted securities is determined in good faith by the
     Trustees. However, because of the uncertainty of venture capital and other
     restricted security valuations, these estimated values may differ
     significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market
     for these securities existed, and the differences could be material. See
     note 4 below. Temporary investments with maturity of 60 days or less are
     valued at amortized cost.

          Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Gains and
     losses from sales of investments are recorded using the "identified cost"
     method. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for
     amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividend income is
     recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and realized gains or losses on
     investments from affiliated issuers are identified in the Statement of
     Operations. Affiliated issuers are issuers in which the Fund holds 5% or
     more of the voting securities and are separately identified in the Schedule
     of Investments.

                                       16

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

          From time to time, in connection with managing cash and short-term
     investments the Fund may enter into transactions in repurchase agreements.
     When such transactions are entered into the Fund's custodian takes
     possession of the underlying collateral securities, the market value of
     which is at least equal to the principal, including accrued interest, of
     the repurchase transaction at all times. In the event of default or
     bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization and/or
     retention of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

     FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

          It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
     Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
     distribute to its shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and
     its net realized capital gains, if any. Therefore, no Federal income or
     excise tax provision is required.

     DISTRIBUTIONS

          The Fund records all distributions to shareholders from net investment
     income, if any, and realized gains on the ex-dividend date. Such
     distributions are determined in conformity with income tax regulations. Due
     to permanent book/tax differences in accounting for certain transactions,
     certain distributions may be treated as distributions from capital as
     opposed to distributions of net investment income or realized capital
     gains.

     DISTRIBUTION POLICY

          Distributions will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the
     Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Pursuant to an SEC
     exemptive order, the Fund has implemented a fixed distribution policy that
     permits the Fund to make quarterly distributions at a rate of 2% of the
     Fund's net assets to shareholders of record. The Fund intends to use net
     realized capital gains when making quarterly distributions. This could
     result in a return of capital to shareholders if the amount of the
     distribution exceeds the Fund's net investment income and realized capital
     gains. It is anticipated that net realized capital gains in excess of the
     total distributed under this policy would be included in the December
     distribution.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

          The cash amount shown in the Statement of Cash Flows is the amount
     included in the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities and represents
     cash on hand at its custodian and does not include temporary cash
     investments at March 31, 2005.

     INDEMNIFICATIONS

          Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and Trustees
     may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of
     the performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal
     course of business, the Fund enters into agreements with service providers
     that may contain indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under
     these agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be
     made against the fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on
     experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

(2)  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

          The aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment
     securities (other than temporary cash investments) for the six months ended
     March 31, 2005 totaled $48,033,476 and $69,032,497 respectively.

                                       17
<Page>

          At March 31, 2005, the total cost of securities for Federal income tax
     purposes was $178,448,049. The net unrealized gain on securities held by
     the Fund was $10,459,017, including gross unrealized gain of $42,876,216
     and gross unrealized loss of $32,417,199.

(3)  INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

          The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement (the
     "Advisory Agreement") with Hambrecht & Quist Capital Management LLC (the
     Adviser). Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays
     the Adviser a monthly fee at the rate when annualized of (i) 2.5% of the
     average net assets for the month of its venture capital and other
     restricted securities up to 25% of net assets and (ii) for the month, for
     all other assets, 1.0% of the average net assets up to $250 million, 0.9%
     of the average net assets for the next $250 million, 0.8% of the average
     net assets for the next $500 million and 0.7% of the average net assets
     thereafter. The aggregate fee may not exceed a rate when annualized of
     1.375%.

          The Fund has entered into a Services Agreement (the "Agreement") with
     the Adviser. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses
     the Adviser for certain services related to a portion of the payment of
     salary and provision of benefits to the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer.
     During the six months ended March 31, 2005 these payments amounted to
     $37,370 and are included in "Other" under the heading "EXPENSES" in the
     Statement of Operations. These expenses along with insurance expenses of
     $28,230 incurred to unaffiliated entities are the major components of
     "Other" under the heading "EXPENSES" in the Statement of Operations.
     Expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement as well as certain expenses
     paid for by the Adviser are allocated in an equitable fashion to the Fund.

          Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are also officers of the
     Adviser. Trustees who are not affiliates of the Adviser receive an annual
     fee of $20,000 plus $500 for each Committee on which they serve and $1,000
     for each meeting attended.

(4)  VENTURE CAPITAL AND OTHER RESTRICTED SECURITIES

          The Fund may invest in venture capital and other restricted securities
     if these securities would currently comprise 40% or less of net assets. The
     value of these securities represents 27.73% of the Fund's net assets at
     March 31, 2005.

          The Fund maintains an investment restriction that prohibits the Fund
     from purchasing more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any
     issuer. In order to clarify that restriction, the Board of Trustees
     (effective September 30, 2004), has determined that for purposes of that
     restriction, the Fund will consider outstanding voting securities of an
     issuer to include any security of the issuer that entitles the owner or
     holder to vote for the election of directors of the issuer (a "voting
     security") and any other outstanding security of the issuer that is
     exercisable for or convertible into a voting security within 60 days from
     the date of calculation.

          During the year ended September 30, 2004, a restricted security was
     exchanged for cash in connection with a corporate action, a portion of
     which has been retained by the issuer in an escrow account pending
     resolution of certain contingencies and whose estimated value of $247,144
     at March 31, 2005 has been determined by the Trustees. The value of the
     escrow account is included in the Receivable for Investments Sold in the
     Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
