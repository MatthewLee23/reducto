CHAIRMAN'S LETTER
- -----------------

[PHOTO OF PETER SUNDMAN]

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

Getting off on the right foot is always important. It is a pleasure to report,
therefore, that the Neuberger Berman Municipal Closed-End Funds are off to a
strong start in their first full reporting period. Our Funds have all generated
positive returns on a net asset value basis, and outperformed their benchmark
indices for the six months ending April 30, 2003.

In my last letter, I assured you that we would strive for the highest
tax-protected yield consistent with controlling risk. Since then, we have been
working hard to achieve that goal. Our investment vehicle of choice is the
intermediate-term municipal bond (with maturity between three and eight years).
Our experience and research lead us to believe that this maturity range offers
the best risk/reward profile on the yield curve, providing much of the return of
longer-term bonds, with less volatility and risk.

Today's markets offer unique challenges to investment managers in the municipal
bond arena. As with fixed income in general, municipal bonds have achieved
meaningful gains in recent years, in stark contrast to stocks. At the same time,
many states and municipalities are facing major financial issues, as they deal
with weakened tax revenues and increasing budget deficits. While our managers

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)

expect municipal markets to remain robust, we are keenly aware of the need for
close attention to credit quality, sector selection and risk management.

As always, we believe our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax-protected income and
principal preservation, in both the near and long term.

Thank you again for your trust in Neuberger Berman.

Sincerely,

                                /s/ Peter Sundman
                                  PETER SUNDMAN

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS PORTFOLIO COMMENTARIES
- --------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to report that the Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., the
California Intermediate Municipal Fund, Inc. and the New York Intermediate
Municipal Fund, Inc., on a net asset value (NAV) basis, delivered positive
returns for the first half of fiscal 2003. During this reporting period the
municipal bond market continued to post strong returns and the Funds
participated in this strength. Our diligent focus on stable municipal securities
helped the Funds provide good returns and preserve capital--two goals not easily
achieved in the current economic and financial market environment.

With investor attention focused almost exclusively on geopolitical issues,
equities faltered, while the relative safety of fixed-income investments became
increasingly attractive. Although bad news for the equity markets often means
good news for bonds, the municipal bond market was not entirely immune to
broader market events. Our diligent focus on credit quality helped us limit our
exposure to weak credits in the airline and tobacco industries, two areas that
have been hurt particularly hard by the current economic environment and
company-specific issues. Knowing that all bonds are not created equal, our
challenge is to be in the right sectors at the right time. Careful security
selection during the period benefited the Funds' overall returns.

Weakness at the federal budget level has trickled down to the state and local
level, where governments are now facing declining tax revenues and budget
deficits for the foreseeable future. We have therefore intensified our
ever-vigilant focus on credit quality. In addition to facing large budget
shortfalls, New York municipal bonds have been hurt by general financial market
weakness and a slowdown in tourism following the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks. California municipal bonds have also suffered from increasingly large
budget deficits, along with the dramatic downturn in the high-tech sector, which
in the past was a powerful economic driver, and a lack of growth in trade with
Japan and the Far East. Given the budget problems in New York and California, we
continue to seek opportunities to invest in these areas at attractive price
levels, but intend to only buy the bonds of issuers that meet our strict credit
quality standards. If we discover that we have made an investment mistake, we
will be dispassionate sellers.

With interest rates still hovering at near 40-year lows, we were able to lock in
a significant portion of our leverage costs for a one-year period. In seeking to
provide a competitive level of income in this environment, we have increased our
exposure to higher-yielding bonds in the BBB and A rating categories that meet
our strict quality criteria.

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)

Fixed-income investments have been in a dramatic bull market since early 2000,
and have continued to produce strong results through the end of this reporting
period. With interest rates at extraordinarily low levels, it is incumbent upon
us to provide our shareholders with a competitive level of tax-protected income,
while emphasizing safety and principal preservation. We believe that our
conservative approach in seeking these objectives will benefit our shareholders
in the near and long term.

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL FUND INC.

For its first full six months of operation, the Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
outperformed the Lehman Brothers 10-Year Municipal Bond Index and generated

37.23% of assets. With the Fund now fully invested, its duration is in the
7-year range, where it is expected to remain.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered. There is a
one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in
the open market through a stock exchange.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+   Investment securities of the Fund are valued daily by obtaining bid price
    quotations from independent pricing services on all securities available in
    each service's data base. For all other securities requiring daily
    quotations, bid prices are obtained from principal market makers in those
    securities or, if quotations are not available, by a method the directors of
    Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. ("California"),
    Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. ("Intermediate"), and
    Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York")
    (individually a "Fund", collectively, the "Funds"), believe accurately
    reflects fair value. Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until
    maturity may be valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned,
    approximates market value.

##  At April 30, 2003, selected Fund information on a U.S. Federal income tax
    basis was as follows:

@   Municipal securities held by the Funds are within the four highest rating
    categories (with respect to at least 80% of total assets) assigned by a
    nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") such as
    Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Investors
    Services, Inc. or, where not rated, are determined by the Funds' investment
    manager to be of comparable quality. Approximately 64%, 57%, and 35% of the
    municipal securities held by California, Intermediate, and New York,
    respectively, have credit enhancement features backing them, which the Funds
    may rely on, such as letters of credit, insurance, or guarantees. Without
    these credit enhancement features the securities may or may not meet the
    quality standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported by
    securities in escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its
    agencies, or instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay the
    periodic interest due and the principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give
    the Funds the right to sell back the issue on the date specified.

++  Security is guaranteed by the corporate obligor.

*   Security purchased on a when-issued basis. At April 30, 2003, these
    securities amounted to $1,121,000 for Intermediate.

**  Security is segregated as collateral for when-issued purchase commitments.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1      GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
       ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
       ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal
       Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", collectively, the "Funds")
       were organized as Maryland corporations on July 29, 2002. California and
       New York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end management
       investment companies and Intermediate is registered as a diversified,
       closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act
       of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Each Fund had no operations until
       September 27, 2002, other than matters relating to their organization and
       the sale on September 19, 2002 of 6,981 shares of common stock for
       $100,005 ($14.325 per share) from each Fund to Neuberger Berman, LLC
       ("Neuberger"), the Funds' sub-adviser. The Board of Directors of the
       Funds may classify or re-classify any unissued shares of capital stock,
       into one or more classes of preferred stock, without the approval of
       shareholders.

       The assets of each Fund belong only to that Fund, and the liabilities of
       each Fund are borne solely by that Fund and no other.

       The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
       principles generally accepted in the United States requires Neuberger
       Berman Management Inc. ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions
       at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
       those estimates.

2      PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
       notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

3      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions
       are recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income, including accretion
       of discount (adjusted for original issue discount, where applicable) and
       amortization of premium, where applicable, is recorded on the accrual
       basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are
       recorded on the basis of identified cost.

4      FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: The Funds are treated as separate entities for U.S.
       Federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to continue to
       qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
       provisions available to certain investment companies, as defined in
       applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code, and to make
       distributions of investment company taxable income and net capital gains
       (after reduction for any amounts available for U.S. Federal income tax
       purposes as capital loss carryforwards) sufficient to relieve them from
       all, or substantially all, U.S. Federal income taxes. Accordingly, each
       Fund paid no U.S. Federal income taxes and no provision for U.S. Federal
       income taxes was required.

5      DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net
       of expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to
       declare and pay dividends to common shareholders from net investment
       income on a monthly basis. Distributions from net realized capital gains,
       if any, are normally distributed in December. Income dividends and
       capital gain distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the
       ex-dividend date. To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains,
       if any, can be offset

                                       26

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)

       by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not to
       distribute such gains. Dividends and distributions to preferred
       shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-6.

       Each Fund distinguishes between dividends on a tax basis and a financial
       reporting basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings
       and profits are reported in the financial statements as a tax return of
       capital. Differences in the recognition or classification of income
       between the financial statements and tax earnings and profits which
       result in temporary over-distributions for financial statement purposes
       are classified as distributions in excess of net investment income or
       accumulated net realized gains in the components of net assets on the
       Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

       Subsequent to April 30, 2003, the Board of each Fund declared dividends
       to common shareholders from their net investment income payable June 16,
       2003, to shareholders of record on May 27, 2003, with an ex-dividend date
       of May 22, 2003, as follows:

6      REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds re-classified
       unissued shares of capital stock into several series of Auction Market
       Preferred Shares ("AMPS"), as follows:

       On December 13, 2002, the Funds issued several series of AMPS, as
       follows:

</Table>

       All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of
       $25,000 per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends, whether or not
       earned or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon
       ("Liquidation Value"). Dividends to AMPS shareholders, which are
       cumulative, are accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay
       dividends every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28 days
       for each Fund's AMPS Series B.

       Dividend rates are reset every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A,
       based on the results of an auction. For the period from December 13, 2002
       to April 30, 2003, dividend rates ranged as follows:

       Upon issuance, dividend rates were reset every 28 days for each Fund's
       AMPS Series B, based on the results of an auction. Each Fund's AMPS

       The Funds declared dividends to AMPS shareholders for the period May 1,

</Table>

       The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part,
       on the second business day preceding any dividend payment date at
       Liquidation Value.

       The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
       Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
       declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
       shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at
       Liquidation Value.

       The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless
       otherwise required by law, will vote with holders of common stock as a
       single class, except that the AMPS will vote separately as a class on
       certain matters, as required by law. The holders of AMPS, voting as a
       separate class, are entitled at all times to elect two Directors of each
       Fund, and to elect a majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund
       failed to pay dividends on preferred shares for two consecutive years.

7      ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay
       all organizational expenses and the amount by which each Fund's offering
       costs for common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03 per share.
       Offering costs for common stock paid by each Fund were charged as a
       reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the completion of each
       Fund's offering and amounted to $203,759, $620,459, and $167,159 for
       California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

       Additionally, estimated offering costs of $245,000, $345,000, and
       $245,000 and sales loads of $590,000, $1,794,000, and $482,500 for AMPS
       paid by California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, were
       charged as a reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the completion
       of each Fund's AMPS offering.

8      CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
       held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
       developments, including those particular to a specific industry or
       region. The investment policies of California and New York involve
       investing substantially all of their assets in California state and New
       York state municipal bonds, respectively. This policy makes those funds

                                       28
<Page>

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)

       more susceptible to adverse economic, political, regulatory or other
       factors affecting the issuers of such municipal bonds than a fund that
       does not limit its investments to such issuers.

       NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
       AFFILIATES:

       Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
       Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
       Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed
       Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund less
       liabilities, other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for
       purposes of leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the
       Liquidation Value of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

       Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
       fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the following annual
       rates:

<Table>

                   2011                                    0.05
</Table>

       Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
       31, 2011.

       For the six months ended April 30, 2003, such waived fees amounted to
       $176,588, $538,442, and $144,304 for California, Intermediate, and New
       York, respectively.

       Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
       Agreement ("Agreement"). Pursuant to this Agreement each Fund pays
       Management an administration fee at the annual rate of 0.30% of its
       average daily Managed Assets.

       Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
       ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
       Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
       under the agreement.

       Management and Neuberger, a member firm of The New York Stock Exchange
       and sub-adviser to each Fund, are wholly owned subsidiaries of Neuberger
       Berman Inc., a publicly held company. Neuberger is retained by Management
       to furnish it with investment recommendations and research information
       without added cost to each Fund. Several individuals who are officers
       and/or Directors of each Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or
       Management.

       Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
       custodian contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected in the
       Statements of Operations under the caption Custodian fees, was a
       reduction of $737, $620, and $697 for California, Intermediate, and New
       York, respectively.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under each Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. For each Fund, total
     return would have been lower if Management had not waived the investment

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
- --------------------------

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
pursuant to which all holders of common stock ("Common Stockholders") whose
shares are registered in their own names will have all dividends and any capital
gain distributions (referred to collectively in this section as "dividends") on
their shares automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock
("Common Shares") by The Bank of New York, as agent for the Common Stockholders
("Plan Agent"), unless such Common Stockholders elect to receive cash. An
election to receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at a Common Stockholder's
option. In the case of record Common Stockholders such as banks, brokers or
other nominees that hold shares of common stock for others who are the
beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the
number of shares certified from time to time by the record Common Stockholder as
representing the total amount registered in such Common Stockholder's name and
held for the account of beneficial owners who participate in the Plan. Common
Stockholders whose shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other
nominee should contact the nominee for details. Such stockholders may not be
able to transfer their shares to another nominee and continue to participate in
the Plan. All dividends to investors who elect not to participate in the Plan
(or whose bank, broker or other nominee elects not to participate on the
investor's behalf), will be paid in cash by check mailed, in the case of direct
Common Stockholders, to the record holder by The Bank of New York, as the Fund's
dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your bank, broker or other nominee) elect not to participate in
the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will receive as a result of a Fund
dividend will be determined as follows:

     (1)  If Common Shares are trading at or above their net asset value (minus
          estimated brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the
          purchase of Common Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the
          Fund will issue new Common Shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
          value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market
          price per Common Share on the payment date. Because Common Shares may
          be issued at less than their market price, Plan participants may get a
          benefit that non-participants do not.

     (2)  If Common Shares are trading below their net asset value (minus
          estimated brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the
          purchase of Common Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the
          Plan Agent will receive the dividend in cash and will purchase Common
          Shares in the open market, on the American Stock Exchange or
          elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
          market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent
          has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per
          Common Share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
          thereof on the payment date, resulting in the purchase of fewer Common
          Shares than if the dividend had been paid in Common Shares issued by
          the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends received in cash to
          purchase Common Shares in the open market on or shortly after the
          payment date, but in no event later than the ex-dividend date for the
          next dividend. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
          payments.

If you own Common Shares directly, you may withdraw from the Plan at any time by
giving written notice to the Plan Agent; please be sure to include your name and
account number. You may also rejoin the Plan later. Contact the Plan Agent at
the following address for information on how to do so: The Bank of New York,
ATTN: Stock Transfer Administration, 101 Barclay Street, 11-E, New York, New
York 10286. If you wish, the Plan Agent will sell the Common Shares and send you
the proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all stockholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
stockholders may need for tax records. The Plan Agent will also furnish each
Common Stockholder with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive dividends in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares held
for you under the Plan.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN CONT'D
- ---------------------------------

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends in Common
Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market purchases.

Automatically reinvested dividends are taxed in the same manner as cash
dividends.

The Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund
reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the
participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from your
broker or by calling The Bank of New York at 1-800-524-4458.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that from time to time the Fund may purchase shares of its
common stock in the open market at market prices.
