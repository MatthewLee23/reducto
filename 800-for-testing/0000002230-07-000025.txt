reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions, or the sale of any shares. These results should not be
considered representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which
may be realized in the future.

                            LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Year in Review
We are pleased to report a strong 15.0% total return on net assets for the Fund
in 2006. This compares well with the S&P 500 Index's return of 15.8%, and is
well ahead of the Lipper Large Cap Core Mutual Fund Average return of 13.5%. We
entered 2006 expecting a year of modest returns based on decelerating earnings
growth, but these were surpassed in the latter part of the year. Profit margins
were maintained or increased by many corporations due to strong cost-cutting
measures and earnings per share were further boosted by large share-repurchase
programs. When all the numbers are in, operating earnings per share growth of
the companies in the S&P 500 will most likely have been over 10% for an
unprecedented fourth year in a row, contributing to the higher return.

                           [PHOTO OF DOUGLAS G. OBER]]
                               Douglas G. Ober,
                              Chairman and Chief
                               Executive Officer

The short-term interest rate increases begun by the Federal Reserve Board (the
Fed) in 2004 were continued through the first six months of 2006. These actions
cast a pall over equity markets, resulting in a low 2.7% return for the S&P 500
through June 30. The yield curve (the variation of interest rates with time) had
become inverted, with short-term rates running higher than long-term rates, in
2005 and remained so through 2006. Such an inversion has historically preceded
slower economic growth or an outright recession. When the Fed took no action to
raise short-term rates further in the latter half of the year, investors became
more optimistic, analysts ceased lowering corporate earnings estimates, and the
equity markets headed up.

In addition to the above, there was a general increase in private equity
transactions, in which hedge funds and private investors took large positions
in public companies or bought them outright. Examples from our portfolio
included Clear Channel Communications and HCA, Inc. Such transactions
frequently were done at higher valuations than had been priced into the equity
markets, resulting in upward revaluations of many public companies and
consequent surges in the markets that were more speculative in nature than
fundamentally-based. There was also a pick-up in industry consolidation in a
number of sectors, including materials, industrial, financial,
telecommunications, and technology, as companies utilized large cash hoards
and/or stock to expand their businesses through acquisition. Several companies
in our portfolio were involved in such transactions, including AT&T, North Fork
Bancorp, Lucent Technologies, and Caremark Rx.

While this kind of activity has a salutary effect on market valuations, it has
no near-term impact on overall economic growth. Indeed, after strong growth in
the first quarter, the economy grew at roughly 2% for the next two quarters and
probably at a similar rate in the final three months of the year. Europe, on
the other hand, experienced accelerating, though still modest, growth and most
of the rest of the world grew strongly, though at a slightly reduced rate. We
chose not to participate directly in the international growth, preferring to
hold positions in domestic companies with major overseas operations, though we
did add Teva Pharmaceuticals, an Israeli corporation, to the portfolio.

Our performance in 2006 was led by our holdings in the telecom services,
energy, and consumer sectors of the economy. Our technology holdings
outperformed the S&P Index sector by nearly 6 percentage points, with a 14.3%
return. The Fund's investments in the health care sector also outperformed the
Index sector, by a more modest amount. Underperforming sectors included
financials, materials, industrials, and utilities, though both financials and
industrials had double-digit returns. Within the financials, we have generally
avoided real estate companies and brokers (with Morgan Stanley the exception),
which performed best in the group. The materials sector benefited from a flurry
of acquisitions in the metals group, where we have no current exposure. The
return of our industrial sector holdings was negatively impacted by our large
GE holding, which finally began to improve toward the end of the year.
Utilities with merchant generating assets and those with nuclear power plants,
which we have generally avoided, were the outstanding performers within the
utilities sector. Overall, there was only a modest difference between the
Fund's performance and that of the S&P 500 and it can in some part be accounted
for by the merger and acquisition activity mentioned above. Our philosophy of
investing in companies with strong outlooks often means we do not benefit from
such activity in the short term as we are less likely to own shares of merger
or acquisition targets. We believe that our approach results in more consistent
returns over the long term.

Investment Results
At the end of 2006 our net assets were $1,377,418,310 or $15.86 per share on
86,838,223 shares outstanding. This compares with $1,266,728,652 or $14.71 per
share on 86,099,607 shares outstanding a year earlier.

                                                                             3
<PAGE>

Net investment income for 2006 was $19,691,488 compared to $18,288,551 for
2005. These earnings are equal to $0.23 and $0.22 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. Our 0.50%
expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) in 2006 was once again very low
compared to the fund industry in general.

Net realized gains amounted to $56,553,881 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $316,477,367 at December
31, 2005 to $418,756,256 at year end.

Dividends and Distributions
The total dividends and distributions paid in 2006 were $0.90 per share
compared to $0.86 in 2005. The table on page 21 shows the history of our
dividends and distributions over the past fifteen years, including the annual
rate of distribution as a percentage of the average daily market price of the
Company's Common Stock. In 2006, the annual rate of distribution was 6.80%
compared to 6.65% in 2005. As announced on November 9, 2006, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.10 and capital gains of
$0.65 was made on December 27, 2006, both realized and taxable in 2006. On
January 11, 2007, an additional distribution of $0.05 per share was declared to
shareholders of record February 16, 2007, payable March 1, 2007, representing
the balance of undistributed net investment income and capital gains earned
during 2006 and an initial distribution from 2007 net investment income, all
taxable to shareholders in 2007.

Outlook for 2007
For the past two years, we have anticipated a slowdown in the domestic economy,
to a significant degree due to higher energy prices and short-term interest
rates. Surprisingly, both the consumer and the industrial sectors of the
economy seem to have adapted to these expected drags on growth, although some
impact has been felt. Particular industries, notably housing and autos, have
been hit harder than others and will take some time to recover. In general,
though, conditions are good and there is little reason to expect the economy to
fall into recession. After a brief pause, manufacturing industries are growing;
consumers continue to spend the bulk of their paychecks; the Fed has stopped
raising interest rates for now; energy prices have begun to ease with a mild
early part of the winter; and the dollar has only weakened modestly. There is
general agreement among economists that a "soft landing" will occur, in which
the economy slows sufficiently that inflation is brought below 2% but does not
reach recession. Equity investors are content with this outlook, though they
have had to temper expectations that the Fed will cut rates in the first half
of the year.

It is our belief that inflation is more stubborn than many believe and that Fed
Chairman Bernanke will keep short-term interest rates at the current level for
most, if not all, of 2007, and may even raise them further if the economy
rebounds. Housing and energy prices have declined from their highest levels, as
have the prices of some industrial raw materials, but the impact of these price
increases over the past several years still are not reflected in consumer
prices. Agricultural commodities, especially corn, remain very expensive, with
little sign of easing, yet food price increases have not been remarkable. We
would expect Mr. Bernanke, as the new Fed chairman, to take action to firmly
establish his credentials as an inflation fighter. Thus, he is more likely to
err on the side of caution than take a chance that inflation will subside on
its own.

With the expectation that interest rates will remain high longer, we are not
looking for the economy to accelerate until the final quarter of 2007 and
perhaps not until 2008. Year-over-year, real GDP growth should amount to 2% to
2 1/2% in 2007 at best. The cost-cutting which occurred in 2006 cannot continue
indefinitely, nor can share-buybacks boost earnings by more than 2% or so. This
leaves anticipated growth in the earnings per share of the S&P 500 of 5% to 7%.
Such a modest level of earnings growth would normally generate rather subdued
returns in the equity markets. We do, however, believe that multiple expansion
could occur in 2007, with the market's price/earnings ratio rising to 17 from
16 on a trailing basis, and drive returns closer to the 10% level. The merger,
acquisition, and privatization activity which began in earnest in 2006 is
expected to continue this year and may even accelerate. As noted previously,
this has been reflected to some degree in equity markets already and should
continue to drive valuations upward until stocks become over-valued, which they
are not currently, or the current liquidity of the markets declines. We do not
expect that the new Congress, controlled by Democrats, will have much impact on
the economy in the short term. Energy legislation, the elimination of tax cuts,
increased social program spending, and the ongoing war in Iraq will, however,
serve as a drag on the economy over time.

Outside the U. S., the developing economies of Asia are expected to slow their
rapid rate of growth somewhat. The more developed countries of Europe, the
Americas, and Asia should also experience slower growth as central banks have
raised interest rates and the impacts of high energy and commodity prices are
being felt. Given the relative sizes of the various economies, we expect that
worldwide growth will be in the range of 3% to 3 1/2%. Further weakening of the
U. S. dollar is likely to stimulate exports and reduce imports domestically,

thus lowering our trade deficit. This will also provide a test of how tightly
the economies of other countries are linked to ours. Should the lower demand
for foreign goods in this country trigger a more dramatic slowing outside the
U. S., there could be a worldwide recession, in which event our holdings in
multi-national companies would not perform well. We do not expect a downward
spiral into recession, however, as most economies are in much better financial
condition than in the past. Any change in the situation in the Middle East,
either more antagonistic or calming, will be felt worldwide in the form of
significantly higher or lower energy prices. Any change in the portfolio to
reflect one or the other of these possibilities would be risky; we prefer to
take the position that energy prices will continue to exhibit high volatility
in 2007.

With the bulk of our holdings in the largest-capitalization segment of the
market, there is not likely to be much acquisition or privatization activity in
the portfolio. We should, however, benefit significantly from any multiple
expansion which occurs as well as from industry consolidation, which our
companies might well lead through merger. While our outlook for the rest of the
world is cautious, international growth still looks stronger than domestic
growth. Many of our investments are in multi-national companies, which should
perform particularly well in this anticipated environment. We believe that
these multi-national companies, as well as the ones we hold that are focused on
domestic activity, have excellent long-term prospects and, absent unforeseen
events, we do not anticipate making wholesale changes in the portfolio in 2007.

Special Shareholder Meeting
We were gratified with the strong support shown by our shareholders at the
special meeting held on November 7, 2006. All eight of the proposals of the
Board of Directors were overwhelmingly approved, with no proposal receiving
less than 83% of the votes cast. A full report of the meeting can be found on
page 23. The approval of these important changes to the corporate charter
provides the Company with additional tools to protect the interests of our
long-term shareholders. You have clearly expressed your interest in seeing the
Company continue as a closed-end fund, and your action has strengthened our
ability to do so.

Share Repurchase Program
On December 14, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company over
the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same restriction as
in the past, namely that shares can be repurchased when the discount of the
market price of the shares from the net asset value is 10% or greater.

From the beginning of 2007 through January 25, 2007, a total of 158,900 shares
have been repurchased at a total cost of $2,197,875 and a weighted average
discount from net asset value of 13.1%.

Effective January 1, 2007, Mr. David D. Weaver was promoted to Vice
President--Research. Mr. Weaver has been a senior research analyst covering
consumer discretionary and industrials sectors for the Company.

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Baltimore on March 27, 2007, is expected to be mailed on or about February 16,
2007.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company is an
internally-managed fund whose investment objectives are preservation of
capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments, and an
opportunity for capital appreciation.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of

5. Retirement Plans

The Company initially applied the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") Statement No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, at December 31, 2006. This accounting
standard requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit plan in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities, and recognition of changes in the funded status in the years in
which the changes occur through the capital accounts. The transition rules for
implementing the standard require applying the provisions as of the end of the
year of initial implementation with no retrospective application. The
incremental effects on the line items in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities at December 31, 2006, are as follows:

Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs are:

              Rate of compensation increase            7.00% 7.00%
</TABLE>

The assumption for the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on the
actual long-term historical returns realized by the plan assets, weighted
according to the current asset mix.

The asset allocations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, by asset category, are as
follows:

</TABLE>

Equity securities include Common Stock of the Company in the amount of $718,924
(6% of total plan assets) and $616,864 (6% of total plan assets) at December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The primary objective of the Company's pension plan is to provide capital
appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital through a portfolio
of stocks and fixed income securities. The equity portion of the portfolio may
range from 50% to 75% of total portfolio assets. The fixed income portion of
the portfolio may range from 25% to 50% of total portfolio assets and cash may
range from 0% to 25% of total portfolio assets. Subject to these allocation
ranges, the portfolio may be invested in any of the following securities:
common stocks, preferred
stocks, American Depository Receipts, foreign securities, mutual funds,
convertible securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, U.S. government
securities, and U.S. government agency securities.

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Company anticipates making no
contribution to the plans in 2007.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. The Company expensed contributions to this plan of $182,985 and
$181,236 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
respectively. The Company does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. Equity-Based Compensation

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, although unexercised awards
granted in 2004 and prior years remain outstanding. The 1985 Plan permitted the
issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up
to 2,610,146 shares of the Company's Common Stock at the fair market value on
the date of grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by
the Company during subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not less
than one year after the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant. The
stock appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to
exercise their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the
difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the
Common Stock at the date of surrender. All options terminate 10 years from the
date of grant if not exercised.

                                                                             11

</TABLE>

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the year ended December 31, 2006 was $293,582.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's
Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based restricted
stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of a specified
three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned contingent on
achieving certain performance targets. If performance targets are not achieved,
all or a portion of the performance-based restricted shares are forfeited and
become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based restricted stock
awards vest ratably over a three year period and nonperformance-based
restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors) vest over a one year
period. It is the current intention that employee grants will be
performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in the event
of death or retirement. Non- employee directors also may elect to defer a
portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be paid by
delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at fair market
value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which remains
available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2006 is
3,329,260 shares.

The Company pays dividends and dividend equivalents on outstanding awards,
which are charged to net assets when paid. Dividends and dividend equivalents
paid on restricted awards that are later forfeited are reclassified to
compensation expense.

A summary of the status of the Company's awards granted under the 2005 Plan as
of December 31, 2006, and changes during the period then ended, is presented
below:

          ============================================================
</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $271,629.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $119,737. As of December
31, 2006, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $527,227, a
component of additional capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based
compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.82 years. The total fair
value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
$168,230 and $9,889, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



7. Expenses

The aggregate remuneration paid during the year ended December 31, 2006 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,592,307, of which $339,415 was paid to
directors who were not officers. These amounts represent the taxable income to
the Company's officers and directors and therefore differ from the amounts
reported in the accompanying Statement of Operations that are recorded and
expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. At December 31, 2006, the Company had securities on loan of
$67,475,119, and held collateral of $69,086,380, consisting of an investment
trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

9. New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how
uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed
in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns
to determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in
the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is required to be implemented no later
than the Company's June 29, 2007 net asset value. The application of FIN 48 is
not expected to materially impact the Company's financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("FAS 157"), which provides enhanced guidance
for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard requires
companies to provide expanded information about the assets and liabilities
measured at fair value and the potential effect of these fair valuations on an
entity's financial performance. The standard does not expand the use of fair
value in any circumstances, but provides clarification on acceptable fair
valuation methods and applications. Adoption of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. Application of the standard is not
expected to materially impact the Company's financial statements.

                                                                             13

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at December 31, 2006, the results of
its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2006 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan (see page 25).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.adamsexpress.com. The daily NAV is also
available on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XADEX.
The week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers.

Adams Express daily trading is shown in the stock tables of many daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "AdaEx." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Company at (800)
638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Adams Express stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept
in a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 25.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Adams
Express?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc. as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Adams Express is simple and is handled through our transfer
agent. The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of
transfer. They will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the
transfer agent stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer
agent will send you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your
transfer.

How do I transfer shares held at American Stock Transfer (AST)?

There are many circumstances that require the transfer of shares to new
registrations, e.g., marriage, death, a child reaching the age of maturity, or
giving shares as a gift. Each situation requires different forms of
documentation to support the transfer. You may obtain transfer instructions and
download the necessary forms from our transfer agent's website:
www.amstock.com. Click on Shareholder Services, then General Shareholder
Information and Transfer Instructions.

balance of the net investment income for the year and the net realized capital
gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to receive the year-end
distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this distribution, all
stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement notice and an election

Item 2. Code of Ethics.

On  June 12, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a code  of
ethics  that  applies  to registrant's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer. The code of  ethics
is     available     on     registrant's     website     at:
www.adamsexpress.com. Since the code of ethics  was  adopted
there  have  been no amendments to it nor have  any  waivers
from any of its provisions been granted.

Item 3. Audit  Committee  Financial  Expert.

The  board of directors has determined that at least one  of
the  members  of  registrant's  audit  committee  meets  the
definition of audit committee financial expert as that  term
is  defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The
director on the registrant's audit committee whom the  board
of   directors  has  determined  meets  such  definition  is
Kathleen  T.  McGahran,  who  is  independent  pursuant   to
paragraph (a)(2) of this Item.

Item 4.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

     (a)   Audit  Fees.  The aggregate fees for professional
services    rendered    by    its   independent    auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for the audits of  the  Companys
annual  and  semi-annual financial statements for  2006  and
2005 were $77,405 and $64,750 respectively.

     (b)   Audit  Related Fees. There were no  audit-related
fees in 2006 and 2005.

     (c)   Tax  Fees.  The aggregate fees to registrant  for
professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
for  the review of registrant's excise tax calculations  and
preparations  of federal, state and excise tax  returns  for
2006 and 2005 were $11,278 and $10,540, respectively.

     (d)   All Other Fees.  The aggregate fees to registrant
by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP other than for  the  services
referenced  above for 2006 and 2005 were $10,044  and  $800,
respectively.  The $10,044 for services in 2006  related  to
the  review of the Company's procedures for calculating  the
amounts  to be paid or granted to the Company's officers  in
accordance  with the Company's cash incentive plan  and  the
2005  Equity  Incentive Compensation  Plan,  review  of  the

preparation  of  a  report  to  the  Company's  Compensation
Committee.

     (e)   (1)  Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy.  As  of
2006,  all  services  to  be  performed  for  registrant  by

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

The  Adams  Express  Company (Adams)  follows  long-standing
general  guidelines  for  the voting  of  portfolio  company
proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility to  vote
all   such  proxies.  The  portfolio  company  proxies   are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Adams uses its
own  staff  of research analysts and portfolio managers.  In
making  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  company  for   the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyses  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options

Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a  staggered  board of directors. In conformance  with  that
policy,  we  will  generally vote in  favor  of  shareholder
proposals to eliminate the staggered election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter  that  can be characterized as blatant anti-takeover
provisions.

With  respect  to  so-called golden parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within the authority of the company's management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually are persuaded management's  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance  with   management's
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

(a)  (1) Douglas  G.  Ober, Chairman and  Chief  Executive
     Officer, and Joseph M. Truta, President, comprise the 2
     person portfolio management team for the registrant. Mr.
     Ober and  Mr. Truta have  served as  portfolio managers
     for the registrant since 1991. This information  is  as
     of February 15,  2007.  Mr.  Ober is the lead member of
     the portfolio management team. Mr. Ober  and Mr.  Truta
     receive  investment  recommendations  from  a  team  of
     research analysts and make decisions jointly  about any
     equity transactions in  the portfolio.  Concurrence  of
     both portfolio  managers  is required for an investment
     recommendation to be approved.

     (2)   Mr.   Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  also  comprise   the
     portfolio   management  team  for   registrant's   non-
     controlled    affiliate,    Petroleum    &    Resources
     Corporation   (Petroleum),  a   registered   investment
     company  with  total  net assets  of $812,047,239 as of
     December   31,  2006.  Mr.  Ober  is  Chairman,   Chief
     Executive  Officer and President of Petroleum  and  Mr.
     Truta is Executive Vice President. This information  is
     as  of February 15, 2007. The Petroleum fund is a  non-
     diversified  fund  focusing on the energy  and  natural
     resources sectors and Adams is a diversified fund  with
     a   different   focus,  and  there  are  few   material
     conflicts  of  interest that may  arise  in  connection
     with  the portfolio managers' management of both funds.
     The  funds  do  not  buy or sell  securities  or  other
     portfolio   holdings  to  or  from   the   other,   and
     procedures  and  policies are  in  place  covering  the
     sharing  of  expenses and the allocation of  investment
     opportunities,    including    bunched    orders    and
     investments  in initial public offerings,  between  the
     funds.

     (3)   The portfolio managers are compensated through  a
     three-component plan, consisting of salary, annual cash
     incentive    compensation,   and    equity    incentive
     compensation.  The value of each component in any  year
     is  determined by the Compensation Committee, comprised
     solely of independent director members of the Board  of
     Directors.    Salaries   are   determined   by    using
     appropriate industry surveys and information about  the
     local  market as well as general inflation  statistics.
     Cash  incentive compensation is based on a  combination
     of  absolute and relative fund performance over one and
     three  year  periods as well as individual  success  at
     meeting  goals  and  objectives set  by  the  Board  of
     Directors  at  the  beginning  of  each  year.   Target
     incentives are set based on 80% of salary for the Chief
     Executive  Officer and 60% of salary for the President.
     Two-thirds  of each individual's annual cash  incentive
     is   based  on  fund  performance  and  one  third   on
     individual  success.  The portion based on  performance
     is  determined using a scale in which the target can be
     earned  by absolute fund pre- tax performance  of  10%.
     The  scale  ranges from zero to 125%  of  target.   The
     result  is then modified by an average of the  one  and
     three year performance relative to the S&P 500, whereby
     each one percent outperformance or underperformance  by
     the  fund  adds  or deducts 5% from the  percentage  of
     target   earned  based  on  the  scale.   The   maximum
     percentage  of target which may be earned is  200%  and
     the  minimum  is zero.  Equity incentive  compensation,
     based  on a plan approved by shareholders in 2005,  can
     take  several forms.  Following approval of  the  plan,
     grants  of  restricted stock were made to the portfolio
     managers   in  April  2005,  with  vesting   in   equal
     proportions over a three year period.  The size of  the
     grants  was  determined  by the Compensation  Committee
     with   the   assistance  of  an  outside   compensation
     consultant.  Grants of restricted stock were also  made
     on January 12, 2006, that will vest at the end of three
     years,  but  only  upon  the achievement  of  specified
     performance criteria; certain percentages of the target
     number  of  shares will be deemed to have  been  earned
     based  on  achieving performance goals  over  specified
     intervening  time  periods.   The  benchmark  used   to
     measure   performance   is  a  hypothetical   portfolio
     comprised of a 50/50 blend of the S&P 500 Index and the
     Lipper  Large Cap Core Mutual Fund Index ("Hypothetical
     Portfolio").  The first one-sixth of the target  number
     of  restricted  shares were earned on January  1,  2007
     because  the  Company's  one  year  total  NAV   return
     exceeded  the  one  year  total  NAV  return   of   the
     Hypothetical  Portfolio.   Lesser  percentages  or   no
     shares  would  have  been earned if the  Company's  NAV
     return  trailed  that  of  the Hypothetical  Portfolio,
     depending  on  the  level of underperformance  on  that
     date.   For the next one-third of the target number  of
     shares, those shares will be deemed to have been earned
     if,  on  January 1, 2008, the Company's two year  total
     NAV  return  meets or exceeds that of the  Hypothetical
     Portfolio, with a lesser percentage or no shares  being
     earned if the Company's total NAV return trails that of
     the  Hypothetical Portfolio, depending on the level  of
     underperformance  on that date.  The remaining  50%  of
     the  target  shares will be deemed to have been  earned
     if,  on January 1, 2009, the Company's three year total
     NAV  return  meets or exceeds that of the  Hypothetical
     Portfolio, with a lesser percentage or no shares  being
     earned if the Company's total NAV return trails that of
     the  Hypothetical Portfolio, depending on the level  of
     underperformance  on that date.  In  addition,  if,  on
     January  1,  2009, the Company's three year  total  NAV
     return  exceeds that of the Hypothetical Portfolio,  an
     additional  number of shares up to 50%  of  the  target
     number  of shares will be earned and vest depending  on
     the  level  of outperformance.  Dividends  and  capital
     gains  paid  on  the Company's shares of  Common  Stock
     ("dividends") will be paid on all of the target  number
     of  shares of restricted stock, when such dividends are
     paid  on the Common Stock, except that no dividends  or
     capital  gains  will  be paid on any  shares  that  are
     forfeited due to the failure to achieve the performance
     criteria  described above.  The basis for the portfolio
     managers'   cash   incentive   and   equity   incentive
     compensation determinations for Petroleum is  the  same
     as  for  Adams,  except that the portion  of  the  cash
     incentive  based  upon fund performance  uses  the  Dow
     Jones  Oil and Gas Index and the S&P 500 Index  as  the
     benchmarks  in  a 70%/30% ratio, over a one  and  three
     year  period,  and the benchmarks used to measure  fund
     performance  for  equity incentive  compensation  is  a
     hypothetical  portfolio comprised of a 80/20  blend  of
     the  Dow Jones Oil and Gas Index and the S&P 500 Index.
     All  of  the  above information is as of  December  31,
     2006, except as noted.

     (4)    Using a valuation date of December 31, 2006, Mr.
     Ober  beneficially owns equity securities in registrant
     of over $1,000,000.  Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity
     securities in registrant of over $1,000,000.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 15, 2007, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation, the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  15, 2007, the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.
