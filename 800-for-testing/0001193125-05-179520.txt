ITEM 1.   REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

          The Semi-Annual Report to Stockholders follows.

<PAGE>

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

    Performance Review: Your Fund had a total return (market price change plus
income) of 9.7% for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. In comparison, the S&P
Utilities Index had a total return of 9.3%. A composite of the S&P Utilities
Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index, reflecting the stock and bond ratio of
the Fund, had a total return of 8.3%.

    During the second quarter of 2005, your Fund paid three monthly 6.5 cent
dividends. The 6.5 cent per share monthly rate, without compounding, would be
78 cents annualized, or a 6.75% common stock dividend yield based on the June
30, 2005 closing price of $11.56 per share. That yield compares favorably with
the quarter-end yields of 3.06% on the Dow Jones Utility Index and 3.28% on the
S&P Utilities Index. Please see the Board of Directors meeting section below
for more information about the Fund's dividends.

    On a longer-term basis, as of June 30, 2005, your Fund had a three-year
cumulative total return of 43.5%. In comparison, the S&P Utilities Index had a
total return during that period of 47.3%, while a composite of the S&P
Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index, reflecting the stock and
bond ratio of the Fund, had a total return of 40.0%.

    A paradox within a conundrum: Earlier this year, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan surprised investors and economists alike by calling the current
interest rate environment a conundrum. The surprise was not that the practice
of economic theory and monetary policy are inexact, of which investors were
already aware, but that the learned and consummately articulate leader of the
United States central bank acknowledged that the reasons for recent movements
in long-term interest rates were not readily explained by historic precedent.

    In an attempt to moderate economic growth to a level consistent with
contained inflation, the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest
rates in June 2004. Through July 2005, the federal funds rate has been raised
incrementally 8 times for a total of 225 basis points (21/4 percentage points).
Historically, increases in short-term rates have always pushed up long-term
rates. Chairman Greenspan's conundrum is that, over the same period that
short-term rates have risen by 225 basis points, yields on 10-year and 30-year
U.S. Treasury securities have actually fallen by 38 and 87 basis points,
respectively.

    Paradoxically, long-term interest rates have fallen as economic growth and,
to a lesser extent, inflation have accelerated. Incoming economic data indicate
that the economy ended

<PAGE>

the second quarter of 2005 on very solid ground, continuing the trend of the
last two years. Second quarter 2005 real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by
3.4%, and was accompanied by a 5.8% surge in final domestic sales, a measure of
domestic demand excluding the effects of the change in inventories. If
businesses increase production to compensate for the implied sizable inventory
reduction, the economy could be poised for robust growth in the second half of
the year.

    Various explanations have been offered for the conundrum. Perhaps investors
are demanding less of an inflation risk premium than in the past as a vote of
confidence for monetary policy makers, or as an acknowledgement of the
inflation suppressing effects of global competition. Another plausible
explanation is that foreign investors are depressing long-term interest rates
by recycling vast amounts of energy and other dollar-denominated export
earnings into the U.S. fixed income markets, where they can earn relatively
high interest rates on relatively safe investments compared to the rest of the
developed world.

    Whatever explanations the passage of time and the good judgment of market
participants validate, your Fund managers understand investor desire for income
from conservative investments. We will continue to pursue opportunities that
meet the Fund's primary objective--income.

    The Energy Bill: After several attempts over recent years, the U.S.
Congress has enacted comprehensive energy legislation. Passage of the Energy
Bill was spurred by strong backing from the White House, as the President has
made energy reform a priority. This is the most wide-ranging energy legislation
in almost fifteen years. The massive bill addresses a multitude of issues,
including oil and gas production tax credits, refinery expansions, ethanol
production, hybrid vehicle purchases, and even daylight-savings time. The
biggest criticism of the bill has been that it is not expected to provide
immediate relief for record-high energy prices. The areas of the bill that have
the most important implications for your Fund are the very comprehensive
provisions specific to the utility industry. Various titles of the bill address
a broad range of utility-related subjects, including electricity, energy
efficiency, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and coal.

    From the perspective of both the electric and gas utility sectors the bill
has several potentially positive components. The main benefit for utility
companies is an increased certainty in terms of regulatory oversight,
tax-incentives, and future capital investment.

                                      2

<PAGE>

Specifically, the bill addresses issues related to transmission reliability and
siting, utility mergers and acquisitions, clean coal technologies, energy tax
incentives, and nuclear energy research.

    The bill is particularly strong in addressing electricity
transmission--moving high voltages over long distances. Transmission system
reliability is supported by encouraging investments for maintenance and
expansion. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is given authority
over mandatory reliability rules and the ability to site transmission lines in
national interest corridors. The bill also allows for the tax deferral of any
gains associated with the sale of transmission assets to an independent
transmission organization.

    The bill codifies a variety of tax incentives, including accelerated
depreciation provisions for electric transmission and natural gas distribution
infrastructure investments as well as pollution control equipment. The
production tax credits for renewables are extended, and a 20% tax credit is
provided for certain clean coal technologies.

    Favorable for the nuclear energy industry, liability protections for
facility construction are extended through 2016. The Department of Energy is
required to propose a permanent nuclear waste disposal facility within one
year. The bill also enhances nuclear security provisions, and a research
program for new nuclear reactor technologies is established.

    The bill accomplishes the long debated repeal of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUHCA). As a result, the SEC will no longer have jurisdiction over
utility holding company mergers. It should be easier now for non-utility
companies to buy utilities and allow more geographically dispersed utility
combinations. However, merger activity may remain limited because state
regulatory agencies still have significant approval authority. Additionally,
the bill gives the FERC extended authority over M&A activities. The FERC is
required to use a public interest standard when evaluating mergers and must
also consider market power issues. A positive aspect for potential mergers is
that the FERC is required to establish rules that provide for an expeditious
review of merger applications.

    Although the effects of the Energy Bill are wide ranging, the investment
implications must be determined on a sector-by-sector and company-by-company
basis. Your Fund managers and analysts will continue to do fundamental research
and select investments for

                                      3

your portfolio that are best suited to meet Fund objectives. The graph below is

    Board of Directors Meeting: At the regular August 2005 Board of Directors'
meeting, the Board declared the following monthly dividends:

                   --------------- ------------ ------------
                   <S>             <C>          <C>
                         6.5       September 30 October 11
                         6.5       October 31   November 10
                         6.5       November 30  December 12
</TABLE>

    The determination of the character of all Fund distributions (specifying
which portion is ordinary income, qualifying dividend income, short or long
term capital gains, or return of capital) is made each year-end and is reported
to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed every year in late January.

    At the February 2005 meeting, the Board reviewed the Fund's dividend policy
and reaffirmed the current 6.5 cents per share per month dividend rate.
Interest rates remain near

                                      4

<PAGE>

40-year lows, despite recent Federal Reserve actions, and utility common stock
dividends are well below their long-term average. Since 2004, the Fund has made
increased use of realized gains to supplement its investment income and has
reduced its use of short-term trading strategies designed to capture dividend
income. Until the Fund utilizes all of its tax loss carryforwards,
distributions to shareholders are expected to be treated as ordinary income for
tax purposes. In addition, the reduced use of short-term trading strategies by
the Fund has lowered the Fund's portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (UNAUDITED)
                                 June 30, 2005

(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

   DNP SELECT INCOME FUND INC. (the "Fund") was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Maryland on November 26, 1986. The Fund commenced operations on
January 21, 1987, as a closed-end diversified management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The primary investment
objectives of the Fund are current income and long-term growth of income.
Capital appreciation is a secondary objective.

   The following are the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

      (a) The market values for securities are determined as follows: Equity
   securities traded on a national securities exchange or traded
   over-the-counter and quoted on the NASDAQ System are valued at last sales
   prices. Fixed income securities and any other securities for which it is
   determined that market prices are unavailable or inappropriate are valued at
   a fair value using a procedure determined in good faith by the Board of
   Directors which includes the use of a pricing service. Each money market
   instrument having a maturity of 60 days or less is valued on an amortized
   cost basis, which approximates market value.

      (b) Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury, U.S.
   Government Agency and other investment grade securities. All collateral is
   held by an independent third-party custodian bank on behalf of the Fund
   until maturity of the repurchase agreement. Provisions of the agreement
   provide that the market value of the collateral plus accrued interest on the
   collateral is greater than or equal to the repurchase price plus accrued
   interest at all times. In the event of a default or bankruptcy by the other
   party to the agreements, the Fund maintains the right to sell the underlying
   collateral securities at market value; however realization and/or retention
   of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

      (c) It is the Fund's policy to comply with requirements of Subchapter M
   of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies
   and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
   shareholders. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.
   The Fund intends to utilize provisions of Federal income tax laws which
   allow a realized capital loss to be carried forward for eight years
   following the year of loss. At December 31, 2004, the Fund had tax capital
   loss carry forwards of $288,053,758 of which $924,278 will expire in 2007;
   $76,055,964 will expire in 2010 and $211,073,516 will expire in 2011. These
   capital loss carryforwards will be reduced by future realized gains, whether
   or not distributed (see Note 4). The Fund incurred losses in November and
   December 2004 of $3,868,218 which will be deferred for tax purposes and
   treated as if they were incurred on January 1, 2005.

      At December 31, 2004, on a tax basis, the Fund had undistributed net
   investment income of $0 and based on a $2,776,340,015 tax cost of
   investments, gross unrealized appreciation of $365,962,302 and unrealized
   depreciation of $32,560,868. The difference between the book basis and tax
   basis of distributable earnings and cost of investments are primarily a
   result of tax deferral of wash sale losses, the accretion of market discount
   and amortization of premiums and alternative tax treatment of certain
   securities.

      Due to inherent differences in the recognition and distribution of income
   and realized gains/losses under U.S. generally accepted accounting
   principles and for federal income tax purposes, permanent

                                 June 30, 2005

   differences between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and
   appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The
   reclassifications primarily relate to premium amortization and capital loss
   carryforwards utilized for current year distributions. These
   reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value of the Fund. At June
   30, 2005 the following reclassifications were recorded:

      Paid-in Surplus   loss on investments      net investment income

</TABLE>

      (d) Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains
   or losses from sales of securities are determined on the specific identified
   cost basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest
   income and expense are recognized on the accrual basis. Discounts and
   premiums on securities are amortized over the lives of the respective
   securities for financial reporting purposes. Discounts and premiums are not
   amortized for tax purposes.

      (e) The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
   generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
   liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
   of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
   decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
   results could differ from those estimates.

(2) MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS:

   The Fund has engaged Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. (the "Adviser")
to provide professional investment management services for the Fund and has
engaged J. J. B. Hilliard, W. L. Lyons, Inc. (the "Administrator") to provide
administrative and management services for the Fund. The Adviser receives a
quarterly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the average weekly net assets of the
Fund up to $1.5 billion and .50% of average weekly net assets in excess
thereof. The Administrator receives a quarterly fee at annual rates of .25% of
average weekly net assets up to $100 million, .20% of average weekly net assets
from $100 million to $1 billion, and .10% of average weekly net assets over $1
billion. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, "average weekly net
assets" is defined as the sum of (i) the aggregate net asset value of the
Fund's common stock (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of the Fund's
preferred stock and (iii) the aggregate proceeds to the Fund of commercial
paper issued by the Fund. Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the Adviser
receive a fee of $25,000 per year plus $2,000 per board meeting, plus $1,500
per committee meeting attended. Committee chairmen receive an additional fee of
$5,000 per year. Beginning May 23, 2005, the chairman of the board receives an
additional fee of $50,000 per year. Total fees paid to directors for the six
months ended June 30, 2005 were $198,393.

(3) INDEMNIFICATIONS:

   Under the Fund's organizational documents, its Officers and Directors are
indeminified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business,

                                 June 30, 2005

the Fund enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have
not yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant
to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

(4) DIVIDENDS:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the following distributions to common
stockholders in 2005:

                          06-30-05 07-11-05    .065
</TABLE>

The Fund declares and pays dividends monthly. The amount and timing of
distributions are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (See Note
(1)(c)). The tax basis of all Fund distributions in 2004 was ordinary income.
Until the Fund utilizes all of its tax loss carryforwards, distributions to
shareholders are expected to be treated as ordinary income for federal income
tax purposes.

(5) REMARKETED PREFERRED STOCK:

   In 1988, the Fund issued 5,000 shares of Remarketed Preferred Stock ("RP")
in five series of 1,000 shares each at a public offering price of $100,000 per
share. The underwriting discount and other expenses incurred in connection with
the issuance of the RP were recorded as a reduction of paid-in surplus on
common stock. Dividends on the RP are cumulative at a rate which was initially
established for each series at its offering. Since the initial offering of each
series, the dividend rate on each series has been reset every 49 days by a
remarketing process. Dividend rates ranged from 2.00% to 3.40% during the six
months ended June 30, 2005.

   The RP is redeemable at the option of the Fund on any dividend payment date
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect
to the RP, and the RP is subject to mandatory redemption if that asset coverage
is not maintained. Each series of RP is also subject to mandatory redemption on
a date certain as follows: Series A--November 28, 2012; Series B--November 18,
2015; Series C--November 7, 2018; Series D--December 22, 2021; and Series
E--December 11, 2024.

                                 June 30, 2005


   In general, the holders of the RP and of the Common Stock have equal voting
rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the RP, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Directors, and separate class votes
are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests of the RP
and the Common Stock. The RP has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(6) COMMERCIAL PAPER:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the Fund to issue up to $200,000,000
of Commercial Paper Notes (the "Notes") in minimum denominations of $100,000
with maturities up to 270 days. The Notes generally will be sold on a discount
basis, but may be sold on an interest-bearing basis. The Notes are not
redeemable by the Fund nor are they subject to voluntary prepayment prior to
maturity. The aggregate amount of Notes outstanding changes from time to time.
The Notes are unsecured, general obligations of the Fund. The Fund has entered
into a credit agreement to provide liquidity. The Fund is able to request loans
under the credit agreement of up to $100,000,000 at any one time, subject to
certain restrictions. Interest rates on the Notes ranged from 2.60% to 3.48%
during the six months ended June 30, 2005. At June 30, 2005 the Fund had Notes
outstanding with a par value of $200,000,000 and had received proceeds of
$197,972,806.

(7) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS:

   For the six months ended June 30, 2005 purchases and sales of investment
securities (excluding short-term securities) were $434,634,301 and
$460,008,342, respectively.

   The Fund may lend portfolio securities to a broker/dealer. Loans are
required to be secured at all times by collateral at least equal to the market
value of securities loaned. The Fund receives a portion of the income earned on
the securities held as collateral and continues to earn income on the loaned
securities. Security loans are subject to the risk of failure by the borrower
to return the loaned securities in which case the Fund could incur a loss. At
June 30, 2005 the Fund had loaned portfolio securities with a market value of
$509,720,050 and received $526,878,180 of cash collateral. This cash was
invested in securities as shown in the Schedule of Investments.

                   Renewal of Investment Advisory Agreement

Under Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), the
terms of the Fund's investment advisory agreement must be reviewed and approved
at least annually by the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board"),
including a majority of the directors who are not "interested persons" of the
Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent Directors"). Section 15(c)
of the 1940 Act also requires the Fund's directors to request and evaluate, and
the Fund's investment adviser to furnish, such information as may reasonably be
necessary to evaluate the terms of the investment advisory agreement. The Board
has a Contracts Committee, composed entirely of Independent Directors, which,
assisted by the advice of independent legal counsel, conducts an annual review
of the terms of the Fund's contractual arrangements, including the Fund's
investment advisory agreement with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., the
Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser"). In the course of that review, the
members of the Contracts Committee considered all of the information they
deemed appropriate, including informational materials furnished by the Adviser
in response to a request made by the Committee. In arriving at its
recommendation that continuation of the investment advisory agreement was in
the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders, the Contracts Committee
took into account all factors that it deemed relevant, without identifying any
single factor or group of factors as all-important or controlling. Among the
factors considered by the Contracts Committee, and the conclusion reached with
respect to each, were the following:

Nature, extent, and quality of services.  The Committee considered the nature,
extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the Adviser. In
evaluating the quality of the Adviser's services, the Committee noted the
various complexities involved in the operations of the Fund, such as the use of
two types of leverage and the lending of portfolio securities, and concluded
that the Adviser is consistently providing high-quality services to the Fund in
an increasingly complex environment. The Committee also considered the length
of service of the individual professional employees of the Adviser who provide
services to the Fund and noted an almost total lack of turnover. In the
Committee's view, the long-term service of capable and conscientious
professionals provides a significant benefit to the Fund and its shareholders.
The Committee also considered the Fund's investment performance as discussed
below. In light of the foregoing, the Committee concluded that it was generally
satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the
Fund by the Adviser.

Investment performance of the Fund and the Adviser.  The Committee reviewed the
Fund's investment performance over time and compared that performance to
various peer groups and indices. The Committee concluded that since current
income is the Fund's primary objective, one of the best measures of the
Adviser's performance is the Fund's consistent ability to pay a 6.5 cent per
share monthly dividend. The Committee also considered the fact that since 1990,
shares of the Fund have traded at a premium to net asset value over 94% of the
time even though shares of most closed-end funds trade at a discount to net
asset value as further evidence of the Adviser's successful management of the
Fund's investment portfolio.

Cost of services and profits realized.  The Committee considered the
reasonableness of the compensation paid to the Adviser, in both absolute and
comparative terms, and also the profits realized by the Adviser and its
affiliates from its relationship with the Fund. To facilitate this analysis,
the Committee retained Lipper Analytical Services Inc., an independent provider
of investment company data, to furnish a report comparing the Fund's advisory
fee and other expenses to the similar expenses of other comparable funds. The
Committee noted that many of the other funds in the comparison group were only
recently established, and benefited from waivers of advisory fees by their
sponsors. The Committee's view is that gross fees provide a more useful
comparison

                                      24

<PAGE>

because waivers tend to be associated with the launch of new funds and can be
expected to be of short duration. The Fund's fees, while higher than the
comparison group median when waivers were included, were lower than the median
when waivers were excluded. The Committee also received comparative information
from the Adviser with respect to the fees it charges to investment advisory
clients other than the Fund. However, the Committee concluded that the services
rendered to other institutional investor clients were not sufficiently
comparable to the services rendered to the Fund for a direct comparison of
advisory fees to be meaningful. The Committee also examined the profitability
of the investment advisory agreement to the Adviser and determined that the
profitability was within the range that courts had found reasonable. The
Committee considered that the Adviser must be able to compensate its employees
at competitive levels in order to attract and retain high-quality personnel to
provide high-quality service to the Fund. The Committee concluded that the
investment advisory agreement was the product of arm's length bargaining and
that it was fair and reasonable to the Fund.

Economies of scale.  The Committee considered whether the Fund has
appropriately benefited from any economies of scale. The Committee noted the
breakpoints whereby the advisory fee is reduced at higher asset levels and
concluded that any economies of scale are being shared between Fund
shareholders and the Adviser in an appropriate manner.

Indirect benefits.  The Committee considered the indirect benefits the Adviser
derives from its relationship with the Fund, including brokerage and soft
dollar arrangements. In this regard, the Committee noted that the Fund does not
utilize affiliates of the Adviser for brokerage purposes, that the Adviser had
significantly reduced the Fund's brokerage cost in 2004 and that the Adviser
was in the process of phasing out the use of soft dollar arrangements.

The Contracts Committee concluded, based upon its evaluation of all material
factors, including the foregoing, and assisted by the advice of independent
legal counsel, that the existing advisory fee structure is fair and reasonable,
and recommended the continuation of the investment advisory agreement as being
in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. On February 18, 2005,
the Committee presented its recommendation, and the criteria on which it was
based, to the full Board, whereupon the Board, including the Independent
Directors, accepted the Committee's recommendation and approved the
continuation of the Fund's investment advisory agreement for an additional
one-year term ending April 30, 2006.
