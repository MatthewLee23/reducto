1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation is an internally-managed fund emphasizing petroleum and other
natural resource investments. The investment objectives of the Corporation are
preservation of capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments,
and an opportunity for capital appreciation.

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require the use of estimates made by Corporation management. Management
believes that estimates and security valuations are appropriate; however,
actual results may differ from those estimates, and the security valuations
reflected in the financial statements may differ from the value the Corporation
ultimately realizes upon sale of the securities.

Security Transactions and Investment Income--Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to stockholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

Security Valuation--Investments in securities traded on national security
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value.
Purchased and written options are valued at the last quoted asked price.

The Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("FAS 157"),
effective January 1, 2008. There was no impact on the fair value of assets
individually or in aggregate upon adoption. In accordance with FAS 157, fair
value is defined as the price that the Corporation would receive upon selling
an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer. FAS 157
established a three-tier hierarchy to establish classification of fair value
measurements, summarized as follows:

  .   Level 1 -- fair value is determined based on market data obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices in active markets for
      identical investments,
  .   Level 2 -- fair value is determined using other assumptions obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices for similar investments,
  .   Level 3 -- fair value is determined using the Corporation's own
      assumptions, developed based on the best information available in the
      circumstances.

The Corporation's investments at June 30, 2008 are classified as follows:

*Comprised of short-term investments and securities lending collateral.

2.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
stockholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2008 was $556,791,203 and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $733,685,946, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $736,359,498 and $2,673,552 respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Corporation's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations. Any
income tax-related interest or penalties would be classified as income tax
expense.

3.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee of management,
and recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2008 were $114,005,745 and
$84,818,249, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. When the Corporation writes an option, an

                                                                             5

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


amount equal to the premium received by the Corporation is recorded as a
liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current fair value of the option
written. Premiums received from unexercised put/call options are treated as
realized gains from investments, premiums received from exercised put options
reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased, and premiums received from
exercised call options are added to the proceeds from the sale of the
underlying security in determining whether there is a realized gain or loss.
The Corporation as writer of an option bears the risks of possible illiquidity
of the option markets and the unfavorable change in the price of the security
underlying the written option. The risk is limited to the premium originally
paid for the option. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30,
2008 can be found on page 12.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2008 were as follows:

5.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
covers all employees with at least one year of service. In addition, the
Corporation has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan which
provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Changes in the prior service costs and accumulated actuarial gains and losses
are recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of net
assets, in the year in which the changes occur.

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended
June 30, 2008, the Corporation contributed $15,604 to the plans and expects to
contribute up to $500,000 to the plans during the remainder of 2008.

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the

6.  EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Corporation during subsequent
years. All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years
from date of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2008, and
changes during the six month period then ended is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $222,330.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based
restricted stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of
a specified three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned
contingent on achievement of certain performance targets. If performance
targets are not achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based awards are
forfeited and become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based
restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three year period and
nonperformance-based restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors)
vest over a one year period. It is the current intention that employee grants
will be performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in
the event of death or retirement. Non-employee directors also may elect to
defer a portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be
paid by delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at
fair market value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which
remain available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at June 30, 2008 is
825,137 shares.

A summary of the status of the Corporations's awards granted under the 2005
Plan as of June 30, 2008, and changes during the six month period then ended is

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on

the most probable outcome and, if such goals are not met, compensation cost is
not recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The
total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to employees for the
period ended June 30, 2008 were $196,421. The total compensation costs for
restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors for the period ended
June 30, 2008 were $79,392. As of June 30, 2008, there were total unrecognized
compensation costs of $611,807, a component of additional capital surplus,
related to nonvested equity-based compensation arrangements granted under the
2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.70 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the six
month period ended June 30, 2008 was $146,792.

7.  OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

The aggregate remuneration paid during the six months ended June 30, 2008 to
officers and directors amounted to $1,782,192, of which $198,607 was paid as
fees and compensation to directors who were not officers. These amounts
represent the taxable income to the Corporation's officers and directors and
therefore differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of
Operations that are recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

8.  PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues
to receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are
secured at all times by collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the
securities loaned plus accrued interest. The market value of the loaned
securities is calculated based upon the most recent closing prices and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Corporation on the next
business day. Gain or loss in the fair value of securities loaned that may
occur during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Corporation.
At June 30, 2008, the Corporation had securities on loan of $143,104,209 and
held collateral of $145,526,187, consisting of an investment trust fund which
may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.
                               -----------------

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF PETROLEUM & RESOURCES CORPORATION:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(the "Corporation") at June 30, 2008, the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for each of the periods
presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at June 30, 2008 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which

board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item  407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR  229.407)  (as
required  by Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-
101)), or this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As  of July  22, 2008, an evaluation  was  performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
July  22,  2008, the  registrant's  disclosure  controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.



A  certification  by  the registrant's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer, pursuant to Section
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is attached.


Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange  Act
of  1934  and  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed  on  its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
