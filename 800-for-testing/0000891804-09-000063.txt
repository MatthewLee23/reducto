Chairman's
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS


|  Robert P. Bremner  |  Chairman of the Board


Dear Shareholders,

I'd like to use my initial letter to you to accomplish several things.  First, I
want to report  that  after  fourteen  years of service  on your  Fund's  Board,
including the last twelve as chairman,  Tim Schwertfeger  retired from the Board
in June. The Board has elected me to replace him as the chairman, the first time
this  role  has  been  filled  by  someone  who  is not an  employee  of  Nuveen
Investments.  Electing an independent chairman marks a significant  milestone in
the  management  of your Fund,  and it aligns us with what is now  considered  a
"best practice" in the fund industry.  Further, it demonstrates the independence
with which your Board has always acted on your behalf.

Following Tim will not be easy.  During my eleven  previous  years on the Nuveen
Fund  Board,  I found  that Tim  always set a very high  standard  by  combining
insightful  industry and market knowledge and sound,  clear judgment.  While the
Board  will miss his wise  counsel,  I am certain  we will  retain  the  primary
commitment  Tim shared with all of us - an unceasing  dedication to creating and
retaining value for Nuveen Fund shareholders. This focus on value over time is a
touchstone  that I and all the other  Board  members  will  continue to use when
making decisions on your behalf.

Second,  I also want to report  that we are very  fortunate  to welcome  two new
Board members to our team. John Amboian,  the current chairman and CEO of Nuveen
Investments,  has replaced Tim as Nuveen's  representative on the Board.  John's
presence will allow the  independent  Board members to benefit not only from his
leadership role at Nuveen but also his broad  understanding of the fund industry
and  Nuveen's  role  within  it.  We also  added  Terry  Toth as an  independent
director.  A former CEO of the Northern Trust Company's asset management  group,
Terry will bring extensive experience in the fund industry to our deliberations.

Third,  on  behalf of the  entire  Board,  I would  like you to know that we are
closely monitoring the unprecedented  market  developments and their distressing
impact on the Funds.  We believe  that these Funds  continue to be actively  and
constructively  managed for the long term and at the same time we are very aware
that these are trying times for our  investors.  We appreciate  the patience you
have  shown  with the Board and with  Nuveen  Investments  as they  manage  your
investment through this extremely difficult period.

Fourth, again on behalf of the entire Board, I would like to acknowledge the
effort the whole Nuveen organization is making to resolve the auction rate
preferred share situation in a satisfactory manner. As you know, we are actively
pursuing a number of possible solutions, all with the goal of providing
liquidity for preferred shareholders while preserving the potential benefits of
leverage for common shareholders. We appreciate the patience you have shown as
we've worked through the many difficulties involved.

Finally, I urge you to take the time to review the Portfolio Manager's Comments,
the Common  Share  Dividend  and Share Price  Information,  and the  Performance
Overview  sections of this report.  All of us are grateful  that you have chosen
Nuveen  Investments  as a partner as you pursue your  financial  goals,  and, on
behalf of myself and the other members of your Fund's Board,  let me say we look
forward to continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Bremner

Robert P. Bremner
Chairman of the Board

Portfolio Manager's COMMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                              | NQI, NIO, NIF,
Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds | NPX, NVG, NEA

Portfolio  manager Paul Brennan  discusses  U.S.  economic and municipal  market
conditions,  key investment strategies and the twelve-month performance of these
six insured  Funds.  With  nineteen  years of investment  experience,  including
eleven years at Nuveen,  Paul assumed portfolio  management  responsibility  for
NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG and NEA in 2006.

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE
TWELVE-MONTH REPORTING PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2008?

During this period, stress in the financial and credit markets led to increased
price volatility for many securities, reduced liquidity and a general flight to
quality. The Federal Reserve (Fed) began in September 2007 a series of interest
rate cuts that lowered the fed funds rate by 325 basis points--from 5.25% to
2.00%--over an eight-month period ending April 2008. In October 2008, the Fed
announced two additional reductions of 50 basis points each, bringing the fed
funds rate down to 1.00%, its lowest level since 2003. (On December 16, after
the end of this twelve-month period, the Fed reduced the fed funds rate target
to 0.25% or less.)

The Fed's rate-cutting actions also were a response to concerns about the pace
of U.S. economic growth, as measured by the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).
After declining at an annual rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2007, GDP
improved to a positive 0.9% in the first quarter of 2008 and posted growth of
2.8% in the second quarter of 2008 (all GDP numbers annualized). During the
third quarter of 2008, however, GDP contracted at an annual rate of 0.5%, the
biggest decrease since 2001, mainly as the result of the first decline in
consumer spending since 1991 and an 18% drop in residential investment. The
Consumer Price Index (CPI), driven largely by increased energy, food and
transportation prices, registered a 3.7% year-over-year gain as of October 2008,
while the core CPI (which excludes food and energy) rose 2.2% over this same
period, above the Fed's unofficial target of 2.0% or lower. In the labor
markets, October 2008 marked the tenth consecutive month of job losses. The
national unemployment rate for October 2008 was 6.5%, its highest point in more
than fourteen years, up from 4.8% in October 2007.

In the municipal bond market, performance was significantly impacted by concerns
about the credit markets, downgrades of municipal bond insurers, failed auctions
of preferred shares and institutional investors' need to unwind various
leveraging strategies. These events created surges of selling pressure,
especially in late September and early October 2008. While some investors
curtailed purchases, non-traditional buyers of

municipal bonds such as hedge funds, traditional buyers such as tax-exempt money
market funds, and institutions were forced to sell holdings of longer-maturity
bonds into a market already experiencing reduced liquidity.

Combined with the Fed rate cuts, this selling produced a sharp steepening of the
municipal yield curve, as longer-term interest rates rose and short-term rates
declined over this period. In this environment, bonds with shorter maturities
generally outperformed longer maturity bonds and higher quality bonds tended to
outperform lower quality credits.

Another item of note in the municipal market was the U.S. Supreme Court's May
2008 ruling that individual states could continue to offer their residents
special tax treatment on municipal bonds issued within their borders. The high
court's decision preserved tax rules in forty-two states, allowing them to
continue to exempt from taxation the income their residents earn on in-state
municipal bonds while taxing the income earned on municipal bonds issued in
other states.

Over the twelve months ended October 31, 2008, municipal bond issuance
nationwide totaled $450.3 billion, a drop of 8% from the previous twelve months.
The decrease during the month of October 2008 was more dramatic, with new
issuance down more than 50% from that of October 2007. In 2008, insured bonds
have comprised less than 20% of new supply, compared with the recent historical
figure of approximately 50%. While market conditions during this period impacted
the demand for municipal bonds, we continued to see demand from investors
attracted by higher interest rates and yields relative to taxable bonds.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS?

During this twelve-month period, with the municipal market characterized by
volatility and a relatively steep yield curve, we sought to capitalize on a
turbulent environment by continuing to focus on finding relative value by
investing for the long term, preserving and enhancing liquidity, and managing
duration(1) risk.

As events in the general financial markets unfolded, we found attractive
opportunities in various sectors of the municipal bond market, using a
fundamental approach to identify undervalued sectors and individual credits with
the potential to perform well over the long term. It is important to note that,
during this reporting period, our strategies for these insured Funds were
designed to mitigate some of the uncertainty surrounding bond insurers (please
view page 8 for more complete detail). In addition, some portfolio activity was
driven by our efforts to boost liquidity or cash reserves. Especially during the
commotion of September and October, we believed it was prudent to take defensive
measures that would reduce the Funds' exposure to market risk. These measures
included pre-emptively selling some holdings and raising the Funds' cash
reserves.

Throughout the period, we selectively sold some holdings with shorter durations,
including pre-refunded(2) bonds. We also took advantage of strong bids to sell
bonds

(1)  Duration  is a measure of a bond's  price  sensitivity  as  interest  rates
change,  with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these changes
than bonds with shorter durations.

(2) Pre-refundings, also known as advance refundings or refinancings, occur when
an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund  principal  and interest
payments of older existing bonds.  This process often results in lower borrowing
costs for bond issuers.

                                                                            ----
                                                                             5
                                                                            ----

that were attractive to the retail market. Given the market environment,
retail demand was often strongest for higher credit quality bonds. At all times,
we were careful to balance our efforts to enhance liquidity through sales to the
retail market with our focus on maintaining the credit quality of our portfolios
in an uncertain market.

As a key dimension of risk management, we employed a disciplined approach to
duration positioning as an important component of our overall strategy. As part
of this approach, we used inverse floating rate securities(3), in all of these
Funds. Inverse floaters typically provide the dual benefit of bringing the
Funds' durations closer to our strategic target and enhancing their
income-generation capabilities.

HOW DID THE FUNDS PERFORM?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as relevant index and peer group
information, are presented in the accompanying table.

Funds underperformed the Barclays Capital Insured Municipal Bond Index and the
Standard & Poor's (S&P) National Municipal Bond Index.

(3) An inverse floating rate security is a financial  instrument designed to pay
long-term  tax-exempt interest at a rate that varies inversely with a short-term
tax-exempt  interest rate index.  For the Nuveen Funds, the index typically used
is the Securities  Industry and Financial  Markets  (SIFM)  Municipal Swap Index
(previously  referred to as the Bond Market  Association Index or BMA).  Inverse
floaters,  including  those inverse  floating rate securities in which the Funds
invested during this reporting  period,  are further defined within the Notes to
Financial  Statements and Glossary of Terms Used in this Report sections of this
shareholder report.

(4) The Lipper  Insured  Municipal  Debt Funds Average is  calculated  using the
returns of all  closed-end  funds in this category (all of which are  leveraged)
for each period as follows:  1 year, 23 funds; 5 years, 21 funds;  and 10 years,
16 funds. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of dividends.

(5) The Barclays Capital (formerly Lehman Brothers) Insured Municipal Bond Index
is an unleveraged,  unmanaged national index comprising a broad range of insured

each Fund's performance over this period was the use of leverage. The impact of
leverage is discussed in more detail on page eight.

Over the period, bonds with maturities of ten years or less outperformed the
market as a whole, with bonds maturing in one to six years generally benefiting
the most, while bonds with the longest maturities (twenty-two years and longer)
posted the worst returns. During this period, the Funds' varying levels of
exposure to the longer part of the yield curve had a major influence on their
performances relative to one another. NQI, for example, had the greatest
exposure to the underperforming longer part of the curve, which hurt its
performance. Conversely, NVG benefited from having the shortest duration among
these Funds.

In addition, the inverse floaters used by all six of these Funds generally had a
negative impact on performance. This resulted from the fact that the inverse
floaters effectively increased the Funds' exposure to longer maturity bonds at a
time when shorter maturities were in favor in the market.

Credit exposure, especially exposure to bonds backed by municipal bond insurers,
also was a factor in performance during this period. Because risk-averse
investors generally sought higher quality investments as disruptions in the
financial markets deepened, bonds with higher credit quality ratings typically
performed very well. At the same time, as many investors avoided high-yield
securities, bonds rated BBB or below and non-rated bonds generally posted poor
returns. As of October 31, 2008, NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX all had small holdings
(approximately 1.5% or less) of BBB rated bonds. This exposure was generally the
result of rating downgrades on certain municipal bond insurers over the past
twelve months, rather than the result of any buying by these Funds. NEA, which
can invest up to 20% of their assets in uninsured investment-grade quality
securities, held approximately 2% in bonds rated BBB as of October 31, 2008. The
impact of these lower-rated holdings varied. Insured bonds with underlying
credits that were rated BBB or non-rated, originally purchased because of the
higher yields they offered and the attractiveness of the underlying credit,
experienced a disproportionately negative impact (compared with bonds with
underlying credits rated AA or A) if the insurer backing the bond was downgraded
from AAA.

Sectors of the market that generally helped the Funds' performances included
general obligation bonds, water and sewer, and utilities. Pre-refunded bonds,
which are backed by U.S. Treasury securities, were one of the top performing
segments of the market, due primarily to their shorter effective maturities,
higher credit quality and perceived safety. Holdings of pre-refunded bonds
ranged from 22% to 32% among these Funds, with NIO and NVG having the heaviest
weightings of these issues and NQI the smallest.

In general, bonds that carried any credit risk, regardless of sector, continued
to post weak performance. Revenue bonds as a whole, and the industrial
development sector

                                                                            ----

in particular, underperformed the general municipal market. Next to the
industrial development sector, zero coupon bonds were among the worst performing
categories, followed by the health care and housing sectors.

IMPACT OF THE FUNDS' CAPITAL STRUCTURES AND LEVERAGE STRATEGIES ON PERFORMANCE

In addition to the factors mentioned above, one of the primary factors
negatively impacting the annual returns of these Funds relative to those of the
unleveraged indexes was the Funds' use of financial leverage. While leverage
offers opportunities to generate additional income and total returns for common
shareholders, the benefits provided by leveraging are influenced by the price
movements of the bonds in each Fund's portfolio. During this period, as yields
on longer-term bonds rose and their prices correspondingly fell, declining
valuations had a negative effect on performance that was magnified by the use of
leverage. In addition, at various points during the twelve-month period, the
Funds' borrowing costs were relatively high, negatively impacting their total
returns. In the turbulent market environment of the past twelve months, the
impact of any valuation change in the Fund's holdings - whether positive or
negative - was magnified by the use of leverage.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING BOND INSURANCE COMPANIES

As mentioned earlier, another factor that had an impact on the performance of
these Funds was their position in bonds backed by municipal bond insurers that
experienced downgrades in their credit ratings. During the period covered by
this report, AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, MBIA, RAAI and SYNCORA (formerly XLCA)
experienced one or more rating reductions by at least one or more rating
agencies. Subsequent to the reporting period, AMBAC, MBIA and SYNCORA
experienced further rating reductions while AGC and FSA received their first
rating reductions by at least one rating agency. At the time this report was
prepared, at least one rating agency has placed each of these insurers except
AGC on "negative outlook" or "negative credit watch," which may presage one or
more rating reductions for such insurer or insurers in the future. As concern
increased about the balance sheets of these insurers, prices on bonds insured by
these companies - especially those bonds with weaker underlying credits -
declined, detracting from the Funds' performance. By the end of this period,
most insured bonds were being valued according to their fundamentals as if they
were uninsured. On the whole, the holdings of all of our Funds continued to be
well diversified not only between insured and uninsured bonds, but also within
the insured bond category. It is important to note that municipal bonds
historically have had a very low rate of default.

RECENT CHANGES TO INVESTMENT POLICIES OF NUVEEN INSURED FUNDS

During March 2008, the Nuveen Fund Board approved changes to the investment
policies of all of the Nuveen insured municipal closed-end Funds. The new
policies require that (1) at least 80% of a Fund's net assets (including net
assets attributable to

auction rate preferred shares) must be invested in insured municipal bonds
guaranteed by insurers rated A or better by at least one rating agency at the
time of purchase; (2) at least 80% of a Fund's net assets (including net assets
attributable to auction rate preferred shares) must be invested in municipal
bonds rated AA or better by at least one rating agency (with or without
insurance), deemed to be of comparable quality by the Adviser, or backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. government or government agency
securities or U.S. Treasury-issued state and local government securities at the
time of purchase; and (3) up to 20% of a Fund's net assets (including net assets
attributable to auction rate preferred shares) may be invested in uninsured
municipal bonds rated below AA by at least one rating agency or deemed to be of
comparable quality by the Adviser at the time of purchase. These policy changes
are designed to increase portfolio manager flexibility and retain the insured
nature of the Funds' investment portfolios for current and future environments.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Beginning in October, the nation's financial institutions and financial
markets--including the municipal bond market--experienced significant turmoil.
Reductions in demand decreased valuations of municipal bonds across all credit
ratings, especially those with lower credit ratings, and this generally reduced
the Funds' net asset values. The municipal market is one in which dealer firms
make markets in bonds on a principal basis using their proprietary capital, and
during the recent market turmoil these firms' capital was severely constrained.
As a result, some firms were unwilling to commit their capital to purchase and
to serve as a dealer for municipal bonds. This reduction in dealer involvement
in the market was accompanied by significant net selling pressure by investors,
particularly with respect to lower-rated municipal bonds, as institutional
investors generally removed money from the municipal bond market, at least in
part because of their need to reduce the leveraging of their municipal
investments. This de-leveraging was in part driven by the overall reduction in
the amount of financing available for such leverage, the increased costs of such
leverage financing, and the need to reduce leverage levels that had recently
increased due to the decline in municipal bond prices.

Municipal bond prices were further negatively impacted by concerns that the need
for further de-leveraging and a supply overhang as a large amount of new issues
were postponed would cause selling pressure to persist for a period of time. In
addition to falling prices, these market conditions resulted in greater price
volatility of municipal bonds; wider credit spreads (i.e., lower quality bonds
fell in price more than higher quality bonds); significantly reduced liquidity
(i.e., the ability to sell bonds at a price close to their carrying value),
particularly for lower quality bonds; and a lack of price transparency (i.e.,
the ability to accurately determine the price at which a bond would likely
trade). Reduced liquidity was most pronounced in mid-October, and although
liquidity improved considerably over ensuing weeks, it may reoccur if financial
turmoil persists or worsens.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SECURITIES MARKETS

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the auction rate preferred shares issued by these Funds
than there were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear"
and that many or all auction rate preferred shareholders who wanted to sell
their shares in these auctions were unable to do so. This decline in liquidity
in auction rate preferred shares did not lower the credit quality of these
shares, and auction rate preferred shareholders unable to sell their shares
received distributions at the "maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions as
calculated in accordance with the pre-established terms of the auction rate
preferred shares.

On June 11, 2008, Nuveen announced the Fund Board's approval of plans to use
tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as floating rate securities, to refinance
a portion of the municipal Funds' outstanding auction rate preferred shares, for
which auctions have been failing for several months. This plan included an
initial phase of approximately $1 billion in forty-one Funds. During the
twelve-month reporting period, NQI, NIO, NIF, NVG and NEA redeemed $19,575,000,
$56,650,000, $6,050,000, $6,025,000 and $11,200,000 of their outstanding auction
rate preferred shares, respectively, at liquidation value, using the proceeds
from the issuance of TOBs.

On August 7, 2008, NPX issued par redemption notices for all outstanding shares
of its auction rate preferred securities totaling $268.9 million. These
redemptions were achieved through the issuance of $219 million of variable rate
demand preferred shares (VRDP) and the proceeds from the creation of TOBs. VRDP
is a new instrument designed to replace the auction rate preferred securities
used as leverage in many Nuveen closed-end funds. VRDP is offered only to
qualified institutional buyers, as defined pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the twelve-month period ended October 31, 2008, there was one dividend
increase in NQI, NIO, NIF and NVG, while the dividends of NPX and NEA remained
stable throughout the reporting period.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of NIO received a long-term capital gains distribution of $0.0019 per share at
the end of December 2007.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2008, NQI,
NIO, NIF, NPX and NVG had positive UNII balances for tax purposes and negative
UNII balances for financial statement purposes. NEA had a zero UNII balance for
tax purposes and a negative UNII balance for financial statement purposes.

The Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved an open-market share repurchase
program on July 30, 2008, under which each Fund may repurchase up to 10% of its
common shares. As of October 31, 2008, the Funds had not repurchased any of
their outstanding common shares.

As of October 31, 2008, the Funds' common share prices were trading at discounts

(1)   The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
      certain bonds insured by AGC, AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, FSA, MBIA, RAAI and
      SYNCORA as of October 31, 2008. Please see the Portfolio Manager's
      Commentary for an expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes
      to the ratings of certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to
      the ratings of the underlying insurers both during the period and after
      period end.

(2)   At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities
      that are covered by insurance or backed by an escrow or trust account
      containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities
      or U.S. Treasury-issued State and Local Government Series securities to
      ensure the timely payment of principal and interest. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(3)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

Report of

  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
   PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors/Trustees and Shareholders
Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.
Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc.
Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.
Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund
Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2,
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund, and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free
Advantage Municipal Fund (the "Funds") as of October 31, 2008, and the related
statements of operations and cash flows (Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal
Fund 2 only) for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Municipal
Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2, Nuveen Insured Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund, and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund
at October 31, 2008, the results of their operations and cash flows (Nuveen
Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2 only) for the year then ended,
changes in their net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

</TABLE>

        At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
        to Auction Rate Preferred  shares) are invested in municipal  securities
        that are covered by  insurance  or backed by an escrow or trust  account
        containing   sufficient  U.S.   Government  or  U.S.  Government  agency
        securities or U.S.  Treasury-issued  State and Local  Government  Series
        securities to ensure the timely  payment of principal and interest.  See
        Notes  to  Financial  Statements,   Footnote  1 - Insurance,   for  more
        information.

  (1)   All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
        assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2)   Optional  Call  Provisions  (not  covered by the  report of  independent
        registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
        the  earliest  optional  call or  redemption.  There  may be other  call
        provisions  at varying  prices at later dates.  Certain  mortgage-backed
        securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3)   Ratings  (not  covered by the report of  independent  registered  public
        accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard
        & Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
        below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are  considered  to be
        below investment grade.

        The  Portfolio of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
        insured by AGC,  AMBAC,  CIFG,  FGIC,  FSA, MBIA, RAAI and SYNCORA as of
        October 31, 2008. Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary for an
        expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings
        of certain bonds in the portfolio  resulting from changes to the ratings
        of the underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

  (4)   Backed by an escrow or trust  containing  sufficient U.S.  Government or
        U.S.  Government  agency  securities  which ensure the timely payment of
        principal and interest.  Such investments are normally  considered to be
        equivalent to AAA rated securities.

  (5)   Investment  has a maturity of more than one year,  but has variable rate
        and demand  features  which qualify it as a short-term  investment.  The
        rate  disclosed  is that in effect at the end of the  reporting  period.
        This rate changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified
        market index.

  (6)   Auction Rate Preferred  Shares,  at Liquidation Value as a percentage of
        Total Investments is 38.5%.

  N/R   Not rated.

(ETM)   Escrowed to maturity.

 (IF)   Inverse floating rate investment.

 (UB)   Underlying  bond  of an  inverse  floating  rate  trust  reflected  as a
        financing transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
      to Auction Rate  Preferred  shares) are  invested in municipal  securities
      that are  covered  by  insurance  or backed by an escrow or trust  account
      containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities
      or U.S.  Treasury-issued  State and Local Government  Series securities to
      ensure  the  timely  payment  of  principal  and  interest.  See  Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

  (1) All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of  Investments  are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2) Optional  Call  Provisions  (not  covered  by the  report  of  independent
      registered public  accounting firm):  Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the  earliest  optional  call  or  redemption.  There  may be  other  call
      provisions  at  varying  prices at later  dates.  Certain  mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3) Ratings  (not  covered  by the  report of  independent  registered  public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's")  rating.  Ratings
      below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by  Moody's  are  considered  to be
      below  investment  grade.

      The  Portfolio  of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain  bonds
      insured by AGC,  AMBAC,  CIFG,  FGIC,  FSA,  MBIA,  RAAI and SYNCORA as of
      October 31, 2008.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
      expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
      certain  bonds in the portfolio  resulting  from changes to the ratings of
      the underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

  (4) Portion of investment has been pledged as collateral for Recourse Trusts.

  (5) Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government  agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

  (6) Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand  features  which  qualify it as a short-term  investment.  The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period.  This rate
      changes  periodically  based on market  conditions  or a specified  market
      index.

  (7) Auction Rate Preferred  Shares,  at  Liquidation  Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 37.0%.

  N/R Not rated.

WI/DD Purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

 (IF) Inverse floating rate investment.

 (UB) Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

</TABLE>

        At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
        to Auction Rate Preferred  shares) are invested in municipal  securities
        that are covered by  insurance  or backed by an escrow or trust  account
        containing   sufficient  U.S.   Government  or  U.S.  Government  agency
        securities or U.S.  Treasury-issued  State and Local  Government  Series
        securities to ensure the timely  payment of principal and interest.  See
        Notes  to  Financial  Statements,   Footnote  1 - Insurance,   for  more
        information.

  (1)   All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
        assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2)   Optional  Call  Provisions  (not  covered by the  report of  independent
        registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
        the  earliest  optional  call or  redemption.  There  may be other  call
        provisions  at varying  prices at later dates.  Certain  mortgage-backed
        securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3)   Ratings  (not  covered by the report of  independent  registered  public
        accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard
        & Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
        below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are  considered  to be

            At  least  80%  of the  Fund's  net  assets  (including  net  assets
            attributable to Variable Rate Demand Preferred  shares) are invested
            in municipal  securities  that are covered by insurance or backed by
            an escrow or trust account containing  sufficient U.S. Government or
            U.S. Government agency securities or U.S.  Treasury-issued State and
            Local Government  Series  securities to ensure the timely payment of
            principal and interest. See Notes to Financial Statements,  Footnote
            1 - Insurance, for more information.

      (1)   All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on
            net assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

      (2)   Optional Call  Provisions  (not covered by the report of independent
            registered  public  accounting  firm):  Dates  (month  and year) and
            prices of the earliest  optional  call or  redemption.  There may be
            other call  provisions  at varying  prices at later  dates.  Certain
            mortgage-backed  securities  may be  subject to  periodic  principal
            paydowns.

      (3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent  registered public
            accounting  firm):  Using the  higher  of  Standard  & Poor's  Group
            ("Standard & Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc. ("Moody's")
            rating. Ratings below BBB by Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are
            considered to be below investment grade.

            The  Portfolio  of  Investments  may  reflect the ratings on certain
            bonds insured by AGC, AMBAC, CIFG, FGIC, FSA, MBIA, RAAI and SYNCORA
            as  of  October  31,  2008.  Please  see  the  Portfolio   Manager's
            Commentary  for an expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of
            changes to the ratings of certain bonds in the  portfolio  resulting
            from changes to the ratings of the  underlying  insurers both during
            the period and after period end.

      (4)   Portion of investment  has been pledged as  collateral  for Recourse
            Trusts.

      (5)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing  sufficient U.S.  Government
            or U.S. Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment
            of principal and interest.  Such investments are normally considered
            to be equivalent to AAA rated securities.

      (6)   Investment  has a maturity of more than one year,  but has  variable
            rate  and  demand   features   which  qualify  it  as  a  short-term
            investment.  The rate  disclosed is that in effect at the end of the
            reporting  period.  This rate changes  periodically  based on market
            conditions or a specified market index.

      (7)   Variable Rate Demand Preferred  Shares,  at Liquidation  Value, as a
            percentage of Total Investments is 30.9%.

      N/R   Not rated.

    (ETM)   Escrowed to maturity.

     (IF)   Inverse floating rate investment.

     (UB)   Underlying  bond of an inverse  floating  rate trust  reflected as a
            financing transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

USD-LIBOR (United States Dollar-London Inter-Bank Offered Rate).

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
      to Auction Rate  Preferred  shares) are  invested in municipal  securities
      that are  covered  by  insurance  or backed by an escrow or trust  account
      containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities
      or U.S.  Treasury-issued  State and Local Government  Series securities to
      ensure  the  timely  payment  of  principal  and  interest.  See  Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

 (1)  All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of  Investments  are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

 (2)  Optional  Call  Provisions  (not  covered  by the  report  of  independent
      registered public  accounting firm):  Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the  earliest  optional  call  or  redemption.  There  may be  other  call
      provisions  at  varying  prices at later  dates.  Certain  mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

 (3)  Ratings  (not  covered  by the  report of  independent  registered  public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's")  rating.  Ratings
      below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by  Moody's  are  considered  to be
      below  investment  grade.

      The  Portfolio  of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain  bonds
      insured by AGC,  AMBAC,  CIFG,  FGIC,  FSA,  MBIA,  RAAI and SYNCORA as of
      October 31, 2008.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
      expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
      certain  bonds in the portfolio  resulting  from changes to the ratings of
      the underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

 (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government  agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

 (5)  Portion of investment has been pledged as collateral for Recourse Trusts.

 (6)  Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand  features  which  qualify it as a short-term  investment.  The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period.  This rate
      changes  periodically  based on market  conditions  or a specified  market
      index.

 (7)  Auction Rate Preferred  Shares,  at  Liquidation  Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 37.0%.

 (8)  Effective Date represents the date on which both the Fund and counterparty
      commence interest payment accruals on each forward swap contract.

 N/R  Not rated.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction  pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

</TABLE>

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
      to Auction Rate  Preferred  shares) are  invested in municipal  securities
      that are  covered  by  insurance  or backed by an escrow or trust  account
      containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities
      or U.S.  Treasury-issued  State and Local Government  Series securities to
      ensure  the  timely  payment  of  principal  and  interest.  See  Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

  (1) All  percentages  shown in the Portfolio of  Investments  are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2) Optional  Call  Provisions  (not  covered  by the  report  of  independent
      registered public  accounting firm):  Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the  earliest  optional  call  or  redemption.  There  may be  other  call
      provisions  at  varying  prices at later  dates.  Certain  mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3) Ratings  (not  covered  by the  report of  independent  registered  public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's")  rating.  Ratings
      below BBB by  Standard & Poor's or Baa by  Moody's  are  considered  to be
      below investment grade.

      The  Portfolio  of  Investments  may reflect the ratings on certain  bonds
      insured by AGC,  AMBAC,  CIFG,  FGIC,  FSA,  MBIA,  RAAI and SYNCORA as of
      October 31, 2008.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
      expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
      certain  bonds in the portfolio  resulting  from changes to the ratings of
      the underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

  (4) Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government  agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

  (5) Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand  features  which  qualify it as a short-term  investment.  The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period.  This rate
      changes  periodically  based on market  conditions  or a specified  market
      index.

  (6) Auction Rate Preferred  Shares,  at  Liquidation  Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 36.5%.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

 (IF) Inverse floating rate investment.

 (UB) Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

1. General Information and Significant Accounting Policies

The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc. (NQI), Nuveen
Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal
Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2 (NPX),
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG) and Nuveen Insured
Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA) (collectively, the "Funds"). Common
shares of Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured
Income (NIF) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured
Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds
are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as
closed-end, diversified management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service may establish fair value based on
yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for an investment or derivative
instrument, each Fund may use market quotes provided by major broker/dealers in
such investments. If it is determined that the market price for an investment or
derivative instrument is unavailable or inappropriate, the Board of
Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish fair value in
accordance with procedures established in good faith by the Board of
Directors/Trustees. Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate
and demand features qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates value.

Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2008, Insured
Opportunity (NIO) had outstanding when issued/delayed delivery purchase
commitments of $5,214,363. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments
in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any. Dividend
income, if any, is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

                                                                           -----
                                                                            83
                                                                           -----

Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal and applicable state
income taxes, if any, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the
alternative minimum tax applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt
status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. Net realized capital gains
and ordinary income distributions paid by the Funds are subject to federal
taxation.

Effective April 30, 2008, the Funds adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN
48). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the affirmative evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in the course of preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether it
is "more-likely-than-not" (i.e., a greater than 50-percent likelihood) of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold may result in a tax expense in the current year.

Implementation of FIN 48 required management of the Funds to analyze all open
tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major
jurisdictions, which includes federal and certain states. Open tax years are
those that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the
last four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). The Funds have
no examinations in progress.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions through the end of the
reporting period, management of the Funds has reviewed all tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in the preparation of the Funds' tax returns and
concluded the adoption of FIN 48 resulted in no impact to the Funds' net assets
or results of operations as of and during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2008.

The Funds are also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably
possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
change in the next twelve months.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Auction Rate Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares, $25,000
stated value per share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's
Auction Rate Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate paid by the Funds on each Series is determined every seven days, pursuant
to a dutch auction process overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the
end of each rate period. As of October 31, 2008, the number of Auction Rate
Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each Fund is as
follows:

================================================================================

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the Auction Rate Preferred shares issued by the Funds
than there were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear,"
and that many Auction Rate Preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their
shares in these auctions were unable to do so. Auction Rate Preferred
shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the "maximum
rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with the
pre-established terms of the Auction Rate Preferred shares.

These developments generally do not affect the management or investment policies
of the Funds. However, one implication of these auction failures for Common
shareholders is that the Funds' cost of leverage will likely be higher, at least
temporarily, than it otherwise would have been had the auctions continued to be
successful. As a result, the Funds' future Common share earnings may be lower
than they otherwise would have been.

On June 11, 2008, Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen") announced the Fund Board's
approval of plans to use tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as "floaters" or
floating rate obligations, to refinance a portion of the municipal funds'
outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares, whose auctions have been failing for
several months. The plan included an initial phase of approximately $1 billion
in forty-one funds. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, Insured
Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF), Insured
Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) redeemed
$19,575,000, $56,650,000, $6,050,000, $6,025,000 and $11,200,000 of their
outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares, respectively, at liquidation value,
using the proceeds from the issuance of TOBs.

Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares

On August 7, 2008, Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) issued 2,190 Series 1 Variable
Rate Demand Preferred (VRDP) shares, $100,000 liquidation value per share,
through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Proceeds of this offering along with the
proceeds from the Fund's creation of TOBs, discussed above, were used to redeem
all of the Fund's outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares totaling
$268,900,000. The VRDP shares have a maturity date of August 1, 2038. Dividends
on the VRDP shares are set through a weekly remarketing process at a rate
established by a remarketing agent, which is intended to result in the value of
the VRDP shares approximately equaling their liquidation value. VRDP shares
include a liquidity feature that allows VRDP shareholders who are tendering
shares for remarketing to have their shares purchased by a liquidity provider,
Deutsche Bank AG (acting through its New York branch), in the event that the
remarketing agent is not able to sell the tendered VRDP shares to other
qualified institutional buyers.

Subject to certain conditions, VRDP shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part,
at any time at the option of the Fund. The Fund may also redeem certain of the
VRDP shares if the Fund fails to maintain certain asset coverage requirements
and such failures are not cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption
price per share is equal to the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any
accumulated but unpaid dividends.

                                                                           -----
                                                                            85
                                                                           -----

| Notes to
| FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The terms of the VRDP shares provide that, if any VRDP shares tendered to the
liquidity provider cannot be successfully remarketed, the dividend rate for all
VRDP shares will be set at the Maximum Rate determined under a formula set forth
in the Fund's organizational documents. The Maximum Rate is generally equal to a
stated percentage spread in excess of the seven-day London Inter-Bank Offered
Rate (LIBOR). If remarketings for these shares continue to be unsuccessful, the
Maximum Rate is designed to escalate according to a specified schedule in order
to enhance the remarketing agent's ability to successfully remarket the VRDP
shares. This would increase the Fund's cost of leverage over time and reduce the
Fund's Common share net earnings. There are various potential factors that could
result in unsuccessful remarketings. These include periods of market stress, an
actual or potential downgrade of the liquidity provider's credit ratings as well
as changes in market perceptions regarding the financial strength of the Fund's
liquidity provider.

Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) had $219,000,000 VRDP shares outstanding for the
period August 7, 2008 through October 31, 2008 with an average annualized
dividend (interest) rate of 3.56%.

For financial reporting purposes only, VRDP shares, at their liquidation value,
are recorded as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and the
dividends paid on the VRDP shares are included as a component of "Interest
expense" on the Statement of Operations.

Insurance

Under normal circumstances, each Fund will invest at least 80% of their net
assets (including net assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or
VRDP shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing
the timely payment of principal and interest. For purposes of this 80% test,
insurers must have a claims paying ability rated at least "A" at the time of
purchase by at least one independent rating agency. In addition, each Fund will
invest at least 80% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to
Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares) in municipal securities that are
rated at least "AA" at the time of purchase (based on the higher of the rating
of the insurer, if any, or the underlying security) by at least one independent
rating agency, or are unrated but judged to be of similar credit quality by
Nuveen Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuveen, or
municipal bonds backed by an escrow or trust account containing sufficient U.S.
government or U.S. government agency securities or U.S. Treasury-issued State
and Local Government Series securities to ensure timely payment of principal and
interest. Each Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net
assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares) in
municipal securities rated below "AA" (based on the higher rating of the
insurer, if any, or the underlying bond) or are unrated but judged to be of
comparable quality by the Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Inverse Floating Rate Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying
bond but also on the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates,
and because the inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of
loss of the greater face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the
Fund the right (a) to cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to
tender their notes at par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate
bond held by the trust to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment
in an externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as an "Inverse floating rate investment". An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater is accounted for as a financing transaction in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (SFAS No.
140) "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities". In such instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited
into a special purpose trust is identified in the Portfolio of Investments as an
"Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust", with the Fund accounting
for the short-term floating rate certificates issued by the trust as "Floating
rate obligations" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the
Fund reflects in Investment Income the entire earnings of the underlying bond
and the related interest paid to the holders of the short-term floating rate
certificates is included as a component of "Interest expense" on the Statement
of Operations.

Each Fund may also enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements (sometimes
referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit recovery swap") (such agreements
referred to herein as "Recourse Trusts") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund
agrees to reimburse the broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the
trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate certificates issued by the
trust plus any shortfalls in interest cash flows. Under these agreements, a
Fund's potential exposure to losses related to or on inverse floaters may
increase beyond the value of a Fund's inverse floater investments as a Fund may
potentially be liable to fulfill all amounts owed to holders of the floating
rate certificates. At period end, any such shortfall is included as "Unrealized
depreciation on Recourse Trusts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, each Fund invested in externally
deposited inverse floaters and/or sell deposited inverse floaters.

Forward Swap Transactions

Each Fund is authorized to invest in forward interest rate swap transactions.
Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve
each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or
variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve
the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather
is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to
terminate its forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to
the credit risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment
to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon termination. To reduce such credit
risk, all counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the
daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold.
Reciprocally, when any of the Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract,
the Funds have instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as
collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss
above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate, either up or
down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount. Insured Premium Income 2
(NPX) and Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) were the only Funds to invest in
forward interest rate swap transactions during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2008.

Zero Coupon Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the Portfolios of Investments
with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description. The market prices of zero coupon
securities generally are more volatile than the market prices of securities that
pay interest periodically.

Offering Costs

Costs incurred by Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) in connection with its offering
of the VRDP shares ($2,535,000) were recorded as a deferred charge which will be
amortized over the 30-year life of the shares and is included as a component of
"Interest expense" on the Statement of Operations.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

2. Fund Shares

Common Shares

On July 30, 2008, the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved an open-market
share repurchase program under which each Fund may repurchase an aggregate of up
to approximately 10% of its outstanding Common shares. The Funds did not
repurchase any of their Common shares during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2008.

Transactions in Common shares were as follows:

4. Income Tax Information

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
transactions subject to SFAS No. 140. To the extent that differences arise that
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented in the annual
report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not
require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the
net asset values of the Funds.

At October 31, 2008, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. Management Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the
Adviser, and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets
within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund
shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as
well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Auction Rate
Preferred shares or VRDP shares) of each Fund as follows:

(1)   The complex-level component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate daily net assets of all Nuveen funds,
      with such daily net assets to include assets attributable to preferred
      stock (Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares) issued by or
      borrowings by such funds but to exclude assets attributable to investments
      in other Nuveen funds.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or
VRDP shares), for fees and expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set
forth below:

6. New Accounting Pronouncements

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 (SFAS No. 157)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This
standard establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a
framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already
required or permitted by existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The changes to current generally
accepted accounting principles from the application of this standard relate to
the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the
expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. As of October 31, 2008,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional disclosures may be required
about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of
the measurements included within the Statement of Operations for the period.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 161 (SFAS No. 161)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard is intended to enhance
financial statement disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and enable investors to understand: a) how and why a fund uses
derivative instruments, b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
are accounted for, and c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
affect a fund's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS
No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. As of October 31, 2008,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional footnote disclosures may be
required about the use of derivative instruments and hedging items.

*     Rounds to less than $.01 per share.

**    Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

***   After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

****  During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and
      Insured Opportunity (NIO) received payments from the Adviser of $27,762
      and $42,338, respectively, to offset losses realized on the disposal of
      investments purchased in violation of each Fund's investment restrictions.
      This reimbursement did not have an impact on the Funds' Total Return on
      Common Share Net Asset Value.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
      attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares, where
      applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
      shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
      floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares and
      Inverse Floating Rate Securities, where applicable.

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
      attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares, where
      applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
      shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
      floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares and
      Inverse Floating Rate Securities, where applicable.

      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
      attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares, where
      applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
      shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
      floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares and
      Inverse Floating Rate Securities, where applicable.

Annual Investment
Management Agreement

                                                                Approval PROCESS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), provides, in
substance, that each investment advisory agreement between a fund and its
investment adviser will continue in effect from year to year only if its
continuance is approved at least annually by the fund's board members, including
by a vote of a majority of the board members who are not parties to the advisory
agreement or "interested persons" of any parties (the "Independent Board
Members"), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of considering
such approval. In connection with such approvals, the fund's board members must
request and evaluate, and the investment adviser is required to furnish, such
information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the advisory
agreement. Accordingly, at a meeting held on May 28-29, 2008 (the "May
Meeting"), the Boards of Trustees or Directors (as the case may be)(each, a
"Board" and each Trustee or Director, a "Board Member") of the Funds, including
a majority of the Independent Board Members, considered and approved the
continuation of the advisory agreement (each, an "Advisory Agreement") between
each Fund and Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM") for an additional one-year period.
In preparation for their considerations at the May Meeting, the Board also held
a separate meeting on April 23, 2008 (the "April Meeting"). Accordingly, the
factors considered and determinations made regarding the renewals by the
Independent Board Members include those made at the April Meeting.

In addition, in evaluating the Advisory Agreements, as described in further
detail below, the Independent Board Members reviewed a broad range of
information relating to the Funds and NAM, including absolute performance, fee
and expense information for the Funds as well as comparative performance, fee
and expense information for a comparable peer group of funds, the performance
information of recognized benchmarks (as applicable), the profitability of
Nuveen for its advisory activities (which includes its wholly owned
subsidiaries), and other information regarding the organization, personnel, and
services provided by NAM. The Independent Board Members also met quarterly as
well as at other times as the need arose during the year and took into account
the information provided at such meetings and the knowledge gained therefrom.
Prior to approving the renewal of the Advisory Agreements, the Independent Board
Members reviewed the foregoing information with their independent legal counsel
and with management, reviewed materials from independent legal counsel
describing applicable law and their duties in reviewing advisory contracts, and
met with independent legal counsel in private sessions without management
present. The Independent Board Members considered the legal advice provided by
independent legal counsel and relied upon their knowledge of NAM, its services
and the Funds resulting from their meetings and other interactions throughout
the year and their own business judgment in determining the factors to be
considered in evaluating the Advisory Agreements. Each Board Member may have
accorded different weight to the various factors in reaching his or her
conclusions with respect to a Fund's Advisory Agreement. The Independent Board
Members did not identify any single factor as all-important or controlling. The
Independent Board Members' considerations were instead based on a comprehensive
consideration of all the information presented. The principal factors considered
by the Board and its conclusions are described below.

A.    Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

In considering renewal of the Advisory Agreements, the Independent Board Members
considered the nature, extent and quality of NAM's services, including advisory
services and administrative services. The Independent Board Members reviewed
materials outlining, among other things, NAM's organization and business; the
types of services that NAM or its affiliates provide and are expected to provide
to the Funds; the performance record of the applicable Fund (as described in
further detail below); and any initiatives Nuveen had taken for the applicable
fund product line. With respect to personnel, the Independent Board Members
evaluated the background, experience and track record of NAM's

- ------

<PAGE>

investment personnel. In this regard, the Independent Board Members considered
the additional investment in personnel to support Nuveen fund advisory
activities, including in operations, product management and marketing as well as
related fund support functions, including sales, executive, finance, human
resources and information technology. The Independent Board Members also
reviewed information regarding portfolio manager compensation arrangements to
evaluate NAM's ability to attract and retain high quality investment personnel.

In evaluating the services of NAM, the Independent Board Members also considered
NAM's ability to supervise the Funds' other service providers and given the
importance of compliance, NAM's compliance program. Among other things, the
Independent Board Members considered the report of the chief compliance officer
regarding the Funds' compliance policies and procedures.

In addition to advisory services, the Independent Board Members considered the
quality of administrative services provided by NAM and its affiliates including
product management, fund administration, oversight of service providers,
shareholder services, administration of Board relations, regulatory and
portfolio compliance and legal support.

In addition to the foregoing services, the Independent Board Members also noted
the additional services that NAM or its affiliates provide to closed-end funds,
including, in particular, its secondary market support activities and the costs
of such activities. The Independent Board Members recognized Nuveen's continued
commitment to supporting the secondary market for the common shares of its
closed-end funds through a variety of programs designed to raise investor and
analyst awareness and understanding of closed-end funds. These efforts include
maintaining an investor relations program to timely provide information and
education to financial advisers and investors; providing advertising and
marketing for the closed-end funds; maintaining its closed-end fund website; and
providing educational seminars. With respect to closed-end funds that utilize
leverage through the issuance of auction rate preferred securities ("ARPS"), the
Board has recognized the unprecedented market conditions in the auction rate
market industry with the failure of the auction process. The Independent Board
Members noted Nuveen's efforts and the resources and personnel employed to
analyze the situation, explore potential alternatives and develop and implement
solutions that serve the interests of the affected funds and all of their
respective shareholders. The Independent Board Members further noted Nuveen's
commitment and efforts to keep investors and financial advisers informed as to
its progress in addressing the ARPS situation through, among other things,
conference calls, press releases, and information posted on its website as well
as its refinancing activities. The Independent Board Members also noted Nuveen's
continued support for holders of preferred shares of its closed-end funds by,
among other things, seeking distribution for preferred shares with new market
participants, managing relations with remarketing agents and the broker
community, maintaining the leverage and risk management of leverage and
maintaining systems necessary to test compliance with rating agency criteria.

Based on their review, the Independent Board Members found that, overall, the
nature, extent and quality of services provided (and expected to be provided) to
the respective Funds under the Advisory Agreements were satisfactory.

B.    The Investment Performance of the Funds and NAM

The Board considered the investment performance of each Fund, including the
Fund's historic performance as well as its performance compared to funds with
similar investment objectives (the "Performance Peer Group") based on data
provided by an independent third party (as described below). The Independent
Board Members also reviewed portfolio level performance (which does not reflect
fund level fees, expenses and leverage), as described in further detail below.

In evaluating the performance information, the Board considered whether the Fund
has operated within its investment objectives and parameters and the impact that
the investment mandates may have had on performance. In addition, in comparing a
Fund's performance with that of its Performance Peer Group, the Independent
Board Members took into account that the closest Performance Peer Group in
certain

                                                                          ------
                                                                           107
                                                                          ------

<PAGE>

| Annual Investment Management Agreement
| Approval Process (continued)

instances may not adequately reflect the respective fund's investment objectives
and strategies thereby hindering a meaningful comparison of the fund's
performance with that of the Performance Peer Group.

The Independent Board Members reviewed performance information including, among
other things, total return information compared with the Fund's Performance Peer
Group and recognized benchmarks for the one-, three-, and five-year periods (as
applicable) ending December 31, 2007 and with the Performance Peer Group for the
quarter and same yearly periods ending March 31, 2008 (as applicable). The
Independent Board Members also reviewed the Fund's portfolio level performance
(which does not reflect fund level fees and expenses (and leverage for
closed-end funds)) compared to recognized benchmarks for the one-, three-, and
five-year periods ending December 31, 2007 (as applicable). The analysis was
used to assess the efficacy of investment decisions against appropriate measures
of risk and total return, within specific market segments. This information
supplemented the Fund performance information provided to the Board at each of
its quarterly meetings. Based on their review, the Independent Board Members
determined that each Fund's investment performance over time had been
satisfactory.

C.    Fees, Expenses and Profitability

      1. Fees and Expenses

      The Board evaluated the management fees and expenses of each Fund
      reviewing, among other things, such Fund's gross management fees (which
      take into account breakpoints), net management fees (which take into
      account fee waivers or reimbursements) and total expense ratios (before
      and after expense reimbursements and/or waivers) in absolute terms as well
      as compared to the gross management fees, net management fees (after
      waivers and/or reimbursements) and total expense ratios (before and after
      waivers) of a comparable universe of unaffiliated funds based on data
      provided by an independent data provider (the "Peer Universe") and/or a
      more focused subset of funds therein (the "Peer Group"). The Independent
      Board Members further reviewed data regarding the construction of Peer
      Groups as well as the methods of measurement for the fee and expense
      analysis and the performance analysis. In reviewing the comparisons of fee
      and expense information, the Independent Board Members took into account
      that in certain instances various factors such as the size of the Fund
      relative to peers, the size and particular composition of the Peer Group,
      the investment objectives of the peers, expense anomalies, and the timing
      of information used may impact the comparative data, thereby limiting the
      ability to make a meaningful comparison. The Independent Board Members
      also considered, among other things, the differences in the use of
      leverage and the differences in the use of insurance, if any. In reviewing
      the fee schedule for a Fund, the Independent Board Members also considered
      the fund-level and complex-wide breakpoint schedules (described in further
      detail below) and any fee waivers and reimbursements provided by Nuveen
      (applicable, in particular, for certain closed-end funds launched since
      1999). Based on their review of the fee and expense information provided,
      the Independent Board Members determined that each Fund's management fees
      and net total expense ratio were reasonable in light of the nature, extent
      and quality of services provided to the Fund.

      2. Comparisons with the Fees of Other Clients

      The Independent Board Members further reviewed information regarding the
      nature of services and fee rates offered by NAM to other clients. Such
      other clients include NAM's municipal separately managed accounts. In
      evaluating the comparisons of fees, the Independent Board Members noted
      that the fee rates charged to the Funds and other clients vary, among
      other things, because of the different services involved and the
      additional regulatory and compliance requirements associated with
      registered investment companies, such as the Funds. Accordingly, the
      Independent Board Members considered the differences in the product types,
      including, but not limited to, the services provided, the structure and
      operations, product distribution and costs thereof, portfolio investment
      policies, investor profiles, account sizes and regulatory requirements.
      The Independent Board Members noted, in particular, that

- ------
  108
- ------

<PAGE>

      the range of services provided to the Funds (as discussed above) is much
      more extensive than that provided to separately managed accounts. Given
      the inherent differences in the products, particularly the extensive
      services provided to the Funds, the Independent Board Members believe such
      facts justify the different levels of fees.

      3. Profitability of Nuveen

      In conjunction with its review of fees, the Independent Board Members also
      considered the profitability of Nuveen for its advisory activities (which
      incorporated Nuveen's wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisers) and its
      financial condition. The Independent Board Members reviewed the revenues
      and expenses of Nuveen's advisory activities for the last two years and
      the allocation methodology used in preparing the profitability data. The
      Independent Board Members noted this information supplemented the
      profitability information requested and received during the year to help
      keep them apprised of developments affecting profitability (such as
      changes in fee waivers and expense reimbursement commitments). In this
      regard, the Independent Board Members noted that they had also appointed
      an Independent Board Member as a point person to review and keep them
      apprised of changes to the profitability analysis and/or methodologies
      during the year. The Independent Board Members considered Nuveen's
      profitability compared with other fund sponsors prepared by two
      independent third party service providers as well as comparisons of the
      revenues, expenses and profit margins of various unaffiliated management
      firms with similar amounts of assets under management prepared by Nuveen.

      In reviewing profitability, the Independent Board Members recognized the
      subjective nature of determining profitability which may be affected by
      numerous factors including the allocation of expenses. Further, the
      Independent Board Members recognized the difficulties in making
      comparisons as the profitability of other advisers generally is not
      publicly available and the profitability information that is available for
      certain advisers or management firms may not be representative of the
      industry and may be affected by, among other things, the adviser's
      particular business mix, capital costs, types of funds managed and expense
      allocations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Independent Board Members reviewed Nuveen's
methodology and assumptions for allocating expenses across product lines to
determine profitability. In reviewing profitability, the Independent Board
Members recognized Nuveen's investment in its fund business.

Based on its review, the Independent Board Members concluded that Nuveen's level
of profitability for its advisory activities was reasonable in light of the
services provided.

In evaluating the reasonableness of the compensation, the Independent Board
Members also considered other amounts paid to NAM by the Funds as well as any
indirect benefits (such as soft dollar arrangements, if any) NAM and its
affiliates receive, or are expected to receive, that are directly attributable
to the management of the Funds, if any. See Section E below for additional
information on indirect benefits NAM may receive as a result of its relationship
with the Funds. Based on their review of the overall fee arrangements of each
Fund, the Independent Board Members determined that the advisory fees and
expenses of the respective Fund were reasonable.

D.    Economies of Scale and Whether Fee Levels Reflect These Economies of Scale

With respect to economies of scale, the Independent Board Members recognized the
potential benefits resulting from the costs of a fund being spread over a larger
asset base. The Independent Board Members therefore considered whether the Funds
have appropriately benefited from any economies of scale and whether there is
potential realization of any further economies of scale. In considering
economies of scale, the Independent Board Members have recognized that economies
of scale are difficult to measure and predict with precision, particularly on a
fund-by-fund basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one method to help ensure the
shareholders share in these benefits is to include breakpoints in the advisory
fee schedule. Accordingly, the Independent Board Members reviewed and considered
the fund-level breakpoints in the

                                                                          ------
                                                                           109
                                                                          ------

<PAGE>

      | Annual Investment Management Agreement
      | Approval Process (continued)

      advisory fee schedules that reduce advisory fees. In this regard, given
      that the Funds are closed-end funds, the Independent Board Members
      recognized that although the Funds may from time to time make additional
      share offerings, the growth in their assets will occur primarily through
      appreciation of each Fund's investment portfolio.

      In addition to fund-level advisory fee breakpoints, the Board also
      considered the Funds' complex-wide fee arrangement. Pursuant to the
      complex-wide fee arrangement, the fees of the funds in the Nuveen complex,
      including the Funds, are reduced as the assets in the fund complex reach
      certain levels. In evaluating the complex-wide fee arrangement, the
      Independent Board Members recognized that the complex-wide fee schedule
      was recently revised in 2007 to provide for additional fee savings to
      shareholders and considered the amended schedule. The Independent Board
      Members further considered that the complex-wide fee arrangement seeks to
      provide the benefits of economies of scale to fund shareholders when total
      fund complex assets increase, even if assets of a particular fund are
      unchanged or have decreased. The approach reflects the notion that some of
      Nuveen's costs are attributable to services provided to all its funds in
      the complex and therefore all funds benefit if these costs are spread over
      a larger asset base. Based on their review, the Independent Board Members
      concluded that the breakpoint schedule and complex-wide fee arrangement
      were acceptable and desirable in providing benefits from economies of
      scale to shareholders.

      E. Indirect Benefits

      In evaluating fees, the Independent Board Members received and considered
      information regarding potential "fall out" or ancillary benefits NAM or
      its affiliates may receive as a result of its relationship with each Fund.
      In this regard, the Independent Board Members considered revenues received
      by affiliates of NAM for serving as agent at Nuveen's preferred trading
      desk and for serving as a co-manager in the initial public offering of new
      closed-end exchange traded funds.

      In addition to the above, the Independent Board Members considered whether
      NAM received any benefits from soft dollar arrangements whereby a portion
      of the commissions paid by a Fund for brokerage may be used to acquire
      research that may be useful to NAM in managing the assets of the Funds and
      other clients. The Independent Board Members noted that NAM does not
      currently have any soft dollar arrangements; however, to the extent
      certain bona fide agency transactions that occur on markets that
      traditionally trade on a principal basis and riskless principal
      transactions are considered as generating "commissions," NAM intends to
      comply with the applicable safe harbor provisions.

      Based on their review, the Independent Board Members concluded that any
      indirect benefits received by NAM as a result of its relationship with the
      Funds were reasonable and within acceptable parameters.

      F. Other Considerations

      The Independent Board Members did not identify any single factor discussed
      previously as all-important or controlling. The Board Members, including
      the Independent Board Members, unanimously concluded that the terms of the
      Advisory Agreements are fair and reasonable, that NAM's fees are
      reasonable in light of the services provided to each Fund and that the
      Advisory Agreements be renewed.

      Reinvest Automatically
         EASILY and CONVENIENTLY
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Nuveen makes reinvesting easy. A phone call is all it takes to set up your
      reinvestment account.

      Nuveen Closed-End Funds Dividend Reinvestment Plan

      Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends
      and/or capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

      By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
      automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of
      tax-free compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there
      may be times when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on
      dividends or distributions that are reinvested.

      It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not
      ensure a profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining
      market.

      Easy and convenient

      To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a
      statement showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of
      investment, the shares acquired and the price per share, and the total
      number of shares you own.

      How shares are purchased

      The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
      market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above
      net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares
      at the greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market
      price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for
      your account will be purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent
      begins purchasing Fund shares on the open market while shares are trading
      below net asset value, but the Fund's shares subsequently trade at or
      above their net asset value before the Plan Agent is able to complete its
      purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market purchases and may invest
      the uninvested portion of the distribution in newly-issued Fund shares at
      a price equal to the greater of the shares' net asset value or 95% of the
      shares' market value on the last business day immediately prior to the
      purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to purchase shares in
      the open market will normally be invested shortly after the dividend
      payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
      awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
      before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per share may
      exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
      acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
      paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
      brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
      participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged
      on individual transactions.

                                                                          ------

      Glossary of
      TERMS USED in this REPORT
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------

o     Auction Rate Bond: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
      payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
      process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
      Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
      sale are deemed to have "failed", with current holders receiving a
      formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

o     Average Annual Total Return: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     Average Effective Maturity: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     Inverse Floaters: Inverse floating rate securities are created by
      depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed interest rate, into a
      special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a)
      issues floating rate certificates typically paying short-term tax-exempt
      interest rates to third parties in amounts equal to some fraction of the
      deposited bond's par amount or market value, and (b) issues an inverse
      floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater")
      to an investor (such as a Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure
      to a long-term municipal bond. The income received by the holder of the
      inverse floater varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the
      floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the holder
      of the inverse floater bears substantially all of the underlying bond's
      downside investment risk. The holder of the inverse floater typically also
      benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
      underlying bond's value. Hence, an inverse floater essentially represents
      an investment in the underlying bond on a leveraged basis.

o     Leverage-Adjusted Duration: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     Market Yield (also known as Dividend Yield or Current Yield): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     Net Asset Value (NAV): A Fund's NAV per common share is calculated by
      subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any Preferred shares
      issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then
      dividing the remainder by the number of common shares outstanding. Fund
      NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

o     Taxable-Equivalent Yield: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     Zero Coupon Bond: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted a
code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions. There were no amendments to or waivers
from the Code during the period covered by this report. The registrant has

code, click on the Shareholder Resources drop down menu box, click on Fund
Governance and then click on Code of Conduct.)

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees determined that the registrant
has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 3 of
Form N-CSR) serving on its Audit Committee. The registrant's audit committee
financial expert is Jack B. Evans, who is "independent" for purposes of Item 3
of Form N-CSR.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser ("SCI"). As part of his role as President and Chief Operating Officer,
Mr. Evans actively supervised the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") and
actively supervised the CFO's preparation of financial statements and other

actively involved in the preparation of SCI's financial statements and the
resolution of issues raised in connection therewith. Mr. Evans has also served
on the audit committee of various reporting companies. At such companies, Mr.
Evans was involved in the oversight of audits, audit plans, and the preparation

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP the Audit Committee approved in advance all
audit services and non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the
Fund, except for those non-audit services that were subject to the pre-approval
exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The
pre-approval exception for services provided directly to the Fund waives the
pre-approval requirement for services other than audit, review or attest
services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes
no more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its
accountant during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (B) the
Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the
engagement; and (C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's
attention, and the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the
audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

     the audit of the Fund's annual financial statements and services provided
     in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.

(2)  "Audit Related Fees" are the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
     related services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or

     advice, tax compliance, and tax planning.

(4)  "All Other Fees" are the aggregate fees billed for products and services

                 SERVICES THAT THE FUND'S AUDITOR BILLED TO THE
                  ADVISER AND AFFILIATED FUND SERVICE PROVIDERS

The following tables show the amount of fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP to
Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM" or the "Adviser"), and any entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with NAM ("Control Affiliate") that
provides ongoing services to the Fund ("Affiliated Fund Service Provider"), for
engagements directly related to the Fund's operations and financial reporting,
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years.

The tables also show the percentage of fees subject to the pre-approval
exception. The pre-approval exception for services provided to the Adviser and
any Affiliated Fund Service Provider (other than audit, review or attest
services) waives the pre-approval requirement if: (A) the aggregate amount of
all such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid to Ernst & Young LLP by the Fund, the Adviser and Affiliated Fund
Service Providers during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that
would have to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee; (B) the Fund did not
recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; and
(C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and
the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the Fund's audit is
completed.

                               NON-AUDIT SERVICES

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. The Audit
Committee is required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP
provides to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the
engagement related directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting
(except for those subject to the de minimis exception described above). The
Audit Committee requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about
any non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last
fiscal year to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The
Committee considered this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP's
independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the Audit
Committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the Audit Committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the Audit Committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the Audit Committee at
the next Audit Committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees has a separately designated
Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The
members of the audit committee are Robert P. Bremner, Jack B. Evans, Terence J.
Toth, William J. Schneider and David J. Kundert.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

See Portfolio of Investments in Item 1.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant invests its assets primarily in municipal bonds and cash
management securities. On rare occasions the registrant may acquire, directly or
through a special purpose vehicle, equity securities of a municipal bond issuer
whose bonds the registrant already owns when such bonds have deteriorated or are
expected shortly to deteriorate significantly in credit quality. The purpose of
acquiring equity securities generally will be to acquire control of the
municipal bond issuer and to seek to prevent the credit deterioration or
facilitate the liquidation or other workout of the distressed issuer's credit
problem. In the course of exercising control of a distressed municipal issuer,
NAM may pursue the registrant's interests in a variety of ways, which may entail
negotiating and executing consents, agreements and other arrangements, and
otherwise influencing the management of the issuer. NAM does not consider such
activities proxy voting for purposes of Rule 206(4)-6 under the 1940 Act, but
nevertheless provides reports to the registrant's Board of Trustees on its
control activities on a quarterly basis.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer were to issue a proxy or that the
registrant were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security, NAM
would either engage an independent third party to determine how the proxy should
be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the instructions, of
the registrant's Board of Trustees or its representative. A member of NAM's
legal department would oversee the administration of the voting, and ensure that
records were maintained in accordance with Rule 206(4)-6, reports were filed
with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the results provided to the registrant's Board of
Trustees and made available to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER

The following individual has primary responsibility for the day-to-day
implementation of the registrant's investment strategies:

NAME                       FUND
PAUL BRENNAN               Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund

Other Accounts Managed. In addition to managing the registrant, the portfolio
manager is also primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of
the following accounts:

                                                       NUMBER OF
PORTFOLIO MANAGER   TYPE OF ACCOUNT MANAGED            ACCOUNTS   ASSETS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Brennan        Registered Investment Company      15         $12.36 billion
                    Other Pooled Investment Vehicles   0          $0
                    Other Accounts                     1          $.859 million

*    Assets are as of October 31, 2008. None of the assets in these accounts are
     subject to an advisory fee based on performance.

Compensation. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of three basic
elements--base salary, cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation. The
compensation strategy is to annually compare overall compensation, including
these three elements, to the market in order to create a compensation structure
that is competitive and consistent with similar financial services companies. As
discussed below, several factors are considered in determining each portfolio
manager's total compensation. In any year these factors may include, among
others, the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended by the
portfolio manager's investment team, the investment performance of the accounts
managed by the portfolio manager, and the overall performance of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. (the parent company of NAM). Although investment performance
is a factor in determining the portfolio manager's compensation, it is not
necessarily a decisive factor. The portfolio manager's performance is evaluated
in part by comparing manager's performance against a specified investment
benchmark. This fund-specific benchmark is a customized subset (limited to bonds
in each Fund's specific state and with certain maturity parameters) of the
S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index, an index comprised of bonds held by
managed municipal bond fund customers of Standard & Poor's Securities Pricing,
Inc. that are priced daily and whose fund holdings aggregate at least $2
million. As of October 31, 2008, the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index was
comprised of 52,959 securities with an aggregate current market value of $1,009
billion.

Base salary. Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary that is set at a level
determined by NAM in accordance with its overall compensation strategy discussed
above. NAM is not under any current contractual obligation to increase a
portfolio manager's base salary.

Cash bonus. Each portfolio manager is also eligible to receive an annual cash
bonus. The level of this bonus is based upon evaluations and determinations made
by each portfolio manager's supervisors, along with reviews submitted by his
peers. These reviews and evaluations often take into account a number of
factors, including the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended to
the NAM's investment team, the performance of the accounts for which he serves
as portfolio manager relative to any benchmarks established for those accounts,
his effectiveness in communicating investment performance to stockholders and
their representatives, and his contribution to the NAM's investment process and
to the execution of investment strategies. The cash bonus component is also
impacted by the overall performance of Nuveen Investments, Inc. in achieving its
business objectives.

Long-term incentive compensation. In connection with the acquisition of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., by a group of investors lead by Madison Dearborn Partners in
November 2007, certain employees, including portfolio managers, received profit
interests in Nuveen's parent. These profit interests entitle the holders to
participate in the appreciation in the value of Nuveen beyond the issue date and
vest over five to seven years, or earlier in the case of a liquidity event.

Material Conflicts of Interest. Each portfolio manager's simultaneous management
of the registrant and the other accounts noted above may present actual or
apparent conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation and aggregation of
securities orders placed on behalf of the Registrant and the other account. NAM,
however, believes that such potential conflicts are mitigated by the fact that
the NAM has adopted several policies that address potential conflicts of
interest, including best execution and trade allocation policies that are
designed to ensure (1) that portfolio management is seeking the best price for
portfolio securities under the circumstances, (2) fair and equitable allocation
of investment opportunities among accounts over time and (3) compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. All accounts are to be treated in a
non-preferential manner, such that allocations are not based upon account
performance, fee structure or preference of the portfolio manager, although the
allocation procedures may provide allocation preferences to funds with special
characteristics (such as favoring state funds versus national funds for
allocations of in-state bonds). In addition, NAM has adopted a Code of Conduct
that sets forth policies regarding conflicts of interest.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of October 31, 2008, the portfolio
manager beneficially owned the following dollar range of equity securities
issued by the Registrant and other Nuveen Funds managed by NAM's municipal
investment team.

     (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

     (d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second

          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
