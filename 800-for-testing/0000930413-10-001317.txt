             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members and Board of Managers of
   Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital of Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. (the "Company"), including
the schedules of portfolio investments, securities sold, not yet purchased and
swap contracts, as of December 31, 2009, and the related statement of operations
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in members' capital for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2009, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. at December 31, 2009, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its members' capital for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - DECEMBER 31, 2009

   1. ORGANIZATION

      Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized as a
      limited liability company under the laws of Delaware in January 1999. The
      Company is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
      (the "Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment
      company. The Company's term is perpetual unless the Company is otherwise
      terminated under the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement
      dated as of June 5, 2003. The Company's investment objective is to achieve
      maximum capital appreciation. It pursues this objective by actively
      investing in a portfolio consisting generally of equity securities of
      technology companies and of companies which derive a major portion of
      their revenue directly or indirectly from technological events and
      advances. The Company's portfolio of securities in the technology area is
      expected to include long and short positions primarily in equity
      securities of U.S. and non-U.S. companies. Equity securities include
      common and preferred stock and other securities having equity
      characteristics, including convertible debt securities, stock options,
      warrants and rights.

      Responsibility for the overall management and supervision of the
      operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
      Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of Managers"). There are six
      members of the Board of Managers, one of whom is considered an "interested
      person" under the Act. The Company's investment adviser is Advantage
      Advisers Management, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the
      "Adviser"). The Adviser is a subsidiary of Oppenheimer Asset Management
      Inc. ("OAM") and an affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. ("Oppenheimer").
      The Adviser is responsible for managing the Company's investment
      activities pursuant to an investment advisory agreement dated June 5,
      2003. OAM is the managing member of the Adviser, and Alkeon Capital
      Management L.L.C. ("Alkeon") is a non-managing member of the Adviser.
      Investment professionals employed by Alkeon, including Mr. Takis
      Sparaggis, who serves as the Company's portfolio manager, manage the
      Company's portfolio on behalf of the Adviser under the supervision of OAM.
      Oppenheimer has a minority profit participation interest in Alkeon.

      The acceptance of initial and additional contributions from Members is
      subject to approval by the Board of Managers. The Company may from time to
      time offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written tenders by Members.
      Such repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be
      determined by the Board of Managers, in its complete and exclusive
      discretion. The Adviser expects that generally it will recommend to the
      Board of Managers that the Company offer to repurchase interests from
      Members twice each year, effective at the end of the second fiscal quarter
      and again at the end of the year.

      Generally, except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not be
      liable for the Company's debts, obligations and liabilities in any amount
      in excess of the capital account balance of such Member, plus such
      Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting principles (hereafter referred to as "authoritative
      guidance") requires the Adviser to make estimates and assumptions that
      affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
      notes. The Adviser believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the
      Company's financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual
      results could differ from these estimates.

      In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued The
      FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally
      Accepted Principles. The standard identifies the FASB Accounting Standards
      Codification as the single source of authoritative U.S. accounting and
      reporting standards applicable for all non-governmental entities, with the
      exception of guidance issued by the SEC and its staff. It is effective for
      financial statements issued for interim and fiscal years ending on or
      after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted the standard effective
      December 31, 2009. The adoption did not have a material effect on the
      Company's financial statements.

      The following is a summary of the Company's accounting policies:

      a. REVENUE RECOGNITION

      Securities transactions, including related revenue and expenses, are
      recorded on a trade-date basis, and dividends are recorded on the
      ex-dividend date, net of applicable withholding taxes. Interest income and
      expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on fixed
      income securities are amortized using the effective interest rate method.

      b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

      The Company's securities are valued at fair value in accordance with
      policies adopted by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

      (i)   Domestic exchange traded securities (other than options and those
            securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

            (1)   at their last composite sale price as reported on the
                  exchanges where those securities are traded; or

            (2)   if no sales of those securities are reported on a particular
                  day, the securities are valued based upon their composite bid
                  price for securities held long, or their composite asked price
                  for securities sold, not yet purchased, as reported by those
                  exchanges.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      (ii)  Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

            (1)   at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is the
                  last trade price at or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time)
                  adjusted up to NASDAQ's best offer price if the last traded
                  price is below such bid and down to NASDAQ's best offer price
                  if the last trade is above such offer price); or

            (2)   if no NOCP is available at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                  prior to the calculation of the net asset value of the
                  Company; or

            (3)   if no sale is shown on NASDAQ at the bid price; or

            (4)   if no sale is shown and no bid price is available, the price
                  will be deemed "stale" and the value will be determined in
                  accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth
                  herein.

      Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange are valued at their
      last sale price on the exchange where such securities are primarily
      traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular day, at their
      bid price (in the case of securities held long) or asked price (in the
      case of securities sold, not yet purchased) as reported by such exchange.
      Listed options are valued at their bid price (or asked price in the case
      of listed written options) as reported by the exchange with the highest
      volume on the last day a trade was reported. Other securities for which
      market quotations are readily available are valued at their bid price (or
      asked price in the case of securities sold, not yet purchased) as obtained
      from one or more dealers making markets for those securities. If market
      quotations are not readily available, the fair value of the securities and
      other assets are determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
      the Board of Managers.

      Foreign-denominated assets may involve more risks than domestic
      transactions, including political, economic, and regulatory risk. Risks
      may also arise from the potential inability of a counterparty to meet the
      terms of a contract and from unanticipated movements in the value of
      foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

      Securities associated with swaps are valued in accordance with the
      procedures described above, net of any contractual terms with the
      counterparty.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      Debt securities are valued in accordance with the procedures described
      above, which with respect to such securities may include the use of
      valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix to
      determine valuation for normal institutional size trading units or
      consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities. The Board of
      Managers will periodically monitor the reasonableness of valuations
      provided by any such pricing service. Debt securities with remaining
      maturities of 60 days or less will, absent unusual circumstances, be
      valued at amortized cost, so long as such valuation is determined by the
      Board of Managers to represent fair value.

      All assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are
      converted into U.S. dollars using foreign exchange rates provided by a
      pricing service compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time. Trading in foreign
      securities generally is completed, and the values of such securities are
      determined, prior to the close of securities markets in the U.S. Foreign
      exchange rates are also determined prior to such close. On occasion, the
      values of such securities and exchange rates may be affected by events
      occurring between the time such values or exchange rates are determined
      and the time that the net asset value of the Company is determined. When
      such events materially affect the values of securities held by the Company
      or its liabilities, such securities and liabilities are fair valued as
      determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of
      Managers.

      The determination of fair value shall take into account the relevant
      factors and surrounding circumstances, which may include: (i) the nature
      and pricing history (if any) of the security or other investment; (ii)
      whether any dealer quotations are available; (iii) possible valuation
      methodologies that could be used to determine fair value; (iv) the
      recommendation of the Adviser with respect to the valuation; (v) whether
      the same or similar securities or other investments are held by other
      accounts or other funds managed by the Adviser and the valuation method
      used by the Adviser with respect thereto; (vi) the extent to which the
      fair value to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae
      produced by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the
      liquidity or illiquidity of the market for the security or other
      investment.

      The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
      financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the
      Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      During the year ended, December 31, 2009, the Company followed
      authoritative guidance for fair value measurement. The guidance
      establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a hierarchy for
      inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable
      inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the
      most observable inputs be used when available. The guidance establishes
      three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      b. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Company's
      investments. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed
      below.

      Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for
      identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

      Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
      for similar securities, interest rates, prepayments speeds, credit risk,
      etc.).

      Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own
      assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

      The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
      an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.

      Additional information on the investments can be found in the Schedule of
      Portfolio Investments, the Schedule of Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased
      and the Schedule of Swap Contracts.

      The following is a summary of the inputs used, as of December 31, 2009, in
      valuing the Company's investments at fair value.

   2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      c. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

      The Company treats all highly liquid financial instruments that mature
      within three months at the time of purchase as cash equivalents.
      Restricted Cash represents funds held by the Custodian for securities held
      as collateral. At December 31, 2009, $129,474,944 in cash equivalents was
      held at PNC Bank in a money market account, as well as, foreign currency
      with a U.S. Dollar value of $2,837,363 was held at PFPC Trust Company.

      d. INCOME TAXES

      The Company has reclassified $15,379,828 and $30,565,615 from accumulated
      net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain on investments,
      respectively, to net capital contributions during the year ended December
      31, 2009. This reclassification was a result of permanent book to tax
      differences to reflect, as an adjustment to net capital contributions, the
      amounts of taxable loss and net realized gain on investments that have
      been allocated to the Company's Members and had no effect on net assets.

      In accordance with authoritative guidance, Management has analyzed the
      Company's tax position for all open tax years (tax years ended December
      31, 2006-2009), and has concluded that a liability of $3,142,315 capital
      gain country tax is required in the Company's financial statements. The
      Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to country tax
      expense within the Statement of Operations. During the period, the Company
      did not record any interest or penalties.

      Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its
      distributive share of the Company's taxable income or loss.

   3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

      Oppenheimer provides certain administrative services to the Company
      including, among other things, providing office space and other support
      services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
      monthly administration fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of the
      Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

      During the year ended December 31, 2009, Oppenheimer earned $88,229 as
      brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of
      the Company. Mainsail Group, L.L.C., a broker-dealer affiliate of Alkeon,
      earned $1,673,840 as brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions
      executed on behalf of the Company.

   3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

      Net profits or net losses of the Company for each fiscal period are
      allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of
      all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day of
      each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
      percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser, in its capacity as the
      Special Advisory Member of the Company, is entitled to receive an
      incentive allocation (the "Incentive Allocation"), charged to the capital
      account of each Member as of the last day of each allocation period, of
      20% of the amount by which net profits, if any, exceed the positive
      balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive Allocation
      is credited to the Special Advisory Account of the Adviser. By the last
      business day of the month following the date on which an Incentive
      Allocation is made, the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of the Incentive
      Allocation that was credited to the Special Advisory Account with respect
      to the allocation period. During the year ended December 31, 2009, an
      Incentive Allocation of $18,992,270 was credited to the Special Advisory
      Member's capital account and was included in withdrawals payable at
      December 31, 2009, in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members'
      Capital.

      Each member of the Board of Managers (each a "Manager") who is not an
      "interested person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
      annual retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each meeting attended. The lead
      independent Manager receives an additional fee of $2,500. Managers who are
      "interested persons" do not receive any annual or other fee from the
      Company. Managers who are not "interested persons" are reimbursed by the
      Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
      performing their duties.

      PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian") serves as custodian of the Company's
      assets.

      PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. ("PNC") serves as investor services
      and accounting agent to the Company and in that capacity provides certain
      accounting, recordkeeping and investor related services. The Company pays
      PNC an accounting and investor services fee based primarily on the average
      net assets of the Company as of the last day of each month, payable
      monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

      Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive placement agent for the Company,
      without special compensation from the Company, and bears costs associated
      with its activities as placement agent. However, the placement agent is
      entitled to charge a sales commission of up to 3% (up to 3.1% of the
      amount invested) in connection with a purchase of interests, at its
      discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, such sales commissions
      earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $493,023.

   4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

      The Company has entered into several contracts that contain routine
      indemnification clauses. The Company's maximum exposure under these
      arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be
      made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on
      experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

   5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

      Aggregate purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
      short-term securities, for the year ended December 31, 2009, amounted to
      $2,150,838,257 and $2,159,378,959, respectively. Aggregate purchases and
      sales of securities sold, not yet purchased, excluding short-term
      securities, for the year ended December 31, 2009, amounted to
      $1,330,229,870 and $1,237,601,821, respectively.

      At December 31, 2009, the aggregate cost for Federal income tax purposes
      of portfolio investments, securities sold, not yet purchased, and
      purchased options was $822,081,478, $380,009,544 and $8,200,049,
      respectively.

      For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2009, accumulated net
      unrealized gain on portfolio investments, securities sold, not yet
      purchased, and purchased options was $133,011,400, consisting of
      $184,011,861 gross unrealized gain and $51,000,461 gross unrealized loss.

      Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
      yet purchased, net of excess cash, held at the prime broker as of December
      31, 2009, and is used as collateral for securities sold, not yet
      purchased.

   6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

      The Company has the ability to trade on margin and borrow funds from
      brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in equity securities on
      margin involves an initial cash requirement representing at least 50% of
      the underlying security's value with respect to transactions in U.S.
      markets and varying percentages with respect to transactions in foreign
      markets. The Act requires the Company to satisfy an asset coverage
      requirement of 300% of its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed,
      measured at the time the Company incurs the indebtedness. The Company pays
      interest on outstanding margin borrowings at an annualized rate of LIBOR
      plus 0.875%. The Company pledges securities as collateral for the margin
      borrowings, which are maintained in a segregated account held by the
      Custodian. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the average daily amount
      of such borrowings was $7,505,392 and the daily weighted average
      annualized interest rate was 1.07%. The Company had borrowings outstanding
      at December 31, 2009, totaling $2,694,788 recorded as due to broker on the
      Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

   7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
      CREDIT RISK

      In the normal course of business, the Company may trade various financial
      instruments and enter into various investment activities with off-balance
      sheet risk. These financial instruments include options, swaps and
      securities sold, not yet purchased. Generally, these financial instruments
      represent future commitments to purchase or sell other financial
      instruments at specific terms at specified future dates. Each of these
      financial instruments contains varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk
      whereby changes in the market value of the securities underlying the
      financial instruments may be in excess of the amounts recognized in the
      Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may
      exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any
      losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any
      significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

      Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company to
      deliver specified securities and thereby creates a liability to purchase
      such securities in the market at prevailing prices. Accordingly, these
      transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the Company's ultimate
      obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold, not yet purchased may
      exceed the amount indicated in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
      Members' Capital. Primarily all investments in securities sold, not yet
      purchased and due from broker are positions with, and amounts due from,
      the prime broker, Morgan Stanley. Accordingly, the Company has a
      concentration of individual counterparty credit risk with the prime
      broker. The Company pledges securities in an account at PFPC Trust
      Company, for the benefit of the prime broker, to meet the margin
      requirement as determined by the prime broker.

      A swap is a contract under which two parties agree to make periodic
      payments to each other based on specified interest rates, an index or the
      value of some other instrument, applied to a stated, or "notional" amount.
      Swaps generally can be classified as interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
      commodity swaps or equity swaps which can also include contracts for
      difference, depending on the type of index or instrument used to calculate
      the payments. Such swaps would increase or decrease the Company's
      investment exposure to the particular interest rate, currency, commodity
      or equity involved. Securities associated with swaps are marked-to-market
      based on the Company's valuation procedures that are outlined in Section
      2b of these notes. The change in value of swaps, including the periodic
      amounts of interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as
      unrealized gains or losses in the Statement of Operations. Net unrealized
      gains are reported as an asset and net unrealized losses are reported as a
      liability on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. A
      realized gain or loss is recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic
      payment or termination of swap agreements.

      Most swap agreements entered into by the Company require the calculation
      of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a "net basis."
      Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement
      generally will be equal to only the net amount to be paid or received
      under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by
      each party to the agreement (the "net amount").

   7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
      CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

      The Company is subject to the market risk associated with changes in the
      value of the underlying investment or instrument, as well as exposure to
      credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance on swap
      contracts. The risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net
      amount of payments that the Company is contractually obligated to make. If
      the other party to a swap defaults, the Company's risk of loss consists of
      the net amount of payments that the Company contractually is entitled to
      receive, which may be different than the amounts recorded on the Statement
      of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      The unrealized appreciation/depreciation, rather than the notional amount,
      represents the approximate future cash to be received or paid,
      respectively.

      The Company may write (sell) put and call options on securities or
      derivative instruments in order to gain exposure to or protect against
      changes in the markets.

      The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays a
      premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Company
      bears the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
      counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options
      purchased are accounted for in the same manner as investment securities.
      The volume of activity of purchased options and swap contracts that are
      presented in the Schedule of Investments and Schedule of Swap Contracts,
      respectively, are consistent with the derivative activity during the year
      ended December 31, 2009.

      When the Company writes an option, the premium received by the Company is
      recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market
      value of the option written. If a written call option is exercised, the
      premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying security
      in determining whether the Company has realized a gain or loss. If a
      written put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the
      securities purchased by the Company. In writing an option, the Company
      bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the
      security or index underlying the written option. Exercise of a written
      option by a counterparty could result in the Company selling or buying a
      security at a price different from the current market value. During for
      the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company had no transactions in
      written options.

      The Company adopted amendments to authoritative guidance on disclosures
      about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The adoption requires
      qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using
      derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains
      and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about
      credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. All
      changes to accounting policies and disclosures have been made in
      accordance with the adop-

      options and swap contracts is reflected on the Statement of Operations
      within these financial statements. The net change in unrealized
      gain/(loss) on purchased options of $(375,589) is included in the net

      requirements did not materially impact the Company's financial statements.
      Option contracts serve as components of the Company's investment
      strategies and are utilized to structure investments to enhance the
      performance of the Company.

        POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

        Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio
        Manager also has day-to-day responsibilities with respect to one or
        more accounts. These potential conflicts include:

o       Allocation of Limited Time and Attention. Because the Portfolio Manager
        manages other accounts, the Portfolio Manager may not be able to
        formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive
        investment opportunities for each of those accounts as if the Portfolio
        Manager were to devote substantially more attention to the management
        of fewer accounts.

o       Allocation of Investment Opportunities. If the Portfolio Manager
        identifies an investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple
        accounts, the Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that
        opportunity because the opportunity may need to be allocated among all
        or many of these accounts.

o       Pursuit of Differing Strategies. At times, the Portfolio Manager may
        determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only
        some of the accounts for which he exercises investment responsibility,
        or may decide that certain of these accounts should take differing
        positions with respect to a particular security. In these cases, the
        Portfolio Manager may execute differing or opposite transactions for
        one or more accounts which may affect the market price of the security
        or the execution of the transactions, or both, to the detriment of one
        or more of his accounts.

o       Performance Fees. The Portfolio Manager manages other accounts that are
        subject to a performance allocation or performance fee which in some
        cases may be greater than the fee payable by the Fund. This could
        create a conflict because the Portfolio Manager may benefit if a more
        attractive investment is allocated to an account that bears a greater
        performance allocation or fee.

(A)(3)  COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
        MEMBERS

                                                                   December 2008

  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED
  PURSUANT TO RULES PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF
                                      2002

I.        COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

          This  code  of  ethics  (the  "Code")  of  the  registered  investment
companies set forth in Exhibit A (collectively,  the "Funds" and each, a "Fund")
applies to each Fund's principal executive officer,  principal financial officer
and principal  accounting  officer (the "Covered  Officers," each of whom is set
forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

o         honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

o         full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other  public  communications
          made by the Fund;

o         compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

o         the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

o         accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere to a high  standard of business
ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.       COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
          OF INTEREST


          OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private  interest  interferes  with the interests  of, or the Covered  Officer's
service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.


          Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and a Fund and  already  are  subject to conflict of interest
provisions  in the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended  ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended  ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered  Officers may not  individually  engage in
certain  transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other
property)  with a Fund  because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" of the
Fund.  The  compliance  programs and  procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent,  or identify and correct,  violations  of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and  procedures,  and such  conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code.  Although  typically  not  presenting  an  opportunity  for  improper
personal  benefit,  conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship  between a Fund and its investment adviser or a third party service
provider of which the Covered  Officers  are also  officers or  employees.  As a
result,  this Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers  will,  in the normal
course of their  duties  (whether  formally for the  applicable  Fund or for its
investment  adviser or a third  party  service  provider,  or for one or more of
them), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will
have different  effects on the adviser,  third party service  provider and Fund.
The  participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual  relationship  between a Fund and its adviser or third party service
provider and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
duties as  officers of the Fund.  The  foregoing  activities,  if  performed  in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

<PAGE>

          Other  conflicts  of interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act and the Investment  Advisers Act. The overarching  principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered  Officer  should not be placed  improperly  before the  interest  of the
Company.

          Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o         not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit  personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

o         not cause the Fund to take  action,  or fail to take  action,  for the
          individual  personal  benefit of the Covered  Officer  rather than the
          benefit the Fund; and

o         report  at  least   annually   his  or  her   affiliations   or  other
          relationships  that could  potentially  present a conflict of interest
          with the Fund.

III.      DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

o         Each  Covered  Officer  of a  Fund  shall  become  familiar  with  the
          disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

o         each Covered  Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly  misrepresent,  or
          cause others to misrepresent,  facts about the Fund to others, whether
          within or outside the Fund,  including  to the Fund's  management  and
          auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators  and   self-regulatory
          organizations;

o         each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent  appropriate  within
          the Covered Officer's area of responsibility  and to the extent deemed
          necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer,  consult with
          other  officers and employees of the Fund and its  investment  adviser
          with  the  goal  of  promoting  full,  fair,   accurate,   timely  and
          understandable  disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
          with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications  made
          by the Fund; and

o         each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
          Fund with applicable  standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

<PAGE>

IV.       REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

          Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o         upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable,  upon becoming
          a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the
          Fund that the Covered  Officer has received,  read and understands the
          Code;

o         annually  thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that
          the Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

o         not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations of
          the Code that are made in good faith; and

o         notify the  Compliance  Officer of the Fund  promptly  if the  Covered
          Officer  knows of any  violation  of this  Code.  Failure  to do so is
          itself a violation of this Code.

          The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code
to specific  situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the
authority to interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult,  as  appropriate,  with counsel to
the Fund  and  counsel  to the  Managers  of the  Fund  who are not  "interested
persons," as defined by Section  2(a)(19) of the Investment  Company Act, of the
Fund (the  "Independent  Managers"),  and is encouraged to do so.  However,  any
approvals or waivers(1) must be considered by the Independent Managers.

          Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating  and enforcing
          this Code:

o         the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any reported potential violations;

o         if, after such investigation,  the Compliance Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
          any further action;

o         any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
          reported to the Independent Managers;

o         if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred,  the
          Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
          which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of,
          and appropriate  modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment adviser
          or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to dismiss the
          Covered Officer; and

o         any changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent  required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

- -------------------------
(1)       For this purpose,  the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund
          of a material  departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the
          Fund's  failure  to take  action  within a  reasonable  period of time
          regarding a material  departure from a provision of the code of ethics
          that has been made known to Fund management.

<PAGE>

V.        OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code  shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted  by the Funds for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions  of this  Code.  The  code of  ethics  under  Rule  17j-1  under  the
Investment  Company  Act of each Fund,  its  investment  adviser  and  principal
underwriter  is a separate  requirement  applying  to the Covered  Officers  and
others, and is not part of this Code.

VI.       AMENDMENTS

          Amendments  to this  Code may be made  from  time to time,  as  deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance  Officer.  The Board of each Fund shall be
informed  of any such  amendment  to the extent  deemed  material  by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.

VII.      CONFIDENTIALITY

          All  reports and records  relating  to a Fund  prepared or  maintained
pursuant to this Code will be  considered  confidential  and shall be maintained
and  protected  accordingly.  Except as otherwise  required by law or this Code,
such matters  shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's  investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.

VIII.     INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not  constitute  an  admission,  by or on behalf  of any  Fund,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

           CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE 30A-2(A) UNDER THE 1940 ACT

1.        I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Advantage Advisers
          Xanthus Fund, LLC;

2.        Based on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
          statement  of a  material  fact  or  omit to  state  a  material  fact
          necessary to make the statements  made, in light of the  circumstances
          under which such  statements were made, not misleading with respect to
          the period covered by this report;

3.        Based on my knowledge,  the financial statements,  and other financial
          information  included in this report,  fairly  present in all material
          respects the financial  condition,  results of operations,  changes in
          net assets,  and cash flows (if the financial  statements are required

          for, the periods presented in this report;

4.        The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
          establishing  and maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as

          internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
          under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

          (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused such
               disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under our
               supervision,  to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is made
               known to us by others within those entities,  particularly during
               the period in which this report is being prepared;

          (b)  Designed  such  internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or
               caused such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to be
               designed under our supervision,  to provide reasonable  assurance
               regarding  the   reliability  of  financial   reporting  and  the
               preparation  of financial  statements  for  external  purposes in
               accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

          (c)  Evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
               controls  and   procedures  and  presented  in  this  report  our

               and  procedures,  as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
               date of this report based on such evaluation; and

               control over financial  reporting that occurred during the second
               fiscal  quarter of the period  covered  by this  report  that has
               materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially
               affect,   the   registrant's   internal  control  over  financial
               reporting; and

5.        The registrant's  other certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
          the registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
          board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a)  All  significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting
               which are reasonably  likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability  to record,  process,  summarize,  and  report  financial
               information; and

          statement  of a  material  fact  or  omit to  state  a  material  fact
          necessary to make the statements  made, in light of the  circumstances
          under which such  statements were made, not misleading with respect to
          the period covered by this report;

3.        Based on my knowledge,  the financial statements,  and other financial

          to include a  statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and
          for, the periods presented in this report;

4.        The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
          establishing  and maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as

          internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
          under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

          (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused such
               disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under our
               supervision,  to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is made
               known to us by others within those entities,  particularly during

               regarding  the   reliability  of  financial   reporting  and  the
               preparation  of financial  statements  for  external  purposes in
               accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

          (c)  Evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
               controls  and   procedures  and  presented  in  this  report  our

               and  procedures,  as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
               date of this report based on such evaluation; and

               control over financial  reporting that occurred during the second
               fiscal  quarter of the period  covered  by this  report  that has
               materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially
               affect,   the   registrant's   internal  control  over  financial
               reporting; and

               design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting
               which are reasonably  likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability  to record,  process,  summarize,  and  report  financial
               information; and

          (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves management or
