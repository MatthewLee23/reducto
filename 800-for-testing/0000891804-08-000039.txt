CHAIRMAN'S
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[GRAPHIC OMITTED] | Timothy R. Schwertfeger | Chairman of the Board

Once again, I am pleased to report that over the twelve-month period covered by
this report your Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly tax-free
income. For more details about the management strategy and performance of your
Fund, please read the Portfolio Manager's Comments, the Dividend and Share Price
Information, and the Performance Overview sections of this report.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to report some important news about
Nuveen Investments. The firm recently was acquired by a group led by Madison
Dearborn Partners, LLC. While this affects the corporate structure of Nuveen
Investments, it has no impact on the investment objectives, portfolio management
strategies or dividend policy of your Fund.

With the recent volatility in the stock market, many have begun to wonder which
way the market is headed, and whether they need to adjust their holdings of
investments. No one knows what the future will bring, which is why we think a
well-balanced portfolio that is structured and carefully monitored with the help
of an investment professional is an important component in achieving your
long-term financial goals. A well-diversified portfolio may actually help to
reduce your overall investment risk, and we believe that investments like your
Nuveen Investments Fund can be important building blocks in a portfolio crafted
to perform well through a variety of market conditions.

We also are pleased to be able to offer you a choice concerning how you receive
your shareholder reports and other Fund information. As an alternative to mailed
copies, you can sign up to receive future Fund reports and other Fund
information by e-mail and the internet. The inside front cover of this report
contains information on how you can sign up.

We are grateful that you have chosen us as a partner as you pursue your
financial goals and we look forward to continuing to earn your trust in the
months and years ahead. At Nuveen Investments, our mission continues to be to
assist you and your financial advisor by offering investment services and
products that can help you to secure your financial objectives.

Sincerely,

\s\ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S COMMENTS

Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds | NQI, NIO, NIF,
                                              | NPX, NVG, NEA

PORTFOLIO MANAGER PAUL BRENNAN DISCUSSES U.S. ECONOMIC AND MUNICIPAL MARKET
CONDITIONS, KEY INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, AND THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE OF THESE SIX
INSURED FUNDS. PAUL HAS 18 YEARS OF INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING OVER 16 YEARS
AT NUVEEN. PAUL ASSUMED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NQI, NIO, NIF,
NPX, NVG AND NEA IN 2006.

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE ANNUAL
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2007?

Between November 1, 2006, and October 31, 2007, the yield on the benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note dropped 14 basis points to end the reporting period
at 4.47%. In the municipal bond rate market, the yield on the Bond Buyer 25
Revenue Bond Index, a widely followed measure of longer-term municipal bond
market rates, fell to 4.67% at the end of October 2007, a decline of 11 basis
points from the end of October 2006. These numbers, however, do not give a true
indication of the events of the summer of 2007, when developments in the credit
markets led to increased volatility, tightening liquidity and a flight to
quality. This was particularly evident in August, when market concerns about
defaults on subprime mortgages resulted in a liquidity crisis across all fixed
income asset classes. (NONE OF THESE FUNDS HAD EXPOSURE TO THE COLLATERALIZED
DEBT PRODUCTS THAT WERE AT THE CENTER OF THIS LIQUIDITY CRISIS.)

After fourteen months of remaining on the sidelines, the Federal Reserve
responded to credit market volatility by cutting the fed funds rate by 50 basis
points--from 5.25% to 4.75%--in September 2007 and another 25 basis points--to
4.50%--in October 2007. A corresponding decline in short-term municipal bond
interest rates, coupled with a jump in longer-term municipal bond interest
rates, produced a steepening of the yield curve late in the reporting period.
For the annual period, bonds with longer maturities generally underperformed
shorter maturity bonds. In addition, as the markets repriced risk, higher
quality bonds generally outperformed lower quality credits.

The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), a closely watched measure of economic
growth, expanded at below-trend levels of 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and
0.6% in the first quarter of 2007 before rebounding sharply to 3.8% in the
second quarter of 2007 (all GDP numbers are annualized). In the third quarter of
2007, increases in consumer spending, business investment, and exports helped
GDP

growth climb to 4.9%, overcoming a 20% decline in residential investment. Driven
largely by higher energy and food prices, the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
registered a 3.5% year-over-year gain as of October 2007. The labor market
continued to be tight, with a national unemployment rate of 4.7% in October
2007, up from 4.4% in October 2006. October 2007 marked the 50th consecutive
month of employment growth, the longest such stretch in U.S. history.

Over the twelve months ended October 2007, municipal bond issuance nationwide
totaled $487.9 billion, an increase of 27% from the previous twelve months. One
factor in this increased volume was an increase in advance refundings,(1) driven
by attractive borrowing rates for issuers during the earlier part of this
period. For the majority of the period, the strength and diversity of demand for
municipal bonds were as important as supply, as the surge in issuance was
absorbed by a broad-based universe of traditional and nontraditional buyers,
including retail investors, property and casualty insurance companies, hedge
funds and arbitragers and overseas investors.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THIS REPORTING
PERIOD?

With the substantial increase in municipal issuance nationwide during this
reporting period, our investment strategies continued to focus on finding
opportunities in undervalued sectors and individual securities with the
potential to add value to the Funds. Even though these are insured Funds, we
were able to take advantage of the credit situation and buy insured bonds with
weaker underlying credits that represented value prospects. The majority of our
purchases were bonds at the longer end of the yield curve. As the yield curve
steepened, bonds in this part of the curve generally offered some incremental
yield to help support the Funds' dividends. These purchases also helped to
offset the shortening of the Funds' portfolio duration(2) due to bond calls and
the natural tendency of bond durations to shorten as time passes.

NVG and NEA, which can invest up to 20% of their assets in uninsured
investment-grade quality securities, also purchased modest amounts of Ohio bonds
issued as part of the Buckeye Tobacco Settlement Financing Authority's $5.5
billion offering, the largest tobacco settlement financing deal ever issued.

To generate cash for purchases, we generally sold bonds that were nearing their
redemption dates, particularly some of the Funds' pre-refunded holdings. The
proceeds from these sales were reinvested out longer on the yield curve, which
helped to maintain the Funds' durations within our preferred strategic range and
improve the Funds' overall call protection profile.

(1)   Advance refundings, also known as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur
      when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
      interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
      lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

(2)   Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
      change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
      changes than bonds with shorter durations.

                                                                               5

<PAGE>


In the municipal bond interest rate environment over the past twelve months, we
also continued to emphasize a disciplined approach to duration management and
yield curve positioning. As part of our duration management strategies, we used
inverse floating rate securities(3), a type of derivative financial instrument,
in all six of these Funds. These inverse floaters had the dual benefit of
bringing the Funds' durations closer to our preferred strategic target and
enhancing their income-generation capabilities. In addition, NPX used forward
interest rate swaps, another type of derivative financial instrument. The goal
of this strategy was to help us manage net asset value (NAV) volatility without
having a negative impact on income streams or common share dividends over the
short term.

HOW DID THE FUNDS PERFORM?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as relevant index and peer group
information, are presented in the accompanying table.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2007, the total return on NAV for NEA
exceeded the return on the Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index, while
the remaining five Funds underperformed this index. All six of the Funds in this
report outperformed the average return for the Funds' Lipper Insured Municipal
Debt Fund's Average for this period.

(3)   An inverse floating rate security is a financial instrument designed to
      pay long-term tax-exempt interest at a rate that varies inversely with a
      short-term tax-exempt interest rate index. For the Nuveen Funds, the index
      typically used is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets (SIFM)
      Municipal Swap Index (previously referred to as the Bond Market
      Association Index or BMA). Inverse floaters, including those inverse
      floating rate securities in which the Funds invested during the reporting
      period, are further defined within the "Notes to Financial Statements" and
      "Glossary of Terms Used in This Report" sections of this shareholder
      report.

(4)   The Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged,
      unmanaged national index comprising a broad range of insured municipal
      bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

One of the key factors in the performance of these Funds relative to that of the
unleveraged Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index over this period was
the use of financial leverage. The returns of all of these Funds were negatively
impacted by their use of leverage. Although leveraging provides opportunities
for additional income and total return for common shareholders, it can also
expose shareholders to additional risk when market conditions are unfavorable.
With the increases in yields on longer municipal bonds, the impact of valuation
changes in these bonds was magnified by the use of leverage. However, we firmly
believe that the use of this strategy should work to the benefit of the Funds
over the long term.

Other factors that influenced the Funds' returns included yield curve
positioning and duration management, the use of derivatives, credit quality and
sector allocations.

During this twelve-month period, bonds in the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index with maturities between one and eight years, especially those maturing in
approximately three years, benefited the most from changes in the interest rate
environment. As a result, these bonds generally outperformed credits with longer
maturities. Bonds having the longest maturities (22 years and longer) posted the
worst returns for the period. In general, the varying levels of exposure to the
longer part of the yield curve among these Funds was a major factor in their
performance relative to one another. NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX tended to be more
heavily weighted in the longer part of the curve than NVG or NEA. This heavier
weighting was the result of extending the maturities of these Funds as part of
efforts to support their earnings.

Overall, NVG and NEA were better positioned in terms of duration, with less
exposure to the underperforming long part of the curve compared with the other
four Funds in this report. This included fewer holdings of zero coupon bonds,
which performed very poorly. Of these two Funds, NEA had relatively less
exposure to longer-term bonds than NVG, which resulted in better performance in
an environment where the slope of the municipal yield curve steepened.

Because they effectively increased exposure to longer maturity bonds during a
period when shorter maturities were in favor in the market, the inverse floaters
in place in these six Funds had a negative overall impact on return performance
for the period. At the same time, however, the inverse floaters benefited these
Funds by helping to support their income streams. We believe that, over time,
these derivative financial instruments will work to the advantage of the Funds.

                                                                               7

<PAGE>


As the markets repriced risk and interest rates on longer municipal bonds rose,
higher quality bonds generally outperformed lower quality credits for the first
time in several years. Insured bonds as a sector also slightly outperformed the
municipal market as a whole. Both of these factors were generally positive for
the performance of these insured Funds.

Sectors of the market that performed well included transportation, special
tax-backed issues and water and sewer. Pre-refunded bonds, especially those that
were advance refunded before longer municipal interest rates began to rise in
mid-2007, also performed well.

DIVIDEND AND SHARE PRICE
                   INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As previously noted, all of the Funds in this report use leverage to potentially
enhance opportunities for additional income for common shareholders. Although
the Funds' use of this strategy continued to provide incremental income, the
extent of this benefit was reduced due to short-term interest rates that
remained relatively high during most of this period. This, in turn, kept the
Funds' borrowing costs high. The Funds' income streams were also impacted as the
proceeds from older, higher-yielding bonds that matured or were called were
reinvested into bonds currently available in the market, which generally offered
lower yields during the majority of this period. These factors resulted in one
monthly dividend reduction in NIO and NPX and two in NIF and NVG over the
twelve-month period ended October 31, 2007. The dividends of NQI and NEA
remained stable throughout this reporting period.

Due to normal portfolio activity, common shareholders of NIO received a
long-term capital gains distribution of $0.0190 per share at the end of December
2006.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2007, all of
the Funds in this report except NIO had negative UNII balances for financial
statement purposes and positive UNII balances for tax purposes. NIO had a
positive UNII balance for both financial statement and tax purposes.

      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                                                                              15

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS/TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS
NUVEEN INSURED QUALITY MUNICIPAL FUND, INC.
NUVEEN INSURED MUNICIPAL OPPORTUNITY FUND, INC.
NUVEEN PREMIER INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND, INC.
NUVEEN INSURED PREMIUM INCOME MUNICIPAL FUND 2
NUVEEN INSURED DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND
NUVEEN INSURED TAX-FREE ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2,
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free
Advantage Municipal Fund (the "Funds") as of October 31, 2007, and the related
statements of operations and cash flows (Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal
Fund 2 only) for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2007, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Municipal
Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2, Nuveen Insured Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund at
October 31, 2007, the results of their operations and cash flows (Nuveen Insured
Premium Income Municipal Fund 2 only) for the year then ended, changes in their
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of periods indicated therein in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

      All of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments are either covered by
      Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
      Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
      Government or U.S. Government agency securities, any of which ensure the
      timely payment of principal and interest.

      The Fund may invest in "zero coupon" securities. A zero coupon security
      does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life of
      the security. Tax- exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
      accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the
      security at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is
      effectively paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the
      Portfolio of Investments with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description.
      The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more volatile
      than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
      registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
      provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
      below BBB by Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
      below investment grade.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

</TABLE>

      All of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments are either covered by
      Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
      Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
      Government or U.S. Government agency securities, any of which ensure the
      timely payment of principal and interest.

      The Fund may invest in "zero coupon" securities. A zero coupon security
      does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life of
      the security. Taxexempt income to the holder of the security comes from
      accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the
      security at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is
      effectively paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the
      Portfolio of Investments with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description.
      The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more volatile
      than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
      registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
      provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
      below BBB by Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
      below investment grade.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

</TABLE>

      All of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments are either covered by
      Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
      Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
      Government or U.S. Government agency securities, any of which ensure the
      timely payment of principal and interest.

      The Fund may invest in "zero coupon" securities. A zero coupon security
      does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life of
      the security. Tax- exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
      accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the
      security at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is
      effectively paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the
      Portfolio of Investments with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description.
      The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more volatile
      than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
      registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
      provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
      below BBB by Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
      below investment grade.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

USD-LIBOR (United States Dollar-London Inter-Bank Offered Rate)

      All of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments, excluding temporary
      investments in short-term municipal securities, are either covered by
      Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
      Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
      Government or U.S. Government agency securities, any of which ensure the
      timely payment of principal and interest.

      The Fund may invest in "zero coupon" securities. A zero coupon security
      does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life of
      the security. Tax- exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
      accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the
      security at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is
      effectively paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the
      Portfolio of Investments with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description.
      The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more volatile
      than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
      registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
      provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
      below BBB by Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
      below investment grade.

(4)   Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
      changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified market
      index.

(5)   Effective date represents the date on which both the Fund and counterparty
      commence interest payment accruals on each forward swap contract.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140.

                                 SEE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

</TABLE>

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that are either
      covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
      Portfolio Insurance which ensures the timely payment of principal and
      interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets
      attributable to Preferred shares) may be invested in municipal securities
      that are (i) either backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient
      U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities (also ensuring the
      timely payment of principal and interest), or (ii) rated, at the time of
      investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by
      Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch) or unrated but judged to be of
      comparable quality by the Adviser.

      The Fund may invest in "zero coupon" securities. A zero coupon security
      does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life of
      the security. Tax- exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
      accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the
      security at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is
      effectively paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the
      Portfolio of Investments with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description.
      The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more volatile
      than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
      registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
      provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public

                  =================================================================================================================
</TABLE>

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that are either
      covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
      Portfolio Insurance which ensures the timely payment of principal and
      interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets
      attributable to Preferred shares) may be invested in municipal securities
      that are (i) either backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient
      U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities (also ensuring the
      timely payment of principal and interest), or (ii) rated, at the time of
      investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by
      Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch) or unrated but judged to be of
      comparable quality by the Adviser.

      The Fund may invest in "zero coupon" securities. A zero coupon security
      does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life of
      the security. Tax- exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
      accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the
      security at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is
      effectively paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the
      Portfolio of Investments with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description.
      The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more volatile
      than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.



(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
      registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
      the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
      provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
      securities may be subject to peri- odic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public
      accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard &
      Poor's") or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings
      below BBB by Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
      below investment grade.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

WI/DD Purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140. SEE ACCOMPANYING
      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier
Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Common shares of
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
diversified management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

INVESTMENT VALUATION

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service may establish fair value based on
yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for a municipal bond or forward swap
contract, each Fund may use a market price or fair market value quote provided
by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined that the
market price or fair market value for an investment or derivate transaction is
unavailable or inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or
its designee, may establish a fair value for the investment. Temporary
investments in securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying
them as short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2007, Insured
Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) had outstanding when-issued/delayed delivery purchase
commitments of $798,109. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in
any of the other Funds.

INVESTMENT INCOME

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

                                                                              79

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal and applicable state
income taxes, if any, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the
alternative minimum tax applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt
status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. Net realized capital gains
and ordinary income distributions paid by the Funds are subject to federal
taxation.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

PREFERRED SHARES

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

</TABLE>

INSURANCE

Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest only in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred
shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance. Each Fund may
also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
securities, or (ii) rated, at

80

<PAGE>


the time of investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by
Moody's, Standard & Poor's or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by
Nuveen Asset Management ("the Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

INVERSE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES

Each Fund may invest in inverse floating rate securities. An inverse floating
rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed
interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. In turn,
this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in face amounts equal to some
fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market value, that typically pay
short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties, and (b) issues to a
long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse floating rate
certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that represents all
remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received by the inverse
floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the floating
rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse floater holder
bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside investment risk and
also benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating rate security will be
more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the interest rate is
dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying bond but also on
the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates, and because the
inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of loss of the greater
face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). A Fund may also enter into shortfall and
forbearance agreements (sometimes referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit
recovery swap") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund agrees to reimburse the
broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the difference between the
liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the trust and the liquidation
value of the floating rate certificates, as well as any shortfalls in interest
cash flows. The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the Fund the right (a) to
cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to tender their notes at
par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate bond held by the trust
to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment in an
externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as an "Inverse floating rate investment". An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater, recourse trust or credit recovery swap is
accounted for as a financing transaction in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities". In such
instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited into a special purpose trust is
identified in the Portfolio of Investments as an "Underlying bond of an inverse
floating rate trust", with the Fund accounting for the short-term floating rate
certificates issued by the trust as "Floating rate obligations" on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the Fund reflects in Investment Income
the entire earnings of the underlying bond and accounts for the related interest
paid to the holders of the short-term floating rate certificates as "Interest
expense on floating rate obligations" in the Statement of Operations.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, each Fund invested in externally
deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

The average floating rate obligations outstanding and average annual interest
rate and fees related to self-deposited inverse floaters during the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2007, were as follows:

FORWARD SWAP TRANSACTIONS

The Funds are authorized to invest in forward interest rate swap transactions.
Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve
each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or
variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve
the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather
is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to
terminate its forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to
the credit risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment
to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon termination. To reduce such credit
risk, all counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the
daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold.
Reciprocally, when any of the Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract,
the Funds have instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as
collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss
above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate, either up or
down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount. Insured Premium Income 2
(NPX) was the only Fund to invest in forward swap transactions during the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2007.

CUSTODIAN FEE CREDIT

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which the Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to the treatment of paydown gains and losses, timing differences
in recognizing taxable market discount, timing differences in recognizing
certain gains and losses on investment transactions and the treatment of
investments in inverse floating rate transactions subject to SFAS No. 140. To
the extent that differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are
reclassified within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities presented in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and
permanent differences do not impact the net asset values of the Funds.

At October 31, 2007, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the
Adviser, and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets
within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund
shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as
well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
of each Fund as follows:

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
      the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
      preferred stock issued by or borrowings by the Nuveen funds) of
      Nuveen-sponsored funds in the U.S.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and
expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

The Adviser has not agreed to reimburse Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) for any
portion of its fees and expenses beyond November 30, 2010.

As a result of certain trading errors that occurred during the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and Insured Opportunity (NIO) were
reimbursed $27,762 and $42,338, respectively, by the Adviser to offset losses
realized on the disposal of investments in violation of investment guidelines.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

On June 20, 2007, Nuveen Investments announced that it had entered into a
definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") with Windy City
Investments, Inc. ("Windy City"), a corporation formed by investors led by
Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC ("Madison Dearborn"), pursuant to which Windy
City would acquire Nuveen Investments. Madison Dearborn is a private equity
investment firm based in Chicago, Illinois. The merger was consummated on
November 13, 2007.

The consummation of the merger was deemed to be an "assignment" (as that term is
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) of the investment management
agreement between each Fund and the Adviser, and resulted in the automatic
termination of each Fund's agreement. The Board of Directors/Trustees of each
Fund has approved a new investment management agreement with the Adviser at the
same fee rate. The new ongoing agreement was approved by the shareholders of
each Fund and took effect on November 13, 2007.

                                                                              87

 | Notes to
 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The investors led by Madison Dearborn include an affiliate of Merrill Lynch. As
a result, Merrill Lynch is an indirect "affiliated person" (as that term is
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) of each Fund. Certain conflicts
of interest may arise as a result of such indirect affiliation. For example, the
Funds are generally prohibited from entering into principal transactions with
Merrill Lynch and its affiliates. The Adviser does not believe that any such
prohibitions or limitations as a result of Merrill Lynch's affiliation with
significantly impact the ability of the Funds to pursue their investment
objectives and policies.

6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INTERPRETATION NO. 48

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48).
FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. SEC guidance allows
funds to delay implementing FIN 48 into NAV calculations until the fund's last
NAV calculation in the first required financial statement reporting period. As a
result, the Funds must begin to incorporate FIN 48 into their NAV calculations
by April 30, 2008. At this time, management is continuing to evaluate the
implications of FIN 48 and does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 will have a
significant impact on the net assets or results of operations of the Funds.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
NO. 157

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements." This standard establishes a single authoritative definition of
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires
additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value measurements already required or permitted by existing standards.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting principles from the
application of this standard relate to the definition of fair value, the methods
used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of October 31, 2007, management does not believe the adoption
of SFAS No. 157 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional
disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements
and the effect of certain of the measurements included within the Statement of
Operations for the period.

*     Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period takes place over
      several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market price,
      so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price used in
      the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of changes
      in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net asset
      value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value, if
      any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid on
      the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be reinvested
      at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the last
      dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's market
      price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different from
      the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***   During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and
      Insured Opportunity (NIO) received payments from the Adviser of $27,762
      and $42,338, respectively, to offset losses realized on the disposal of
      investments purchased in violation of each Fund's investment restrictions.
      This reimbursement did not have an impact on the Funds' Total Return on
      Common Share Net Asset Value.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares.

(a)   Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
      inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

*     Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period takes place over
      several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market price,
      so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price used in
      the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of changes
      in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net asset
      value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value, if
      any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid on
      the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be reinvested
      at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the last
      dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's market
      price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different from
      the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares.

(a)   Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
      inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

*     Annualized.

**    Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period takes place over
      several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market price,
      so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price used in
      the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of changes
      in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net asset
      value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value, if
      any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid on
      the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be reinvested
      at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the last
      dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's market
      price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different from
      the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

***   After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares.

(a)   Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
      inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

(b)   For the period November 21, 2002 (commencement of operations) through
      October 31, 2003.

(2)   For Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX), Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and
      Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA), Board Members serve three year terms,
      except for two board members who are elected by the holders of Preferred
      Shares. The Board of Trustees for NAD, NXZ and NZF is divided into three
      classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, with each being elected to
      serve until the third succeeding annual shareholders' meeting subsequent
      to its election or thereafter in each case when its respective successors
      are duly elected or appointed, except two board members are elected by the
      holders of Preferred Shares to serve until the next annual shareholders'
      meeting subsequent to its election or thereafter in each case when its
      respective successors are duly elected or appointed. For Insured Quality
      (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO) and Premier Insured Income (NIF), the
      Board Members serve a one year term to serve until the next annual meeting
      or until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified. The
      first year elected or appointed represents the year in which the board
      member was first elected or appointed to any fund in the Nuveen Complex.

(3)   Nuveen Advisory Corp. and Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp. were
      reorganized into Nuveen Asset Management, effective January 1, 2005.

(4)   Officers serve one year terms through July of each year. The year first
      elected or appointed represents the year in which the Officer was first
      elected or appointed to any fund in the Nuveen Complex.

                                                                              99

Annual Investment
Management Agreement
                                                                APPROVAL PROCESS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board Members are responsible for overseeing the performance of the
investment adviser to the Funds and determining whether to continue the advisory
arrangements. At the annual review meeting held on May 21, 2007 (the "May
Meeting"), the Board Members of the Funds, including the Independent Board
Members, unanimously approved the continuance of the Investment Management
Agreement between each Fund (each, a "Fund") and Nuveen Asset Management
("NAM"). The foregoing Investment Management Agreements with NAM are hereafter
referred to as the "Original Investment Management Agreements."

Subsequent to the May Meeting, Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"), the parent
company of NAM, entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of
Nuveen by Windy City Investments, Inc., a corporation formed by investors led by
Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC ("MDP"), a private equity investment firm (the
"Transaction"). Each Original Investment Management Agreement, as required by
Section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), provides for
its automatic termination in the event of its "assignment" (as defined in the
1940 Act). Any change in control of the adviser is deemed to be an assignment.
The consummation of the Transaction will result in a change of control of NAM as
well as its affiliated sub-advisers and therefore cause the automatic
termination of each Original Investment Management Agreement, as required by the
1940 Act. Accordingly, in anticipation of the Transaction, at a meeting held on
July 31, 2007 (the "July Meeting"), the Board Members, including the Independent
Board Members, unanimously approved new Investment Management Agreements (the
"New Investment Management Agreements") with NAM on behalf of each Fund to take
effect immediately after the Transaction or shareholder approval of the new
advisory contracts, whichever is later. The 1940 Act also requires that each New
Investment Management Agreement be approved by the respective Fund's
shareholders in order for it to become effective. Accordingly, to ensure
continuity of advisory services, the Board Members, including the Independent
Board Members, unanimously approved Interim Investment Management Agreements to
take effect upon the closing of the Transaction if shareholders have not yet
approved the New Investment Management Agreements.

Because the information provided and considerations made at the annual review
continue to be relevant with respect to the evaluation of the New Investment
Management Agreements, the Board considered the foregoing as part of its
deliberations of the New Investment Management Agreements. Accordingly, as
indicated, the discussions immediately below outline the materials and
information presented to the Board in connection with the Board's prior annual
review and the analysis undertaken and the conclusions reached by Board Members
when determining to continue the Original Investment Management Agreements.

I. APPROVAL OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS

During the course of the year, the Board received a wide variety of materials
relating to the services provided by NAM and the performance of the Funds. At
each of its quarterly meetings, the Board reviewed investment performance and
various matters relating to the operations of the Funds and other Nuveen funds,
including the compliance program, shareholder services, valuation, custody,
distribution and other information relating to the nature, extent and quality of
services provided by NAM. Between the regularly scheduled quarterly meetings,
the Board Members received information on particular matters as the need arose.

In preparation for their considerations at the May Meeting, the Independent
Board Members received extensive materials, well in advance of the meeting,
which outlined or are related to, among other things:

o     the nature, extent and quality of services provided by NAM;

o     the organization and business operations of NAM, including the
      responsibilities of various departments and key personnel;

100

<PAGE>


o     each Fund's past performance as well as the Fund's performance compared to
      funds with similar investment objectives based on data and information
      provided by an independent third party and to customized benchmarks;

o     the profitability of Nuveen and certain industry profitability analyses
      for unaffiliated advisers;

o     the expenses of Nuveen in providing the various services;

o     the advisory fees and total expense ratios of each Fund, including
      comparisons of such fees and expenses with those of comparable,
      unaffiliated funds based on information and data provided by an
      independent third party (the "Peer Universe") as well as compared to a
      subset of funds within the Peer Universe (the "Peer Group") of the
      respective Fund (as applicable);

o     the advisory fees NAM assesses to other types of investment products or
      clients;

o     the soft dollar practices of NAM, if any; and

o     from independent legal counsel, a legal memorandum describing among other
      things, applicable laws, regulations and duties in reviewing and approving
      advisory contracts.

At the May Meeting, NAM made a presentation to, and responded to questions from,
the Board. Prior to and after the presentations and reviewing the written
materials, the Independent Board Members met privately with their legal counsel
to review the Board's duties in reviewing advisory contracts and considering the
renewal of the advisory contracts. The Independent Board Members, in
consultation with independent counsel, reviewed the factors set out in judicial
decisions and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") directives relating to
the renewal of advisory contracts. As outlined in more detail below, the Board
Members considered all factors they believed relevant with respect to each Fund,
including, but not limited to, the following: (a) the nature, extent and quality
of the services to be provided by NAM; (b) the investment performance of the
Fund and NAM; (c) the costs of the services to be provided and profits to be
realized by Nuveen and its affiliates; (d) the extent to which economies of
scale would be realized; and (e) whether fee levels reflect those economies of
scale for the benefit of the Fund's investors. In addition, as noted, the Board
Members met regularly throughout the year to oversee the Funds. In evaluating
the Original Investment Management Agreements, the Board Members also relied
upon their knowledge of NAM, its services and the Funds resulting from their
meetings and other interactions throughout the year. It is with this background
that the Board Members considered each Original Investment Management Agreement.

A. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

In considering the renewal of the Original Investment Management Agreements, the
Board Members considered the nature, extent and quality of NAM's services. The
Board Members reviewed materials outlining, among other things, Nuveen's
organization and business; the types of services that NAM or its affiliates
provide and are expected to provide to the Funds; the performance record of the
applicable Fund (as described in further detail below); and, any initiatives
Nuveen had taken for the municipal fund product line. As noted, at the annual
review, the Board Members were already familiar with the organization,
operations and personnel of NAM due to the Board Members' experience in
governing the respective Funds and working with NAM on matters relating to the
Funds. With respect to personnel, the Board Members recognized NAM's investment
in additional qualified personnel throughout the various groups in the
organization and recommended to NAM that it continue to review staffing needs as
necessary. In addition, the Board Members reviewed materials describing the
current status and, in particular, the developments in 2006 with respect to
NAM's investment process, investment strategies (including additional tools used
in executing such strategies), personnel (including portfolio management and
research teams), trading process, hedging activities, risk management operations
(e.g., reviewing credit quality, duration limits, and derivatives use, as
applicable), and investment operations (such as enhancements to trading
procedures, pricing procedures, and client services). The Board Members
recognized NAM's investment of resources and efforts to continue to enhance and
refine its investment process.

                                                                             101

<PAGE>


 | ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 | APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)

In addition to advisory services, the Independent Board Members considered the
quality of administrative and non-advisory services provided by NAM and noted
that NAM and its affiliates provide the Funds with a wide variety of services
and officers and other personnel as are necessary for the operations of the
Funds, including:

o     product management;

o     fund administration;

o     oversight by shareholder services and other fund service providers;

o     administration of Board relations;

o     regulatory and portfolio compliance; and

o     legal support.

As the Funds operate in a highly regulated industry and given the importance of
compliance, the Board Members considered, in particular, Nuveen's compliance
activities for the Funds and enhancements thereto. In this regard, the Board
Members recognized the quality of Nuveen's compliance team. The Board Members
further noted Nuveen's negotiations with other service providers and the
corresponding reduction in certain service providers' fees at the May Meeting.

In addition to the foregoing services, the Board Members also noted the
additional services that NAM or its affiliates provide to Nuveen's closed-end
funds, including, in particular, its secondary market support activities. The
Board Members recognized Nuveen's continued commitment to supporting the
secondary market for the common shares of its closed-end funds through a variety
of programs designed to raise investor and analyst awareness and understanding
of closed-end funds. These efforts include:

o     maintaining shareholder communications;

o     providing advertising for the Nuveen closed-end funds;

o     maintaining its closed-end fund website;

o     maintaining continual contact with financial advisers;

o     providing educational symposia;

o     conducting research with investors and financial analysis regarding
      closed-end funds; and

o     evaluating secondary market performance.

With respect to the Nuveen closed-end funds that utilize leverage through the
issuance of preferred shares ("Preferred Shares"), the Board Members noted
Nuveen's continued support for the holders of Preferred Shares by, among other
things:

o     maintaining an in-house trading desk;

o     maintaining a product manager for the Preferred Shares;

o     developing distribution for Preferred Shares with new market participants;

o     maintaining an orderly auction process;

o     managing leverage and risk management of leverage; and

o     maintaining systems necessary to test compliance with rating agency
      criteria.

Based on their review, the Board Members found that, overall, the nature, extent
and quality of services provided (and expected to be provided) to the respective
Funds under the Original Investment Management Agreements were satisfactory.

B. THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS AND NAM

At the May Meeting, the Board considered the investment performance for each
Fund, including the Fund's historic performance as well as its performance
compared to funds with similar investment objectives (the "Performance Peer
Group") based on data provided by an independent third party (as described
below). The Board Members also reviewed the respective Fund's portfolio level
performance (which does not reflect fund level fees and expenses, and leverage)
against customized benchmarks, described in further detail below.

In evaluating the performance information during the annual review at the May
Meeting, in certain instances, the Board Members noted that the closest
Performance Peer Group for a fund may not adequately reflect such fund's
investment objectives and strategies, thereby limiting the usefulness of the
comparisons of such fund's performance with that of the Performance Peer Group.

With respect to state-specific municipal funds, the Board Members also
recognized that certain funds do not have a corresponding state-specific
Performance Peer Group in which case their performance is measured against a
more general municipal category for various states. With respect to municipal
closed-end funds, funds that do not have corresponding state-specific
Performance Peer Groups are from states other than New York, California,
Florida, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania. However, with respect to funds
based in Florida, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the peer group may be
so small or the Nuveen funds may dominate the category to such an extent that
performance information for such funds was also compared to the more general
category for all states (other than New York and California).

The Board Members reviewed performance information including, among other
things, total return information compared with the Fund's Performance Peer Group
for the one-, three- and five-year periods (as applicable) ending December 31,
2006. The Board Members also reviewed the Fund's portfolio level performance
(which does not reflect fund level fees and expenses, and leverage) compared to
customized portfolio level benchmarks for the one- and three-year periods ending
December 31, 2006 (as applicable). The analysis was used to assess the efficacy
of investment decisions against appropriate measures of risk and total return,
within specific market segments. This information supplemented the Fund
performance information provided to the Board at each of its quarterly meetings.
Based on their review, the Board Members determined that each Fund's investment
performance over time had been satisfactory, subject to the following. With
respect to various municipal closed-end funds, the Board Members noted relative
total return underperformance in recent years compared to peers. The Board
Members reviewed materials and discussed with NAM the factors contributing to
the shift in performance including, among other things, the degree of risk
undertaken by peers compared to the municipal closed-end funds (such as through
the increased use of leverage or taking concentrated positions in high risk
credits). In addition, the Board Members also considered a fund's dividend
performance and the extent of any secondary market discounts. The Board Members
noted NAM's efforts to evaluate the factors affecting performance and determine
whether modification to a fund's investment strategy is necessary or
appropriate, and concluded that they were satisfied with the steps being taken.

C. FEES, EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY

      1. FEES AND EXPENSES

      During the annual review, in evaluating the management fees and expenses
      of a Fund, the Board reviewed, among other things, the Fund's advisory
      fees (net and gross management fees) and total expense ratios (before and
      after expense reimbursements and/or waivers) in absolute terms as well as
      comparisons to the gross management fees (before waivers), net management
      fees (after waivers) and total expense ratios (before and after waivers)
      of comparable funds in the Peer Universe and the Peer Group. In reviewing
      the fee schedule for a Fund, the Board Members considered the fund-level
      and complex-wide breakpoint schedules (described in further detail below)
      and any fee waivers and reimbursements provided by Nuveen (applicable, in
      particular, for certain funds launched since 1999). The Board Members
      further reviewed data regarding the construction of Peer Groups as well as
      the methods of measurement for the fee and expense analysis and the
      performance analysis. In certain cases, due to the small number of peers
      in the Peer Universe, the Peer Universe and Peer Group had significant
      overlap or even consisted entirely of the same unaffiliated funds. In
      reviewing the comparisons of fee and expense information, the Board
      Members recognized that in certain cases, the fund size relative to peers,
      the small size and odd composition of the Peer Group (including
      differences

                                                                             103

<PAGE>


 | ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 | APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)

      in objectives and strategies), expense anomalies, timing of information
      used or other factors impacting the comparisons thereby limited some of
      the usefulness of the comparative data. The Board Members also considered
      the differences in the use of leverage. Based on their review of the fee
      and expense information provided, the Board Members determined that each
      Fund's net total expense ratio was within an acceptable range compared to
      peers.

      2. COMPARISONS WITH THE FEES OF OTHER CLIENTS

      At the annual review, the Board Members further reviewed data comparing
      the advisory fees of NAM with fees NAM charges to other clients. With
      respect to municipal funds, such clients include NAM's municipal
      separately managed accounts. In general, the advisory fees charged for
      separate accounts are somewhat lower than the advisory fees assessed to
      the Funds. The Board Members considered the differences in the product
      types, including, but not limited to, the services provided, the structure
      and operations, product distribution and costs thereof, portfolio
      investment policies, investor profiles, account sizes and regulatory
      requirements. The Board Members noted, in particular, that the range of
      services provided to the Funds (as discussed above) is much more extensive
      than that provided to separately managed accounts. As described in further
      detail above, such additional services include, but are not limited to:
      product management, fund administration, oversight of third party service
      providers, administration of Board relations, and legal support. The Board
      Members noted that the Funds operate in a highly regulated industry
      requiring extensive compliance functions compared to other investment
      products. Given the inherent differences in the products, particularly the
      extensive services provided to the Funds, the Board Members believe such
      facts justify the different levels of fees.

      3. PROFITABILITY OF NUVEEN

      In conjunction with its review of fees, the Board Members also considered
      the profitability of Nuveen for its advisory activities (which
      incorporated Nuveen's wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisers) and its
      financial condition. At the annual review, the Board Members reviewed the
      revenues and expenses of Nuveen's advisory activities for the last three
      years, the allocation methodology used in preparing the profitability data
      as well as the 2006 Annual Report for Nuveen. The Board Members noted this
      information supplemented the profitability information requested and
      received during the year to help keep them apprised of developments
      affecting profitability (such as changes in fee waivers and expense
      reimbursement commitments). In this regard, the Board Members noted the
      enhanced dialogue and information regarding profitability with NAM during
      the year, including more frequent meetings and updates from Nuveen's
      corporate finance group. The Board Members also reviewed data comparing
      Nuveen's profitability with other fund sponsors prepared by three
      independent third party service providers as well as comparisons of the
      revenues, expenses and profit margins of various unaffiliated management
      firms with similar amounts of assets under management prepared by Nuveen.

      In reviewing profitability, the Board Members recognized the subjective
      nature of determining profitability which may be affected by numerous
      factors, including the allocation of expenses. Further, the Board Members
      recognized the difficulties in making comparisons as the profitability of
      other advisers generally is not publicly available and the profitability
      information that is available for certain advisers or management firms may
      not be representative of the industry and may be affected by, among other
      things, the adviser's particular business mix, capital costs, types of
      funds managed and expense allocations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board Members reviewed Nuveen's methodology
and assumptions for allocating expenses across product lines to determine
profitability. Last year, the Board Members also designated an Independent Board
Member as a point person for the Board to review the methodology determinations
during the year and any refinements thereto, which relevant information produced
from such process was reported to the full Board. In reviewing profitability,
the Board Members recognized Nuveen's increased investment in its fund business.
Based on its review, the Board Members concluded that Nuveen's level of
profitability for its advisory activities was reasonable in light of the
services provided.

In evaluating the reasonableness of the compensation, the Board Members also
considered other amounts paid to NAM by the Funds as well as any indirect
benefits (such as soft dollar arrangements, if any) NAM and its affiliates
receive, or are expected to receive, that are directly attributable to the
management of the

104

<PAGE>


Funds, if any. See Section E below for additional information on indirect
benefits NAM may receive as a result of its relationship with the Funds. Based
on their review of the overall fee arrangements of each Fund, the Board Members
determined that the advisory fees and expenses of the Funds were reasonable.

D. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THESE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

With respect to economies of scale, the Board Members recognized the potential
benefits resulting from the costs of a Fund being spread over a larger asset
base. To help ensure the shareholders share in these benefits, the Board Members
reviewed and considered the breakpoints in the advisory fee schedules that
reduce advisory fees. In addition to advisory fee breakpoints, the Board also
approved a complex-wide fee arrangement in 2004. Pursuant to the complex-wide
fee arrangement, the fees of the funds in the Nuveen complex, including the
Funds, are reduced as the assets in the fund complex reach certain levels. In
evaluating the complex-wide fee arrangement, the Board Members noted that the
last complex-wide asset level breakpoint for the complex-wide fee schedule was
at $91 billion and that the Board Members anticipated further review and/or
negotiations prior to the assets of the Nuveen complex reaching such threshold.
Based on their review, the Board Members concluded that the breakpoint schedule
and complex-wide fee arrangement were acceptable and desirable in providing
benefits from economies of scale to shareholders, subject to further evaluation
of the complex-wide fee schedule as assets in the complex increase. See Section
II, Paragraph D - "Approval of the New Investment Management Agreements -
Economies of Scale and Whether Fee Levels Reflect These Economies of Scale" for
information regarding subsequent modifications to the complex-wide fee.

E. INDIRECT BENEFITS

In evaluating fees, the Board Members also considered any indirect benefits or
profits NAM or its affiliates may receive as a result of its relationship with
each Fund. With respect to closed-end funds, the Board Members considered the
revenues received by affiliates of NAM for serving as agent at Nuveen's
preferred trading desk and for serving as a co-manager in the initial public
offering of new closed-end exchange traded funds.

In addition to the above, the Board Members considered whether NAM received any
benefits from soft dollar arrangements whereby a portion of the commissions paid
by a Fund for brokerage may be used to acquire research that may be useful to
NAM in managing the assets of the Funds and other clients. With respect to NAM,
the Board Members noted that NAM does not currently have any soft dollar
arrangements; however, to the extent certain bona fide agency transactions that
occur on markets that traditionally trade on a principal basis and riskless
principal transactions are considered as generating "commissions," NAM intends
to comply with the applicable safe harbor provisions.

Based on their review, the Board Members concluded that any indirect benefits
received by NAM as a result of its relationship with the Funds were reasonable
and within acceptable parameters.

F. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The Board Members did not identify any single factor discussed previously as
all-important or controlling in their considerations to continue an advisory
contract. The Board Members, including the Independent Board Members,
unanimously concluded that the terms of the Original Investment Management
Agreements are fair and reasonable, that NAM's fees are reasonable in light of
the services provided to each Fund and that the renewal of the Original
Investment Management Agreements be approved.

II. APPROVAL OF THE NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS

Following the May Meeting, the Board Members were advised of the potential
Transaction. As noted above, the completion of the Transaction would terminate
each of the Original Investment Management Agreements. Accordingly, at the July
Meeting, the Board of each Fund, including the Independent Board Members,
unanimously approved the New Investment Management Agreements on behalf of the
respective Funds. Leading up to the July Meeting, the Board Members had several
meetings and deliberations with and without Nuveen management present, and with
the advice of legal counsel, regarding the proposed Transaction as outlined
below.

On June 8, 2007, the Board Members held a special telephonic meeting to discuss
the proposed Transaction. At that meeting, the Board Members established a
special ad hoc committee comprised solely of Independent Board Members to focus
on the Transaction and to keep the Independent Board Members

                                                                             105

<PAGE>


 | ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 | APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)

updated with developments regarding the Transaction. On June 15, 2007, the ad
hoc committee discussed with representatives of NAM the Transaction and
modifications to the complex-wide fee schedule that would generate additional
fee savings at specified levels of complex-wide asset growth. Following the
foregoing meetings and several subsequent telephonic conferences among
Independent Board Members and independent counsel, and between Independent Board
Members and representatives of Nuveen, the Board met on June 18, 2007 to further
discuss the proposed Transaction. Immediately prior to and then again during the
June 18, 2007 meeting, the Independent Board Members met privately with their
independent legal counsel. At that meeting, the Board met with representatives
of MDP, of Goldman Sachs, Nuveen's financial adviser in the Transaction, and of
the Nuveen Board to discuss, among other things, the history and structure of
MDP, the terms of the proposed Transaction (including the financing terms), and
MDP's general plans and intentions with respect to Nuveen (including with
respect to management, employees, and future growth prospects). On July 9, 2007,
the Board also met to be updated on the Transaction as part of a special
telephonic Board meeting. The Board Members were further updated at a special
in-person Board meeting held on July 19, 2007 (one Independent Board Member
participated telephonically). Subsequently, on July 27, 2007, the ad hoc
committee held a telephonic conference with representatives of Nuveen and MDP to
further discuss, among other things, the Transaction, the financing of the
Transaction, retention and incentive plans for key employees, the effect of
regulatory restrictions on transactions with affiliates after the Transaction,
and current volatile market conditions and their impact on the Transaction.

In connection with their review of the New Investment Management Agreements, the
Independent Board Members, through their independent legal counsel, also
requested in writing and received additional information regarding the proposed
Transaction and its impact on the provision of services by NAM and its
affiliates.

The Independent Board Members received, well in advance of the July Meeting,
materials which outlined, among other things:

o     the structure and terms of the Transaction, including MDP's co-investor
      entities and their expected ownership interests, and the financing
      arrangements that will exist for Nuveen following the closing of the
      Transaction;

o     the strategic plan for Nuveen following the Transaction;

o     the governance structure for Nuveen following the Transaction;

o     any anticipated changes in the operations of the Nuveen funds following
      the Transaction, including changes to NAM's and Nuveen's day-to-day
      management, infrastructure and ability to provide advisory, distribution
      or other applicable services to the Funds;

o     any changes to senior management or key personnel who work on Fund related
      matters (including portfolio management, investment oversight, and
      legal/compliance) and any retention or incentive arrangements for such
      persons;

o     any anticipated effect on each Fund's expense ratio (including advisory
      fees) following the Transaction;

o     any benefits or undue burdens imposed on the Funds as a result of the
      Transaction;

o     any legal issues for the Funds as a result of the Transaction;

o     the nature, quality and extent of services expected to be provided to the
      Funds following the Transaction, changes to any existing services and
      policies affecting the Funds, and cost-cutting efforts, if any, that may
      impact such services or policies;

o     any conflicts of interest that may arise for Nuveen or MDP with respect to
      the Funds;

o     the costs associated with obtaining necessary shareholder approvals and
      who would bear those costs; and

o     from legal counsel, a memorandum describing the applicable laws,
      regulations and duties in approving advisory contracts, including, in
      particular, with respect to a change of control.

<PAGE>


Immediately preceding the July Meeting, representatives of MDP met with the
Board to further respond to questions regarding the Transaction. After the
meeting with MDP, the Independent Board Members met with independent legal
counsel in executive session. At the July Meeting, Nuveen also made a
presentation and responded to questions. Following the presentations and
discussions of the materials presented to the Board, the Independent Board
Members met again in executive session with their counsel. As outlined in more
detail below, the Independent Board Members considered all factors they believed
relevant with respect to each Fund, including the impact that the Transaction
could be expected to have on the following: (a) the nature, extent and quality
of services to be provided; (b) the investment performance of the Funds; (c) the
costs of the services and profits to be realized by Nuveen and its affiliates;
(d) the extent to which economies of scale would be realized; and (e) whether
fee levels reflect those economies of scale for the benefit of investors. As
noted above, the Board Members had completed their annual review of the
respective Original Investment Management Agreements at the May Meeting and many
of the factors considered at the annual review were applicable to their
evaluation of the New Investment Management Agreements. Accordingly, in
evaluating the New Investment Management Agreements, the Board Members relied
upon their knowledge and experience with NAM and considered the information
received and their evaluations and conclusions drawn at the annual review. While
the Board reviewed many Nuveen funds at the July Meeting, the Independent Board
Members evaluated all information available to them on a fund-by-fund basis, and
their determinations were made separately in respect of each Fund.

A. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

In evaluating the nature, quality and extent of the services expected to be
provided by NAM under the New Investment Management Agreements, the Independent
Board Members considered, among other things, the expected impact, if any, of
the Transaction on the operations, facilities, organization and personnel of
NAM; the potential implications of regulatory restrictions on the Funds
following the Transaction; the ability of NAM and its affiliates to perform
their duties after the Transaction; and any anticipated changes to the current
investment and other practices of the Funds.

The Board noted that the terms of each New Investment Management Agreement,
including the fees payable thereunder, are substantially identical to those of
the Original Investment Management Agreement relating to the same Fund (with
both reflecting reductions to fee levels in the complex-wide fee schedule for
complex-wide assets in excess of $80 billion that have an effective date of
August 20, 2007). The Board considered that the services to be provided and the
standard of care under the New Investment Management Agreements are the same as
the Original Investment Management Agreements. The Board Members further noted
that key personnel who have responsibility for the Funds in each area, including
portfolio management, investment oversight, fund management, fund operations,
product management, legal/compliance and board support functions, are expected
to be the same following the Transaction. The Board Members considered and are
familiar with the qualifications, skills and experience of such personnel. The
Board also considered certain information regarding anticipated retention or
incentive plans designed to retain key personnel. Further, the Board Members
noted that no changes to Nuveen's infrastructure or operations as a result of
the Transaction were anticipated other than potential enhancements as a result
of an expected increase in the level of investment in such infrastructure and
personnel. The Board noted MDP's representations that it does not plan to have a
direct role in the management of Nuveen, appointing new management personnel, or
directly impacting individual staffing decisions. The Board Members also noted
that there were not any planned "cost cutting" measures that could be expected
to reduce the nature, extent or quality of services. After consideration of the
foregoing, the Board Members concluded that no diminution in the nature, quality
and extent of services provided to the Funds and their shareholders is expected.

In addition to the above, the Board Members considered potential changes in the
operations of each Fund. In this regard, the Board Members considered the
potential effect of regulatory restrictions on the Funds' transactions with
future affiliated persons. During their deliberations, it was noted that, after
the Transaction, a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch is expected to have an ownership
interest in Nuveen at a level that will make Merrill Lynch an affiliated person
of Nuveen. The Board Members recognized that applicable law would generally
prohibit the Funds from engaging in securities transactions with Merrill Lynch
as principal, and would also impose restrictions on using Merrill Lynch for
agency transactions. They recognized that having MDP and Merrill Lynch as
affiliates may restrict the Nuveen funds' ability to invest in securities of
issuers controlled by MDP or issued by Merrill Lynch and its affiliates even if
not bought directly from MDP or Merrill

                                                                             107

 | ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 | APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)

Lynch as principal. They also recognized that various regulations may require
the Nuveen funds to apply investment limitations on a combined basis with
affiliates of Merrill Lynch. The Board Members considered information provided
by NAM regarding the potential impact on the Nuveen funds' operations as a
result of these regulatory restrictions. The Board Members considered, in
particular, the Nuveen funds that may be impacted most by the restricted access
to Merrill Lynch, including: municipal funds (particularly certain
state-specific funds), senior loan funds, taxable fixed income funds, preferred
security funds and funds that heavily use derivatives. The Board Members
considered such funds' historic use of Merrill Lynch as principal in their
transactions and information provided by NAM regarding the expected impact
resulting from Merrill Lynch's affiliation with Nuveen and available measures
that could be taken to minimize such impact. NAM informed the Board Members
that, although difficult to determine with certainty, its management did not
believe that MDP's or Merrill Lynch's status as an affiliate of Nuveen would
have a material adverse effect on any Nuveen fund's ability to pursue its
investment objectives and policies.

In addition to the regulatory restrictions considered by the Board, the Board
Members also considered potential conflicts of interest that could arise between
the Nuveen funds and various parties to the Transaction and discussed possible
ways of addressing such conflicts.

Based on its review along with its considerations regarding services at the
annual review, the Board concluded that the Transaction was not expected to
adversely affect the nature, quality or extent of services provided by NAM and
that the expected nature, quality and extent of such services supported approval
of the New Investment Management Agreements.

B. PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS

With respect to the performance of the Funds, the Board considered that the
portfolio management personnel responsible for the management of the Funds'
portfolios were expected to continue to manage the portfolios following the
completion of the Transaction.

In addition, the Board Members recently reviewed Fund performance at the May
Meeting, as described above, and determined that Fund performance was
satisfactory or better, subject to the following. With respect to certain
municipal closed-end funds with relative short-term underperformance, the Board
Members concluded NAM was taking steps to evaluate the factors affecting
performance and those steps would continue following the Transaction. Further,
the investment policies and strategies were not expected to change as a result
of the Transaction.

In light of the foregoing factors, along with the prior findings regarding
performance at the annual review, the Board concluded that its findings with
respect to performance supported approval of the New Investment Management
Agreements.

C. FEES, EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY

As described in more detail above, during the annual review, the Board Members
considered, among other things, the management fees and expenses of the Funds,
the breakpoint schedules, and comparisons of such fees and expenses with peers.
At the annual review, the Board Members determined that the respective Fund's
advisory fees and expenses were reasonable. In evaluating the costs of services
to be provided by NAM under the New Investment Management Agreements and the
profitability of Nuveen for its advisory activities, the Board Members
considered their prior conclusions at the annual review and whether the
management fees or other expenses would change as a result of the Transaction.
As described above, the investment management fee is composed of two
components--a fund-level component and complex-wide level component. The fee
schedule under the New Investment Management Agreements to be paid to NAM is
identical to that under the Original Investment Management Agreements, including
the modified complex-wide fee schedule. As noted above, the Board recently
approved a modified complex-wide fee schedule that would generate additional fee
savings on complex-wide assets above $80 billion. The modifications have an
effective date of August 20, 2007 and are part of the Original Investment
Management Agreements. Accordingly, the terms of the complex-wide component
under the New Investment Management Agreements are the same as under the
Original Investment Management Agreements. The Board Members also noted that
Nuveen has committed for a period of two years from the

108

<PAGE>


date of closing of the Transaction that it will not increase gross management
fees for any Nuveen fund and will not reduce voluntary expense reimbursement
levels for any Nuveen fund from their currently scheduled prospective levels.
Based on the information provided, the Board Members did not expect that overall
Fund expenses would increase as a result of the Transaction.

In addition, the Board Members considered that additional fund launches were
anticipated after the Transaction which would result in an increase in total
assets under management in the complex and a corresponding decrease in overall
management fees under the complex-wide fee schedule. Taking into consideration
the Board's prior evaluation of fees and expenses at the annual renewal, and the
modification to the complex-wide fee schedule, the Board determined that the
management fees and expenses were reasonable.

While it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of the
Transaction on Nuveen's profitability, at the recent annual review, the Board
Members were satisfied that Nuveen's level of profitability for its advisory
activities was reasonable. During the year, the Board Members had noted the
enhanced dialogue regarding profitability and the appointment of an Independent
Board Member as a point person to review methodology determinations and
refinements in calculating profitability. Given their considerations at the
annual review and the modifications to the complex-wide fee schedule, the Board
Members were satisfied that Nuveen's level of profitability for its advisory
activities continues to be reasonable.

D. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THESE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The Board Members have been cognizant of economies of scale and the potential
benefits resulting from the costs of a Fund being spread over a larger asset
base. To help ensure that shareholders share in the benefits derived from
economies of scale, the Board adopted the complex-wide fee arrangement in 2004.
At the May Meeting, the Board Members reviewed the complex-wide fee arrangements
and noted that additional negotiations may be necessary or appropriate as the
assets in the complex approached the $91 billion threshold. In light of this
assessment coupled with the upcoming Transaction, at the June 15, 2007 meeting,
the ad hoc committee met with representatives of Nuveen to further discuss
modifications to the complex-wide fee schedule that would generate additional
savings for shareholders as the assets of the complex grow. The proposed terms
for the complex-wide fee schedule are expressed in terms of targeted cumulative
savings at specified levels of complex-wide assets, rather than in terms of
targeted marginal complex-wide fee rates. Under the modified schedule, the
schedule would generate additional fee savings beginning at complex-wide assets
of $80 billion in order to achieve targeted cumulative annual savings at $91
billion of $28 million on a complex-wide level (approximately $0.6 million
higher than those generated under the then current schedule) and generate
additional fee savings for asset growth above complex-wide assets of $91 billion
in order to achieve targeted annual savings at $125 billion of assets of
approximately $50 million on a complex-wide level (approximately $2.2 million
higher annually than that generated under the then current schedule). At the
July Meeting, the Board approved the modified complex-wide fee schedule for the
Original Investment Management Agreements and these same terms will apply to the
New Investment Management Agreements. Accordingly, the Board Members believe
that the breakpoint schedules and revised complex-wide fee schedule are
appropriate and desirable in ensuring that shareholders participate in the
benefits derived from economies of scale.

E. INDIRECT BENEFITS

During their recent annual review, the Board Members considered any indirect
benefits that NAM may receive as a result of its relationship with the Funds, as
described above. As the policies and operations of Nuveen are not anticipated to
change significantly after the Transaction, such indirect benefits should remain
after the Transaction. The Board Members further considered any additional
indirect benefits to be received by NAM or its affiliates after the Transaction.
The Board Members noted that other than benefits from its ownership interest in
Nuveen and indirect benefits from fee revenues paid by the Funds under the
management agreements and other Board-approved relationships, it was currently
not expected that MDP or its affiliates would derive any benefit from the Funds
as a result of the Transaction or transact any business with or on behalf of the
Funds (other than perhaps potential Fund acquisitions, in secondary market
transactions, of securities issued by MDP portfolio companies); or that Merrill
Lynch or its affiliates would derive any benefits from the Funds as a result of
the Transaction (noting that, indeed, Merrill Lynch would stand to experience
the discontinuation of principal transaction activity with the Nuveen funds and
likely would experience a noticeable reduction in the volume of agency
transactions with the Nuveen funds).

                                                                             109

<PAGE>


 | ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 | APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)

F. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

In addition to the factors above, the Board Members also considered the
following with respect to the Funds:

o     Nuveen would rely on the provisions of Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act.
      Section 15(f) provides, in substance, that when a sale of a controlling
      interest in an investment adviser occurs, the investment adviser or any of
      its affiliated persons may receive any amount or benefit in connection
      with the sale so long as (i) during the three-year period following the
      consummation of a transaction, at least 75% of the investment company's
      board of directors must not be "interested persons" (as defined in the
      1940 Act) of the investment adviser or predecessor adviser and (ii) an
      "unfair burden" (as defined in the 1940 Act, including any interpretations
      or no-action letters of the SEC) must not be imposed on the investment
      company as a result of the transaction relating to the sale of such
      interest, or any express or implied terms, conditions or understanding
      applicable thereto. In this regard, to help ensure that an unfair burden
      is not imposed on the Nuveen funds, Nuveen has committed for a period of
      two years from the date of the closing of the Transaction (i) not to
      increase gross management fees for any Nuveen fund; (ii) not to reduce
      voluntary expense reimbursement levels for any Nuveen fund from their
      currently scheduled prospective levels during that period; (iii) that no
      Nuveen fund whose portfolio is managed by a Nuveen affiliate shall use
      Merrill Lynch as a broker with respect to portfolio transactions done on
      an agency basis, except as may be approved in the future by the Compliance
      Committee of the Board; and (iv) that NAM shall not cause the Funds and
      other municipal funds that NAM manages, as a whole, to enter into
      portfolio transactions with or through the other minority owners of
      Nuveen, on either a principal or an agency basis, to a significantly
      greater extent than both what one would expect an investment team to use
      such firm in the normal course of business, and what NAM has historically
      done, without prior Board or Compliance Committee approval (excluding the
      impact of proportionally increasing the use of such other "minority
      owners" to fill the void necessitated by not being able to use Merrill
      Lynch).

o     The Funds would not incur any costs in seeking the necessary shareholder
      approvals for the New Investment Management Agreements (except for any
      costs attributed to seeking shareholder approvals of Fund specific matters
      unrelated to the Transaction, such as approval of Board Members, in which
      case a portion of such costs will be borne by the applicable Funds).

o     The reputation, financial strength and resources of MDP.

o     The long-term investment philosophy of MDP and anticipated plans to grow
      Nuveen's business to the benefit of the Nuveen funds.

o     The benefits to the Nuveen funds as a result of the Transaction including:
      (i) as a private company, Nuveen may have more flexibility in making
      additional investments in its business; (ii) as a private company, Nuveen
      may be better able to structure compensation packages to attract and
      retain talented personnel; (iii) as certain of Nuveen's distribution
      partners are expected to be equity or debt investors in Nuveen, Nuveen may
      be able to take advantage of new or enhanced distribution arrangements
      with such partners; and (iv) MDP's experience, capabilities and resources
      that may help Nuveen identify and acquire investment teams or firms and
      finance such acquisitions.

o     The historic premium and discount levels at which the shares of the Nuveen
      funds have traded at specified dates with particular focus on the premiums
      and discounts after the announcement of the Transaction, taking into
      consideration recent volatile market conditions and steps or initiatives
      considered or undertaken by NAM to address discount levels.

G. CONCLUSION

The Board Members did not identify any single factor discussed previously as
all-important or controlling. The Board Members, including the Independent Board
Members, unanimously concluded that the terms of the New Investment Management
Agreements are fair and reasonable, that the fees therein are reasonable in
light of the services to be provided to each Fund and that the New Investment
Management Agreements should be approved and recommended to shareholders.

III. APPROVAL OF INTERIM CONTRACTS

As noted above, at the July Meeting, the Board Members, including the
Independent Board Members, unanimously approved the Interim Investment
Management Agreements. If necessary to assure continuity of advisory services,
the Interim Investment Management Agreements will take effect upon the closing
of the Transaction if shareholders have not yet approved the New Investment
Management Agreements. The terms of each Interim Investment Management Agreement
are substantially identical to those of the corresponding Original Investment
Management Agreement and New Investment Management Agreement, respectively,
except for certain term and escrow provisions. In light of the foregoing, the
Board Members, including the Independent Board Members, unanimously determined
that the scope and quality of services to be provided to the Funds under the
respective Interim Investment Management Agreement are at least equivalent to
the scope and quality of services provided under the applicable Original
Investment Management Agreement.

                                                                             111

Reinvest Automatically
                                                         EASILY and CONVENIENTLY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET UP YOUR
REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per share may exceed
the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the acquisition of fewer
shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by
the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage commissions on open
market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These commissions usually
will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

112

<PAGE>


FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of
                                                       TERMS USED in this REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o     AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities are created by
      depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed interest rate, into a
      special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a)
      issues floating rate certificates typically paying short-term tax-exempt
      interest rates to third parties in amounts equal to some fraction of the
      deposited bond's par amount or market value, and (b) issues an inverse
      floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater")
      to an investor (such as a Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure
      to a long-term municipal bond. The income received by the holder of the
      inverse floater varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the
      floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the holder
      of the inverse floater bears substantially all of the underlying bond's
      downside investment risk. The holder of the inverse floater typically also
      benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
      underlying bond's value. Hence, an inverse floater essentially represents
      an investment in the underlying bond on a leveraged basis.

o     LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated
      by subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred
      shares issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and
      then dividing the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs
      are calculated at the end of each business day.

o     TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     ZERO COUPON BOND: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted a

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees determined that the registrant
has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 3 of
Form N-CSR) serving on its Audit Committee. The registrant's audit committee
financial expert is Jack B. Evans, Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is
"independent" for purposes of Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser ("SCI"). As part of his role as President and Chief Operating Officer,
Mr. Evans actively supervised the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") and
actively supervised the CFO's preparation of financial statements and other
filings with various regulatory authorities. In such capacity, Mr. Evans was
actively involved in the preparation of SCI's financial statements and the
resolution of issues raised in connection therewith. Mr. Evans has also served
on the audit committee of various reporting companies. At such companies, Mr.
Evans was involved in the oversight of audits, audit plans, and the preparation
of financial statements. Mr. Evans also formerly chaired the audit committee of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP the Audit Committee approved in advance all
audit services and non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the
Fund, except for those non-audit services that were subject to the pre-approval
exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The
pre-approval exception for services provided directly to the Fund waives the
pre-approval requirement for services other than audit, review or attest
services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes
no more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its
accountant during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (B) the
Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the
engagement; and (C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's
attention, and the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the
audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

                 SERVICES THAT THE FUND'S AUDITOR BILLED TO THE
                  ADVISER AND AFFILIATED FUND SERVICE PROVIDERS

The following tables show the amount of fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP to
Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM" or the "Adviser"), and any entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with NAM ("Control Affiliate") that

during the Fund's last two full fiscal years.

The tables also show the percentage of fees subject to the pre-approval
exception. The pre-approval exception for services provided to the Adviser and
any Affiliated Fund Service Provider (other than audit, review or attest
services) waives the pre-approval requirement if: (A) the aggregate amount of
all such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid to Ernst & Young LLP by the Fund, the Adviser and Affiliated Fund
Service Providers during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that
would have to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee; (B) the Fund did not
recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; and
(C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and
the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the Fund's audit is

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. The Audit
Committee is required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP
provides to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the
engagement related directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting
(except for those subject to the de minimis exception described above). The
Audit Committee requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about
any non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last
fiscal year to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The
Committee considered this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP's
independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the Audit
Committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the Audit Committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the Audit Committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the Audit Committee at
the next Audit Committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees has a separately designated
Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The
members of the audit committee are Robert P. Bremner, Jack B. Evans, William J.
Schneider and David J. Kundert. Mr. Eugene S. Sunshine, who also served as a
member of the Committee during this reporting period, resigned from the Board of
Directors or Trustees effective July 31, 2007.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

See Portfolio of Investments in Item 1.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant invests its assets primarily in municipal bonds and cash
management securities. On rare occasions the registrant may acquire, directly or
through a special purpose vehicle, equity securities of a municipal bond issuer
whose bonds the registrant already owns when such bonds have deteriorated or are
expected shortly to deteriorate significantly in credit quality. The purpose of
acquiring equity securities generally will be to acquire control of the
municipal bond issuer and to seek to prevent the credit deterioration or
facilitate the liquidation or other workout of the distressed issuer's credit
problem. In the course of exercising control of a distressed municipal issuer,
NAM may pursue the registrant's interests in a variety of ways, which may entail
negotiating and executing consents, agreements and other arrangements, and
otherwise influencing the management of the issuer. NAM does not consider such
activities proxy voting for purposes of Rule 206(4)-6 under the 1940 Act, but
nevertheless provides reports to the registrant's Board of Trustees on its
control activities on a quarterly basis.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer were to issue a proxy or that the
registrant were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security, NAM
would either engage an independent third party to determine how the proxy should
be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the instructions, of
the registrant's Board of Trustees or its representative. A member of NAM's
legal department would oversee the administration of the voting, and ensure that
records were maintained in accordance with Rule 206(4)-6, reports were filed
with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the results provided to the registrant's Board of
Trustees and made available to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER

The following individual has primary responsibility for the day-to-day
implementation of the registrant's investment strategies:

NAME                   FUND
PAUL BRENNAN           Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund

Other Accounts Managed. In addition to managing the registrant, the portfolio
manager is also primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of
the following accounts:

                           TYPE OF ACCOUNT            NUMBER OF
PORTFOLIO MANAGER              MANAGED                ACCOUNTS   ASSETS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Brennan       Registered Investment Company      14         $11.625 billion
                   Other Pooled Investment Vehicles   0          $0
                   Other Accounts                     1          $.7 million

*    Assets are as of October 31, 2007. None of the assets in these accounts are
     subject to an advisory fee based on performance.

Compensation. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of three basic
elements--base salary, cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation. The
compensation strategy is to annually compare overall compensation, including
these three elements, to the market in order to create a compensation structure
that is competitive and consistent with similar financial services companies. As
discussed below, several factors are considered in determining each portfolio
manager's total compensation. In any year these factors may include, among
others, the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended by the
portfolio manager's investment team, the investment performance of the accounts
managed by the portfolio manager, and the overall performance of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. (the parent company of NAM). Although investment performance
is a factor in determining the portfolio manager's compensation, it is not
necessarily a decisive factor. The portfolio manager's performance is evaluated
in part by comparing manager's performance against a specified investment
benchmark. This fund-specific benchmark is a customized subset (limited to bonds
in each Fund's specific state and with certain maturity parameters) of the
S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index, an index comprised of bonds held by
managed municipal bond fund customers of Standard & Poor's Securities Pricing,
Inc. that are priced daily and whose fund holdings aggregate at least $2
million. As of November 30, 2007, the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond Index was
comprised of 52,116 securities with an aggregate current market value of $1,034
billion.

Base salary. Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary that is set at a level
determined by NAM in accordance with its overall compensation strategy discussed
above. NAM is not under any current contractual obligation to increase a
portfolio manager's base salary.

Cash bonus. Each portfolio manager is also eligible to receive an annual cash
bonus. The level of this bonus is based upon evaluations and determinations made
by each portfolio manager's supervisors, along with reviews submitted by his
peers. These reviews and evaluations often take into account a number of
factors, including the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended to
the NAM's investment team, the performance of the accounts for which he serves
as portfolio manager relative to any benchmarks established for those accounts,
his effectiveness in communicating investment performance to stockholders and
their representatives, and his contribution to the NAM's investment process and
to the execution of investment strategies. The cash bonus component is also
impacted by the overall performance of Nuveen Investments, Inc. in achieving its
business objectives.

Long-term incentive compensation. Each portfolio manager is eligible to receive
bonus compensation in the form of equity-based awards issued in securities
issued by Nuveen Investments, Inc. The amount of such compensation is dependent
upon the same factors articulated for cash bonus awards but also factors in his
long-term potential with the firm.

Material Conflicts of Interest. Each portfolio manager's simultaneous management
of the registrant and the other accounts noted above may present actual or
apparent conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation and aggregation of
securities orders placed on behalf of the Registrant and the other account. NAM,
however, believes that such potential conflicts are mitigated by the fact that
the NAM has adopted several policies that address potential conflicts of
interest, including best execution and trade allocation policies that are
designed to ensure (1) that portfolio management is seeking the best price for
portfolio securities under the circumstances, (2) fair and equitable allocation
of investment opportunities among accounts over time and (3) compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. All accounts are to be treated in a
non-preferential manner, such that allocations are not based upon account
performance, fee structure or preference of the portfolio manager, although the
allocation procedures may provide allocation preferences to funds with special
characteristics (such as favoring state funds versus national funds for
allocations of in-state bonds). In addition, NAM has adopted a Code of Conduct
that sets forth policies regarding conflicts of interest.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of October 31, 2007, the portfolio
manager beneficially owned the following dollar range of equity securities
issued by the Registrant and other Nuveen Funds managed by NAM's municipal
investment team.

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
