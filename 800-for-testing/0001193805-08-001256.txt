A Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder

Financial markets weathered intense bouts of volatility in 2007, only to enter
2008 with no relief. January and February proved to be trying months for
equities, but strong ones for some areas of the bond market, as fears of an
economic recession swelled. The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed"), after cutting
the target federal funds rate 100 basis points (1%) between September 2007 and
year-end, more than matched those cuts in January alone. Responding to a slowing
economy and continued fallout from chaos in the credit markets, the Fed cut
interest rates 75 basis points in a rare unscheduled session on January 22, and
followed with a 50-basis-point cut at its regular meeting on January 30. Another
75-basis-point cut on March 18 brought the target rate to 2.25%.

Reverberations from the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse, and the associated
liquidity and credit crisis, continue to permeate global financial markets. The
S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks was down in February, marking the fourth
consecutive month of negative returns. International markets, while not
unscathed, generally have outperformed their U.S. counterparts so far in 2008.
Emerging markets, benefiting from stronger economic growth rates, have done
particularly well. In fixed income markets, fears related to the economic
slowdown and related credit crisis have led to a prolonged flight to quality.
Investors have largely shunned bonds associated with the housing and credit
markets in favor of higher-quality government issues. The yield on 10-year
Treasury issues, which touched 5.30% in June 2007 (its highest level in five
years), fell to 4.04% by year-end and to 3.53% by the end of February, while
prices correspondingly rose.

After setting a new-issuance record in 2007, supply in the municipal bond market
has been on the decline for four consecutive months (measured year over year).
The market has struggled with concerns around the creditworthiness of monoline
bond insurers and the failure of auctions for auction rate securities, driving
yields higher and prices lower across the curve. By period-end, municipal bonds
were trading at higher yields than their Treasury counterparts, a very unusual
occurrence by historical standards.

Against this backdrop, the major benchmark indexes posted mixed results for the
current reporting period, generally reflecting heightened investor risk
aversion:

Fund Summary as of February 29, 2008 (Unaudited)

Investment Objective

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. (MVF) seeks to provide shareholders with as high a
level of current income exempt from federal income taxes, as is consistent with
its investment policies and prudent investment management, by investing
primarily in a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations,
the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxes in the opinion of bond
counsel to the issuer.

Performance

For the six months ended February 29, 2008, the Fund returned -3.87% based on
market price, with dividends reinvested. The Fund's return based on net asset
value ("NAV") was -4.61%, with dividends reinvested. For the same period, the
Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category posted an average
return of -6.37% on a NAV basis. The Fund's recent NAV performance reflected our
neutral duration position, above-average yield relative to our Lipper peers, and
underweighting in insured municipal bonds, a segment of the market that has
suffered as pressure on municipal bond insurers affected the entire insured
municipal marketplace.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield
and net asset value of its common stock ("Common Stock"). However, these
objectives cannot be achieved in all interest rate environments. To leverage,
the Fund issues preferred stock ("Preferred Stock"), which pays dividends at
prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments, net of dividends to
Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the form of dividends,
and the value of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the per share net
asset value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to benefit Common
Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped; that is,
short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates. At the
same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit Common
Stock shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks of
leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and
possibly eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As of February 29, 2008, the Fund's leverage amount, due to Preferred Stock, was
38% of managed assets before the deduction of Preferred Stock.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. See Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements for
details of municipal bonds transferred to tender option bond trusts.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party
with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to
pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations
to pay the other party to the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The Fund's financial statements are
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which may require the use of management accruals and
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

Valuation of Investments: Municipal investments (including commitments to
purchase such investments on a "when-issued" basis) are valued on the basis of
prices provided by dealers or pricing services selected under the supervision of
the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board"). In determining the value of a
particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect
to transactions in such investments, quotations from bond dealers, market
transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between
investments. Swap agreements are valued by quoted fair values received daily by
the Fund's pricing service. Short-term securities may be valued at amortized
cost. Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at net asset value
each business day.

In the event that application of these methods of valuation results in a price
for an investment which is deemed not to be representative of the market value
of such investment, the investment will be valued by, under the direction of, or
in accordance with, a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value
("Fair Value Assets"). When determining the price for Fair Value Assets,
BlackRock Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. and/or the sub-advisor seeks to determine the price that the
Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset in
an arm's-length transaction. Fair value determinations shall be based upon all
available factors that the Advisor and/or sub-advisor deems relevant. The
pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a
committee thereof.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise if the value of the contract decreases due to an
unfavorable change in the price of the underlying security, or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps, which are over-the-counter ("OTC") contracts. In a forward
      interest rate swap, the Fund and the counter-party agree to make periodic
      net payments on a specified notional contract amount, commencing on a
      specified future effective date, unless terminated earlier. These periodic
      payments received or made by the Fund are recorded in the accompanying
      Statement of Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. Gains
      or losses are also realized upon termination of the swap agreements. Swaps
      are marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements. The Fund generally intends to close each forward interest
      rate swap before the accrual date specified in the agreement and therefore
      avoid entering into the interest rate swap underlying each forward
      interest rate swap.

      The Fund may utilize forward starting swaps for the purpose of reducing
      the interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio and decreasing the Fund's
      exposure to interest rate risk.

Municipal Bonds Transferred to Tender Option Bond Trusts: The Fund invests in
leveraged residual certificates ("TOB Residuals") issued by tender option bond
trusts ("TOBs"). A TOB is a special purpose entity established by a third party
sponsor into which the Fund, or an agent on behalf of the Fund, transfers
municipal securities. A TOB typically issues two classes of beneficial
interests: short-term floating rate certificates, which are sold to third party
investors, and residual certificates, which are generally issued to the Fund
which made the transfer or to affiliates of the Fund. The Fund's transfer of the
municipal securities to a TOB is accounted for as a financing transaction,
therefore the municipal securities deposited into a TOB are presented in the
Fund's Schedule of Investments and the proceeds from the transaction are
reported as a liability for trust certificates of the Fund. Similarly, proceeds
from residual certificates issued to affiliates, if any, from the transaction
are included in the liability for trust certificates. Interest income from the
underlying security is recorded by the Fund on an accrual basis. Interest
expense incurred on the secured borrowing and other expenses related to
remarketing, administration and trustee services to a TOB are reported as
expenses of the Fund. The floating rate certificates have interest rates that
generally reset weekly and their holders have the option to tender certificates
to the TOB for redemption at par at each reset date. The residual interest held
by the Fund include the right of the Fund (1) to cause the holders of a
proportional share of the floating rate certificates to tender their
certificates at par, and (2) to transfer a corresponding share of the municipal
securities from the TOB to the Fund. At February 29, 2008, the aggregate value
of the underlying municipal securities transferred to TOBs was $179,979,400, the
related liability for trust certificates was $88,513,610 and the range of
interest rates on the liability for trust certificates was 2.94% to 3.435%.

Financial transactions executed through TOBs generally will underperform the
market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment, but
tend to outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates decline
or remain relatively stable. Should short-term interest rates rise, the Fund's
investment in TOB Residuals likely will adversely affect the

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

Fund's net investment income and dividends to shareholders. Fluctuations in the
market value of municipal securities deposited into the TOB may adversely affect
the Fund's net asset value per share.

While the Fund's investment policies and restrictions expressly permit
investments in inverse floating rate securities such as TOB Residuals, they
generally do not allow the Fund to borrow money for purposes of making
investments. The Fund's Advisor believes that the Fund's restrictions on
borrowings do not apply to the liability for trust certificates reflected as a
result of the Fund's investment in TOB Residuals.

Income Taxes: It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income tax is required.

Effective February 29, 2008, the Fund implemented Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48
prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in
connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or
expected to be taken by an entity, including investment companies, before being
measured and recognized in the financial statements. The Advisor has evaluated
the application of FIN 48 to the Fund, and has determined that the adoption of
FIN 48 does not have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements. The
Fund files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax
returns are currently under examination. The statute of limitations on the
Fund's U.S. federal tax returns remains open for the years ended August 31, 2004
through August 31, 2006. The statutes of limitations on the Fund's state and
local tax returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon the
jurisdiction.

Investment Transactions and Investment Income: Investment transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (i.e., the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

Dividends and Distributions: Dividends to Common Stock shareholders from net
investment income are declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains
are recorded on the ex-dividend dates. Dividends and distributions to Preferred
Stock shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note 4.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2006, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The impact on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures, if any, is currently being assessed.

In addition, in February 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
("FAS 159"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal
year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects
to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. The impact on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures, if any, is currently being assessed.

Segregation: In cases in which the 1940 Act and the interpretive positions of
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") require that the Fund segregate
assets in connection with certain investments (e.g., swaps and when-issued
securities), the Fund will, consistent with certain interpretive letters issued
by the SEC, designate on its books and records cash or other liquid debt
securities having a market value at least equal to the amount that would
otherwise be required to be physically segregated.

Deferred Compensation and BlackRock Closed-End Share Equivalent Investment Plan:
Under the deferred compensation plan approved by the Fund's Board,
non-interested Directors ("Independent Directors") defer a portion of their
annual complex-wide compensation. Deferred amounts earn an approximate return as
though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in common shares of the other
BlackRock Closed-End Funds selected by the Independent Directors. This has
approximately the same economic effect for the Independent Directors as if the
Independent Directors had invested the deferred amounts directly in other
certain BlackRock Closed-End Funds. The deferred compensation, if any, is
included in other assets in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

The deferred compensation plan is not funded and obligations thereunder

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Other Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Advisor, to
provide investment advisory and administration services. Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. are principal
owners of BlackRock, Inc.

The Advisor is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays the Advisor a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.50% of the average daily
value of the Fund's net assets, including proceeds from the issuance of
Preferred Stock.

The Advisor has agreed to waive its advisory fees by the amount of investment
advisory fees the Fund pays to the Advisor indirectly through its investment in
affiliated money market funds. This amount is shown on the Statement of
Operations as fees waived by advisor.

In addition, the Advisor has entered into a separate sub-advisory agreement with
BlackRock Investment Management, LLC ("BIM"), an affiliate of the Advisor, under
which the Advisor pays BIM for services it provides, a monthly fee at an annual
rate that is a percentage of the investment advisory fee paid by the Fund to the
Advisor. For the six months ended February 29, 2008, the Fund reimbursed the
Advisor $8,458 for certain accounting services, which are included in accounting
services expenses in the Statement of Operations.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the six
months ended February 29, 2008 were $226,341,309 and $266,667,219, respectively.

4. Capital Stock Transactions:

Common Stock

The Fund is authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value
$0.10 per share all of which were initially classified as Common Stock. The
Board is authorized, however, to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of
capital stock without approval of the holders of Common Stock.

Shares issued and outstanding for the six months ended February 29, 2008 and
year ended August 31, 2007 increased by 101,978 and 267,589, respectively, as a
result of dividend reinvestments.

Preferred Stock

Preferred Stock of the Fund has a par value of $0.025 per share for Series A, B,
C, D and E and a par value of $0.10 per share for Series F and a liquidation
preference of $25,000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Preferred
Stock shareholders receive cash dividends at an annual rate that may vary for
the successive dividend periods for each series. The Fund is authorized to issue
10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. The yields in effect at February 29, 2008
were as follows: Series A, 3.20%; Series B, 3.205%; Series C, 3.217%; Series D,
3.00%; Series E, 3.172%; and Series F, 4.922%.

The Fund pays commissions to certain broker-dealers at the end of each auction
at an annual rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% calculated on the proceeds of
each auction. For the six months ended February 29, 2008, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, earned
$187,853 as commissions.

Dividends on seven-day Preferred Stock are cumulative at a rate that is reset
every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividends on 28-day
Preferred Stock are cumulative at a rate that resets every 28 days based on the
results of an auction. If the Preferred Stock fails to clear the auction on an
auction date, the Fund is required to pay the maximum applicable rate on the
Preferred Stock to holders of such stock for successive dividend periods until
such time as the stock is successfully auctioned. The maximum applicable rate on
the Preferred Stock for Series A, B, C, D and E is 110% of the interest
equivalent of the 30-day commercial paper rate and for Series F is the higher of
110% plus or times (i) the Telerate/BBA LIBOR or (ii) 90% of the Kenny S&P
30-day High Grade Index rate divided by 1.00 minus the marginal tax rate. During
the six months ended February 29, 2008, the Preferred Stock of the Fund was
successfully auctioned at each auction date until February 13, 2008. The low,
high and average dividend ranges on the Preferred Stock for the Fund for the six
months ended February 29, 2008 were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Low         High       Average

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

A Fund may not declare dividends or make other distributions on Common Stock or
purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration, distribution or
purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding Preferred Stock would
be less than 200%.

The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Fund, in whole or in
part, on any dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
unpaid dividends whether or not declared. The Preferred Stock is also subject to
mandatory redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the
composition of the assets and liabilities of the Fund, as set forth in the
Fund's Article of Incorporation/Articles Supplementary, are not satisfied.

The holders of Preferred Stock have voting rights equal to the holders of Common
Stock (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of Common Stock
as a single class. However, holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate
class, are also entitled to elect two Directors for the Fund. In addition, the
1940 Act requires that, along with approval by shareholders that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares (b)
change the Fund's subclassification as a closed-end investment company or change
its fundamental investment restrictions or (c) change its business so as to
cease to be an investment company.

Since February 13, 2008, the Preferred Stock of the Fund failed to clear any of
its auctions. As a result, the Preferred Stock dividend rates were reset to the
maximum applicable rate, which ranged from 3.17% to 4.92%. A failed auction is
not an event of default for the Fund but it is a liquidity event for the holders
of the Preferred Stock. A failed auction occurs when there are more sellers of a
fund's auction rate preferred stock than buyers. It is impossible to predict how
long this imbalance will last. A successful auction for the Fund's Preferred
Stock may not occur for a long time, if ever, and even if liquidity does resume,
holders of the Preferred Stock may not have the amount of liquidity they desire
or the ability to sell the Preferred Stock at par.

5. Capital Loss Carryforward:

As of August 31, 2007, the Fund had capital loss carryforwards available to
offset future realized capital gains of $13,312,422, all of which expires in
2009.

6. Concentration Risk:

The Fund concentrates its investments in securities issued by state agencies,
other governmental entities and U.S. Territories. The Fund is more susceptible
to adverse financial, social, environmental, economic, regulatory and political
factors that may affect these state agencies, other governmental entities and
U.S. Territories, which could seriously affect the ability of these states and
their municipal subdivisions to meet continuing obligations for principal and
interest payments and therefore could impact the value of the Fund's investments
and net asset value per share, than if the Fund was not concentrated in
securities issued by state agencies, other governmental entities and U.S.
Territories.

Many municipalities insure repayment of their obligations. Although bond
insurance reduces the risk of loss due to default by an issuer, such bonds
remain subject to the risk that market value may fluctuate for other reasons and
there is no assurance that the insurance company will meet its obligations.
These securities have been identified in the Schedule of Investments.

7. Subsequent Event:

The Fund paid a tax-exempt income dividend to holders of Common Stock in the
amount of $0.043000 per share on April 1, 2008 to shareholders of record on
March 14, 2008.

The dividends declared on Preferred Stock for the period March 1, 2008 to March
31, 2008 were as follows: Series A, $122,940; Series B, $116,140; Series C,
$102,100; Series D, $111,460; Series E, $169,740 and Series F, $207,562.

Additional Information

Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities, which comprises part of the financial information included in this
report.

documents. Mailings of your shareholder documents may be householded
