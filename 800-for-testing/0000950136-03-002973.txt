- ------------------------------
Market Price Yield (3)   7.02%
- ------------------------------

(1)  Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2)  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
     determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value
     at the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial
     investment and expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation
     assumes that all income dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained
     under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return does
     not reflect broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period
     of less than one year is not annualized. An investment in the Fund involves
     risk, including the loss of principal. Investment return, price, yield and
     net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. This data
     is provided for information only and is not intended for trading purposes.
     A portion of the income generated by the Fund may be subject to federal,
     state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the alternative
     minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
     offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of
     closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Net
     asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
     liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings
     are subject to change daily.

(3)  Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
     per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common
     share at September 30, 2003.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS III NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PIMCO Municipal Income Fund III ("Municipal III"), PIMCO California Municipal
Income Fund III ("California Municipal III") and PIMCO New York Municipal
Income Fund III ("New York Municipal III"), collectively referred to as the
"Funds", or "PIMCO Municipal Income Funds III" were organized as Massachusetts
business trusts on August 20, 2002. Prior to commencing operations on October
31, 2002, the Funds had no operations other than matters relating to their
organization and registration as closed-end management investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 6,981 shares
of beneficial interest of each Fund at an aggregate purchase price of $100,003
per Fund to Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PIMCO
Advisors Fund Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"), serves as the Fund's
Investment Manager and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is
an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Funds each have an
unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

Municipal III invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of
municipal bonds, the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes.
California Municipal III invests substantially all of its assets in municipal
bonds which pay interest that is exempt from federal and California state
income taxes. New York Municipal III invests substantially all of its assets in
municipal bonds which pay interest that is exempt from federal, New York State
and New York City income taxes. The Funds will seek to avoid bonds generating
interest income which could potentially subject individuals to alternative
minimum tax. The issuers' abilities to meet their obligations may be affected
by economic and political developments in a specific state or region.

Municipal III, California Municipal III and New York Municipal III issued
28,850,000, 19,500,000 and 5,000,000 shares of common stock, respectively, in
their initial public offerings. An additional 1,979,000, 1,634,000 and 424,000
shares of Municipal III, California Municipal III and New York Municipal III,
respectively, were issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option on December 13, 2002. These shares were all issued at
$15.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.675 per share. The
Investment Manager agreed to reimburse the amount by which the aggregate of
each Fund's organizational and common offering costs (other than the sales
load) exceeded $0.03 per share. Common offering costs of $873,326, $634,020 and
$162,720 (representing $0.03 per share for each Fund), were offset against the
proceeds of the offerings and have been charged to paid-in capital in excess of
par. For Municipal III, aggregate common offering costs and organizational
expenses were less than $0.03 per common share. Consequently, organizational
expenses of $15,000 were expensed in the current period. For California
Municipal III and New York Municipal III, aggregate offering costs and
organizational expenses exceeded $0.03 per common share, as a result, all
organizational expenses and offering costs exceeding $0.03 per common share
were reimbursed by the Investment Manager.

In addition, the underwriters commission and offering costs associated with the
Funds' issuance of Preferred Shares in the amounts of $2,700,000 and $335,618,
$1,850,000 and $263,574 and $470,000 and $160,882, for Municipal III,
California Municipal III and New York Municipal III, respectively, have been
charged to paid-in capital in excess of par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Funds'
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as such exposure would
involve claims that may be made against the Funds based upon events that have
not yet occurred. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Debt securities are valued daily by an independent pricing service approved by
the Boards of Trustees. Any security or other asset for which market quotations
are not readily available is valued at fair value as determined in good faith
under procedures established by the Boards of Trustees.

(b) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Funds intend to distribute all of their taxable income and to comply with
the other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS III NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2003
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
provision for U.S. federal income taxes is required. In addition, by
distributing substantially all of their taxable ordinary income and long-term
capital gains, if any, during each calendar year, the Funds intend not to be
subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

(c) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized daily to non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Funds declare dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. Each Fund records dividends and distributions to its
shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are considered
either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts
based on their federal income tax treatment; temporary differences do not
require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed
current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes,
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in
excess of par.

(e) CUSTODY CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES
The Funds benefit from an expense offset arrangement with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing securities,
they would have generated income for the Funds.

(f) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Funds are required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value
at the time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation
recorded is simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves
the risk of an imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures
contracts, interest rates and the underlying hedged assets, and the possible
inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(g) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
For hedging purposes, the Funds may purchase and write (sell) put and call
options on municipal bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements,
indexes or futures contracts which are standardized and traded on a U.S. or
other exchange, boards of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated
quotation system. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities.

The cost of securities acquired through the exercise of call options is
increased by the premiums paid. The proceeds from the securities sold through
the exercise of put options is decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a
put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Funds bear the market risk

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)
of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written
option. Exercise of an option written could result in the Funds purchasing a
security at price different from the current market price.

(h) RESIDUAL INTEREST MUNICIPAL BONDS (RIBS)
The Funds invest in residual interest Municipal Bond ("RIBS") whose interest
rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or
the value of an index. RIBS are created by dividing the income stream provided
by the underlying bonds to create two securities, one short-term and one
long-term. The interest rate on the short-term component is reset by an index
or auction process normally every seven to 35 days. After income is paid on the
short-term securities at current rates, the residual income from the underlying
bond(s) goes to the long-term securities. Therefore, rising short-term interest
rates result in lower income for the longer-term portion, and vice versa. The
longer-term bonds may be more volatile and less liquid than other Municipal
Bonds of comparable maturity. An investment in RIBS typically will involve
greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate bond.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the
"Agreements") with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to
each Fund. Subject to the supervision of each Fund's Board of Trustees, the
Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through
others selected by it, the investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's
business affairs and other administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,
the Investment Manager will receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at the
annual rate of 0.65% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net
assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order
to reduce Fund expenses, the Investment Manager has contractually agreed to
waive a portion of its investment management fee for each Fund at the annual
rate of 0.15% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets
attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding) from the
commencement of operations through October 31, 2007, and for a declining amount
thereafter through October 31, 2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment
Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), to manage each Fund's investments.
Subject to the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all
investment decisions for the Funds. The Investment Manager (not the Funds) pays
a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in return for its
services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.50% of each Fund's average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding). The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of
the fees it is entitled to receive from the Investment Manager, such that the
Sub-Adviser will receive 0.26% of each Fund's average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding) from the commencement of the Funds' operations through October 31,
2007, and will receive an increasing amount (not to exceed 0.50% of each Fund's
average daily net assets, including net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding) thereafter through October 31, 2009. The
Investment Manager informed the Funds that it paid the Sub-Adviser $1,586,214,
$1,071,414 and $277,189 in connection with sub-advisory services for Municipal
III, California Municipal III and New York Municipal III, respectively, for the
period ended September 30, 2003.

The Funds are subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Funds from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation
value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on
any matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

      at the current market price on the first day and a sale at the current
      market price on the last day for the period reported. Dividends are
      assumed, for purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS III REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of:
PIMCO Municipal Income Fund III, PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund III and
PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund III


In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities,
including the schedules of investments, and the related statements of
operations and of changes in net assets applicable to common shareholders and
the financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of each of PIMCO Municipal Income Fund III, PIMCO California
Municipal Income Fund III and PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund III
(collectively hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at September 30, 2003, and
the results of each of their operations, the changes in each of their net
assets applicable to common shareholders and the financial highlights for the
period October 31, 2002 (commencement of operations) through September 30,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Funds' management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at September
30, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS III TAX & OTHER INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAX INFORMATION (unaudited)

Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, required the
Funds to advise shareholders within 60 days of the Funds' tax year-end
(September 30, 2003) as to the federal tax status of dividends and
distributions received by shareholders during such tax year. Accordingly,
please note that substantially all dividends paid from net investment income
from the Funds during the tax period ended September 30, 2003 were federally
exempt interest dividends. However, the Funds invested in municipal bonds
containing market discount, whose accretion is taxable. Accordingly, the
percentage of dividends paid from net investment income during the tax period
which are taxable were:

<TABLE>
<S>                              <C>
Municipal III                    1.71%
California Municipal III         1.41%
New York Municipal III           0.26%
</TABLE>

Since the Funds' fiscal year is not the calendar year, another notification
will be sent with respect to calendar year 2003. In January 2004, you will be
advised on IRS Form 1099 DIV as to the federal tax status of the dividends and
distributions received during calendar year 2003. The amount that will be
reported, will be the amount to use on your 2003 federal income tax return and
may differ from the amount which must be reported in connection with each
Fund's tax year ended September 30, 2003. Shareholders are advised to consult
with their tax advisors as to the federal, state and local tax status of the
income received from the Funds. In January 2004, an allocation of interest by
state will be provided which may be of value in reducing a shareholder's state
or local tax liability, if any.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER INFORMATION

Since the Funds' inception on October 31, 2002, there has been no: (i) material
changes in the Funds' investment objectives or policies; (ii) changes to the
Funds' charter or by-laws (other than those included in each Fund's
registration statement on Form N-2 effective December 17, 2002); (iii) material
changes in the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Funds;
or (iv) change in the person primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of each Fund's portfolio.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS III DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pursuant to the Funds' Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all Common
Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
dividends, including any capital gain dividends, reinvested automatically in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders
(the "Plan Agent"), unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. An election
to receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the shareholder.
In the case of record shareholders such as banks, brokers or other nominees
that hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan
Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares
certified from time to time by the record shareholder as representing the total
amount registered in such shareholder's name and held for the account of
beneficial owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares
are held in the name of a bank, broker or nominee should contact the bank,
whose broker or nominee elects not to participate on the investor's behalf),
will be paid in cash by check mailed, in the case of direct shareholder, to the
record holder by PFPC Inc., as the Funds' dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee) elects not to participate in the Plan,
the number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value on the payment
      date, the Fund will issue new shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
      value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market
      price per Common Share on the payment date; or

(2)   If Common Shares are trading below net asset value (minus estimated
      brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of Common
      Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the Plan Agent will
      receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will purchase Common
      Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
      for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for
      the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
      purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the
      Plan Agent may exceed the market price on the payment date, resulting in
      the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had
      been paid in Common Shares issued by the Funds. The Plan Agent will use
      all dividends and distributions received in cash to purchase Common
      Shares in the open market on or shortly after the payment date, but in no
      event later than the ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest
      will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a certificate for
each whole share in your account under the Plan and you will receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan
Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax purposes. The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common Shares with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive distributions in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or
distributions in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open
market purchases.

Automatically reinvested dividends and distributions are taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Funds and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the
Funds reserve the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable
by the participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from
the Funds' transfer agent, PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence, Rhode Island
02940-3027, telephone number 1-800-331-1710.

CODE OF ETHICS PURSUANT TO SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

                               SEPTEMBER 16, 2003

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This Code of Ethics (this "Code") pursuant to Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been adopted by the registered investment
companies (each a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") listed on Exhibit A and
applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers" each of whom is
identified in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by a Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of
interest.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ANY ACTUAL OR APPARENT CONFLICTS
     OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the relevant Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of the Covered Officer's position with the relevant Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the relevant Fund and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions and procedures in the Investment Company Act of 1940
(including the regulations thereunder, the "1940 Act") and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (including the regulations thereunder, the "Investment
Advisers Act"). Indeed, conflicts of interest are endemic for certain registered
management investment companies and those conflicts are both substantially and
procedurally dealt with under the 1940 Act. For example, Covered Officers may
not engage in certain transactions with a Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of such Fund. The compliance program of each Fund and the
compliance programs of its investment advisers (including sub-advisers),
principal underwriter and administrator or sub-administrator (each a "Service

<PAGE>

Provider" and, collectively, the "Service Providers") are reasonably designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of many of those provisions,
although they are not designed to provide absolute assurance as to those
matters. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Fund and its Service Providers of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether for the Funds or
for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Service Providers
and the Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationships between the Funds and their Service
Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the relevant Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, other
applicable law and the relevant Fund's constitutional documents, such activities
will be deemed to have been handled ethically. Frequently, the 1940 Act
establishes, as a mechanism for dealing with conflicts, disclosure to and
approval by the Directors/Trustees of a Fund who are not "interested persons" of
such Fund under the 1940 Act. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes and that such service, by itself, does not give rise to a conflict of
interest.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not the subject of provisions of the 1940 Act and the Investment
Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest
under the Code, but Covered Officers should bear in mind that these examples are
not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
relevant Fund, unless the personal interest has been disclosed to and approved
by other officers of such Fund or such Fund's Board or a committee of such
Fund's Board that has no such personal interest.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the relevant
          Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of such Fund;

     o    cause the relevant Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
          the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit such Fund; or

     o    retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Funds or their Service Providers for reports of potential violations
          that are made in good faith.

     There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the President of the relevant Fund (or, with respect to activities
of the President, by the Chairman of the relevant Fund). These conflict of
interest situations are listed below:

<PAGE>

     o    service on the board of directors or governing board of a publicly
          traded entity;

     o    acceptance of any investment opportunity or of any material gift or
          gratuity from any person or entity that does business, or desires to
          do business, with the relevant Fund. For these purposes, material
          gifts do not include (i) gifts from a single giver so long as their
          aggregate annual value does not exceed the equivalent of $100.00 or
          (ii) attending business meals, business related conferences, sporting
          events and other entertainment events at the expense of a giver, so
          long as the expense is reasonable and both the Covered Person and the
          giver are present.(1)

     o    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any entities doing business with the relevant Fund,
          other than a Service Provider or an affiliate of a Service Provider.
          This restriction shall not apply to or otherwise limit the ownership
          of publicly traded securities so long as the Covered Person's
          ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the outstanding securities
          of the relevant class.

     o    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the relevant Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment with a Service Provider
          or its affiliate. This restriction shall not apply to or otherwise
          limit the ownership of publicly traded securities so long as the
          Covered Person's ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the
          particular class of security outstanding.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o    no Covered Officer should knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
          misrepresent, facts about the relevant Fund to others, whether within
          or outside such Fund, including to such Fund's Board and auditors, and
          to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and the Service Providers or with counsel to the Funds with the
          goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
          disclosure in the registration statements or periodic reports that the
          Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC (which, for sake of clarity,
          does not include any sales literature, omitting prospectuses, or
          "tombstone" advertising prepared by the relevant Fund's principal
          underwriter(s)); and

     o    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:


- --------
(1)    The $100.00 threshold was taken from the ADAMA Code of Ethics.

<PAGE>

     o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming
          a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the relevant Fund that he has
          received, read, and understands the Code;

     o    provide full and fair responses to all questions asked in any Trustee
          and Officer Questionnaire provided by the relevant Fund as well as
          with respect to any supplemental request for information; and

     o    notify the President of the relevant Fund promptly if he is convinced
          to a moral certainty that there has been a material violation of this
          Code (with respect to violations by a President, the Covered Officer
          shall report to the Chairman of the relevant Fund).

     The President of each Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by the President will be considered by the Chairman
of the relevant Fund.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     o    the President will take all appropriate action to investigate any
          potential material violations reported to him, which actions may
          include the use of internal or external counsel, accountants or other
          personnel;

     o    if, after such investigation, the President believes that no material
          violation has occurred, the President is not required to take any
          further action;

     o    any matter that the President believes is a material violation will be
          reported to the Committee;

     o    if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it
          will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
          consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
          appropriate modifications to applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of a Service Provider or its
          board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o    the Committee will be authorized to grant waivers, as it deems
          appropriate; and

     o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers govern or
purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are
subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their Service
Providers's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Service
Providers's more detailed compliance

<PAGE>

policies and procedures are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any material amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone except as permitted by the Board.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
