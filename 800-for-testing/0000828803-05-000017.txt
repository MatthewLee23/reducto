                                  Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                                  structure combines the specialized expertise
                                  of three world-class investment management
                                  groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE             Each of our portfolio management groups
                                  operates autonomously, relying on its own
                                  research and staying true to the unique
                                  investment disciplines that underlie its
                                  success.

                                  FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                                  recognized leader in fixed income investing
                                  and also brings expertise in growth- and
                                  value-style U.S. equity investing.

                                  TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton
                                  pioneered international investing and, in
                                  1954, launched what has become the industry's
                                  oldest global fund. Today, with offices in
                                  over 25 countries, Templeton offers investors
                                  a truly global perspective.

                                  MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series
                                  is dedicated to a unique style of value
                                  investing, searching aggressively for
                                  opportunity among what it believes are
                                  undervalued stocks, as well as arbitrage
                                  situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION              Because our management groups work
                                  independently and adhere to different
                                  investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and
                                  Mutual Series funds typically have distinct
                                  portfolios. That's why our funds can be used
                                  to build truly diversified allocation plans
                                  covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST         At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                                  consistently provide investors with
                                  exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the
                                  long term, as well as the reliable, accurate
                                  and personal service that has helped us become

in the past six months. It is designed to give you an understanding of several
factors considered before the Board approved the Fund's contract with the
Investment Manager. The disclosure is in the "Shareholder Information" section
beginning on page 39.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the period under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of 10.61% based on market price and 10.03% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Government Bond Index (GBI)
Global, which posted cumulative total returns of 6.16% in local currency terms
and 6.55% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period.(1) You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 8.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the Fund's fiscal year, global economic growth remained positive,
particularly in the U.S. and Asia. U.S. economic growth continued to be above
long-term averages, with gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 3.3% annualized
in the second quarter of 2005 compared with a year earlier.(2) Characteristic of
above-average growth, the labor market tightened, high capacity utilization
rates stimulated investment growth, consumption trends remained strong, and
signs of increased inflationary pressures solidified. Consequently, the Federal
Reserve Board increased the federal funds target rate 200 basis points (100
basis points equal one percentage point) to 3.50% during the reporting period.
Consistent with strong economic growth, and in particular solid consumption
trends, U.S. imports of foreign goods outpaced U.S. export growth, driving the
U.S. trade balance to a $58 billion monthly deficit level by July 2005.(3) While
higher oil prices negatively impacted the deficit, the underlying trade balance
(not including oil) also deteriorated, largely as a result of a widening trade
deficit with the Pacific Rim region. For example, by July the U.S. trade deficit
with the Pacific Rim increased 23% from a year earlier.(3) Furthermore, the U.S.
current account deficit reached a record 6.5% of GDP in second quarter 2005.(3)

As could be expected from the U.S. balance of payment figures, Asia's trade
dynamics remained favorable. Chinese exports rose 33% compared with a year
earlier, while Japan, South Korea and several other Asian countries generated
significant current account surpluses.(4) Strong balance of payment conditions,
in addition to less flexible currency strategies, particularly in China,
continued to facilitate Asia's foreign reserve accumulation. The buildup of
external imbalances, in addition to international political pressure, prompted
the Chinese government to revalue the yuan 2.1% and move from its U.S. dollar
peg to a managed-float exchange rate regime versus a basket of undisclosed
global currencies. The announcement resulted in a drop in the U.S. dollar
against the region's other major currencies. Malaysia's central bank also
announced that it would abandon its fixed exchange rate regime in favor of a
similar basket arrangement. While global demand for Asian products remained
favorable for the region's growth, there were also signs of a pick-up in
domestic growth drivers, particularly in Japan, Thailand and South Korea. In
China, increased personal consumption and strong domestic growth conditions
continued to benefit its regional trade partners through import demand.
Commodity exporters, such as Australia and New Zealand, also experienced
positive trade developments, benefiting their overall economic growth
conditions. Largely as a result, Australia's central bank raised interest rates
25 basis points to 5.50%, and New Zealand's central bank increased rates 75
basis points to 6.75%. In addition, the central bank of Thailand raised rates
125 basis points during the period due to higher inflationary pressures.

In contrast to robust growth in the U.S. and Asia, the 12-country euro zone's
economic activity was lackluster, driven by weak domestic demand. Euro-zone GDP
for second quarter 2005 grew just 1.1% compared with a year earlier, and growth
expectations declined during the period.(5) Inflation, however, generally
remained stable, and by period-end the European Central Bank had left interest
rates unchanged at 2.00% for the 27th consecutive month. Growth among other
(non-euro) European economies, on the other hand, was generally more dynamic. In
Norway, high oil prices benefited the business cycle, which is heavily dependent
on oil exports, while consumption and investment trends supported strengthening
GDP growth. This helped the country's economic growth outside the oil sector
rise 4.2% in first quarter 2005.(6) Although inflation rates remained low,
strong aggregate demand and rising capacity constraints prompted Norway's
central bank to raise interest rates. Another example of higher economic growth
in Europe outside the euro zone was Slovakia. Slovakia was on track to be the
first of the four largest central

European economies to adopt the euro, due in part to the success of its fiscal
reforms. Additionally, Slovakia continued to benefit from large-scale foreign
direct investment projects, job creation and high growth rates relative to the
euro zone. Positive foreign investment trends, tightening labor market
conditions and increased private consumption boosted Slovakian GDP growth to
5.1% annualized in second quarter 2005.(7)

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency rates
and credit risk.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

During the fiscal year, international yield curves generally flattened and local
bond markets performed well. The Fund's overall shorter duration positioning
relative to the JPM GBI Global Index worked against Fund performance in certain
bond markets, such as the U.S, where the U.S. subindex of the JPM GBI Global
rose 4.41%.(1) Outside the U.S., we continued to find opportunities to take
advantage of interest rate developments. For example, while Poland's medium-term
economic growth prospects remained favorable similar to other central European
Union (EU) countries, supported by improving trade dynamics, employment growth
and foreign investment trends, Poland experienced cyclical slowing in the first
half of 2005. Weaker-than-expected growth in first quarter 2005 combined with
rapid disinflation as price shocks from European Monetary Union (EMU) entry
faded, allowing Poland's central bank to reduce interest rates by 175 basis
points to 4.75%, which in turn supported bond market returns of 17.98% in local
currency terms.(1) Interest rate reductions in Sweden had a similar impact on
its local market returns. Sweden's economic

<PAGE>

growth lagged in the first half of 2005 given greater excess capacity,
particularly in the labor market, and greater export sensitivity to euro-zone
growth. Combined with low underlying inflationary pressures, Sweden's central
bank reduced the interest rate 50 basis points to 1.50%. The Swedish yield curve
shifted downward over the period and local bond markets rose 10.49%.(1)

CURRENCY STRATEGY

Given global economic imbalances between the U.S. and Asia, we reduced the
Fund's euro exposure and broadened the Fund's non-Japan Asian currency exposure,
while maintaining limited U.S. dollar exposure given worsening balance of
payment conditions. We undertook such moves seeking to position the Fund for
potential appreciation of Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar largely due
to greater flexibility in many Asian currency policies and implicitly less
appreciation pressure on the euro versus the U.S. dollar. We have already seen
some evidence of greater policy strides toward currency flexibility, notably in
China, where the yuan's recent revaluation indirectly benefited other currencies
in the region. Additionally, Asia's growth characteristics remained favorable
with rising domestic demand in second quarter 2005 and a large regional savings
pool, as indicated by a large stock of accumulated foreign reserves that could
further promote domestic growth.

Within Asia, the Fund continued to hold a basket of non-Japan Asian currencies
while avoiding exposure to the Japanese yen. This allocation generally
outperformed the yen over the Fund's fiscal year, benefiting relative
performance. For example, the South Korean won rose 10.70% against the U.S.
dollar, bringing bond market returns in U.S. dollar terms to 13.26% according to
the HSBC Asian Local Bond Index (ALBI).(8) This contrasted to the Japanese bond
market, which rose 1.09% in U.S. dollar terms over the period along with 1.25%
yen depreciation against the U.S. dollar.(1) Fund positioning in Asian
currencies over the 12-month period helped offset relatively mixed currency
performance in Europe. For example, although the euro appreciated 1.20% against
the U.S. dollar, it unwound significant gains made in the first half of the
Fund's fiscal year. This unwinding was partly reflective of tepid western
European growth conditions, but also political developments regarding failed

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also purchased investment-grade and sub-investment grade sovereign debt
that typically compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher yields
relative to U.S. and European benchmark treasury curves. Despite rising
short-term U.S. interest rates, U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt
continued to generate strong returns, rising 13.97% over the period, as measured
by the JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG).(9) Sovereign interest
rate spreads narrowed from 425 basis points greater than the U.S. Treasury
market on August 31, 2004, to 281 basis points at period-end. Regionally, Latin
American sovereign debt rose 14.62%, central and eastern Europe 16.54% and Asia
8.61%.(1) Euro-denominated markets also rose over the 12-month period, gaining
11.54% in euro terms as measured by the JPM Euro EMBIG.(10)

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.


                                                              Annual Report | 19

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income
and net realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation. Foreign
taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax regulations and rates that exist in
the foreign markets in which the Fund invests.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These differences may be permanent or temporary.
Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their
tax character. These reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the
results of operations. Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they will
reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-index bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases in
the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by amounts
corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments, including
adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest income.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expense during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through August 31, 2005, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the year ended August 31, 2005,
there were no share repurchases.


                                                              Annual Report | 21

5. INCOME TAXES

At August 31, 2005, the Fund had tax basis capital losses which may be carried
over to offset future capital gains, if any. During the year ended August 31,
2005, the Fund utilized $7,625,842 of capital loss carryforwards. At August 31,

 2010 .................................................       27,371,582
 2011 .................................................        4,209,282
                                                             -----------
                                                             $48,775,389
                                                             ===========

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended August 31, 2005
and 2004, was as follows:

                                              --------------------------
                                                  2005           2004
                                              --------------------------
Distributions paid from - ordinary income     $81,190,215    $70,472,145

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, and bond discounts
and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, and bond discounts and premiums.

At August 31, 2005, the cost of investments, net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation), and undistributed ordinary income for income tax purposes were
as follows:

Cost of investments ..................................    $ 1,044,216,030
                                                          ===============

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

<PAGE>

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 16.46% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), relating to certain
practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and
marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used in this section,
together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and
employees of the Company, provided documents and information in response to
subpoenas and/or requests for documents, information and/or testimony. Beginning
in August 2004, the Company entered into settlements with certain of the
regulators and a governmental entity investigating the mutual fund industry
practices noted above. The Company believes that settlement of each of the
matters is in the best interest of the Company and shareholders of the Franklin,
Templeton, and Mutual Series mutual funds (the "funds").

Two of the settlement agreements, those with the SEC and the CAGO concerning
marketing support payments, provide that the distribution of settlement monies
are to be made to the relevant funds, not to individual shareholders. The CAGO
has approved the distribution plan

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS (CONTINUED)

pertaining to the distribution of the monies owed under the CAGO settlement
agreement and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that settlement,
the monies were disbursed to the participating funds. The Fund did not
participate in the CAGO settlement. The SEC has not yet approved the
distribution plan pertaining to the SEC settlement. When approved, disbursements
of settlement monies under the SEC's settlement will be made promptly in
accordance with the terms and conditions of that order.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On April 12, 2005, the Attorney General of West Virginia filed a complaint in
the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia against a number of
companies engaged in the mutual fund industry, including Franklin Resources,
Inc. and its subsidiary, Franklin Advisers, Inc., and certain other parties
alleging violations of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act and
seeking, among other things, civil penalties and attorneys' fees and costs.
Defendants have since removed the matter to the United States District Court for
the Northern District of West Virginia. To the extent applicable to the Company,
the complaint arises from activity that occurred in 2001 and duplicates, in
whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the February 4, 2004 Massachusetts
Administrative Complaint concerning one instance of market timing (the
"Administrative Complaint") and the SEC's findings regarding market timing in
its August 2, 2004 Order (the "SEC Order"), both of which matters were
previously reported.

The Company, in addition to certain funds, and certain current and former
officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits in
different courts alleging violations of various federal securities and state
laws and seeking, among other relief, monetary damages, restitution, removal of
fund trustees, directors, advisers, administrators, and distributors, rescission
of management contracts and 12b-1 plans, and/or attorneys' fees and costs.
Specifically, the lawsuits claim breach of duty with respect to alleged
arrangements to permit market timing and/or late trading activity, or breach of
duty with respect to the valuation of the portfolio securities of certain
Templeton funds managed by Franklin Resources, Inc. subsidiaries, allegedly
resulting in market timing activity. The majority of these lawsuits duplicate,
in whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the Administrative Complaint
and the SEC's findings regarding market timing in the SEC Order. The lawsuits
are styled as class actions, or derivative actions on behalf of either the named
funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.


                                                              Annual Report | 25

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

The Company, in addition to certain funds, and certain current and former
officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits alleging
violations of various securities laws and pendent state law claims relating to
the disclosure of marketing support payments and/or payment of allegedly
excessive commissions and/or advisory or distribution fees, and seeking, among
other relief, monetary damages, restitution, rescission of advisory contracts,
including recovery of all fees paid pursuant to those contracts, an accounting
of all monies paid to the named advisers, declaratory relief, injunctive relief,
and/or attorneys' fees and costs. These lawsuits are styled as class actions or
derivative actions brought on behalf of the named funds.

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the lawsuits described above are without merit and intend to defend against them
vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of
these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. Public trust and confidence are critical to the Company's business and
any material loss of investor and/or client confidence could result in a
significant decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have
an adverse effect on future financial results. If it is determined that the
Company bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that
caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its
shareholders whole, as appropriate. The Company is committed to taking all
appropriate actions to protect the interests of its funds' shareholders.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Global Income Fund (the
"Fund") at August 31, 2005, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at August
31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

At August 31, 2005, more than 50% of the Templeton Global Income Fund's total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from dividends paid to the Fund on these
investments. As shown in the table below, the Fund designates to shareholders
the foreign source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the
Internal Revenue Code. This designation will allow shareholders of record on
August 17, 2005, to treat their proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the
Fund as having been paid directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these
amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund
distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by
the Fund, to shareholders of record.

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit or deduction (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a
minimum of 16 days during the 30-day period beginning 15 days before the
ex-dividend date of the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate).

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends without adjustment for the lower U.S.
tax rates.

Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. If you have foreign source qualified
dividends, you may be required to make certain adjustments to those amounts
before taking them into account on line 1 of Form 1116. However, you may qualify
for an adjustment exception. Please see the instructions to Form 1116 for more
information.

In January 2006, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2005. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been reduced to take into account the tax rate differential on foreign source
qualified dividend income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax
advisors for information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2005
individual income tax returns.

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to Mellon
Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a
maximum of $5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her
account. These payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon
Bank, N.A." and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh,
PA 15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator
shall apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share
of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fees for a sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O.
Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds, less a
service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per share, to the
participant.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT

At a meeting held May 11, 2005, the Board of Trustees ("Board"), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment advisory contract for the Fund. In reaching this decision, the Board
took into account information furnished throughout the year at regular Board
meetings, as well as information prepared specifically in connection with the
annual renewal review process. Information furnished and discussed throughout
the year included reports on the Fund, the share price premium or discount to
net asset value, the results of investment performance and related financial
information for the Fund, as well as periodic reports on legal, compliance,
pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and other services provided by the
Investment Manager ("Manager") and its affiliates. Information furnished
specifically in connection with the renewal process included a report prepared
by Lipper Financial Services ("Lipper"), an independent organization, as well as
a Fund profitability analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper report
compared the Fund's investment performance and expenses with those of other
funds deemed comparable to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund
profitability analysis report discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton
Investments from its overall U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual
fund-by-fund basis. Included with such profitability analysis report was
information on a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and other
accounts they manage, as well as information on management fees charged by the
Manager including management's explanation of differences where relevant, and a
three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any increase in expense
ratios. Additional information accompanying such report was a memorandum
prepared by management describing enhancements to the services provided to the
Fund by the Franklin Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum
relating to economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment advisory contract for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment advisory contract was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses the primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT (CONTINUED)

Board, and the accuracy of net asset value calculations. Favorable consideration
was given to management's efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up
systems and recovery procedures to function in the event of a natural disaster,
it being noted by the Board that such systems and procedures had functioned
smoothly during the hurricanes and blackout experienced last year in Florida.
Other factors taken into account by the Board were the Manager's best execution
trading policies, as well as the compliance procedures and qualifications of the
Chief Compliance Officer established in accordance with recently adopted SEC
requirements. Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's
portfolio management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of the level of a portfolio manager's bonus
compensation was the relative investment performance of the funds he or she
managed so as to be aligned with the interest of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the contract renewals.
The Lipper report for the Fund showed its investment performance in respect to
both a closed-end fund group, as well as an open-end performance universe for
the one-year period ended February 28, 2005, as well as the previous ten years
ended that date. Such report considered the Fund's income return and total
return on a net asset basis without regard to market discounts or premiums in
order to accurately reflect investment performance. The closed-end fund group
selected by Lipper consisted of the Fund and two other non-leveraged closed-end
global income funds. The Lipper report showed that the Fund's income return for
the one-year period and each of the previous three-, five- and ten-year periods
on an annualized basis was the lowest of such group, while its total return in
each case was the highest of such group for each of the one-, three- and
five-year periods, and in the middle for the ten-year period. The open-end
performance universe consisted of the Fund and all open-end retail and
institutional global income funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report
showed the Fund's income return and total return to each be in the highest
quintile of such performance universe for the one-year period and in the highest
or second highest quintile of such universe for each of the previous three-,
five- and ten-year periods on an annualized basis. The Board was satisfied with
such comparative performance.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fee and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a
Lipper-selected expense group consisting of the Fund and the two other
closed-end funds comprising the closed-end fund group referred to in the
discussion of investment performance. Prior to making such comparison, the Board
relied upon a survey showing that the scope of management advisory services
covered under the Fund's investment advisory contract was similar to those
provided by fund

managers to other fund groups which would be used as a basis of comparison in
the Lipper report. In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was given to the
Fund's management fee in comparison with the effective management fee that would
have been charged by the other two funds within the Lipper expense group
assuming they were the same size as the Fund, as well as the actual total
expenses of the Fund in comparison with those of the other two funds. The Lipper
effective management fee analysis considers administrative fees to be part of
management fees and the results of such expense comparison showed both the
Fund's effective management fee rate and total actual expenses to be the lowest
of such group. The Board was satisfied with the Fund's comparative management
fee and expenses.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
each of the individual funds. The Board also considered the extent to which the
Manager and its affiliates might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations,
as well as potential benefits resulting from allocation of fund brokerage and
the use of "soft" commission dollars to pay for research. Specific attention was
given to the methodology followed in allocating costs to the Fund, it being
recognized that allocation methodologies are inherently subjective and various
allocation methodologies may each be reasonable while producing different
results. In this respect, the Board noted that the cost allocation methodology
was consistent with that followed in profitability report presentations made in
prior years and that it had engaged on a biennial basis the Fund's independent
accountants to perform certain procedures specified by the Board solely for its
purpose and use. It was also noted that legal costs and payments incurred by
Franklin Templeton Investments in resolving various legal proceedings arising
from its U.S. fund operations had not been allocated to the Fund for purposes of
determining profitability. Included in the analysis were the revenue and related
costs involved in managing the Fund, as well as its relative contribution to the
profitability of the Manager's parent. In reviewing and discussing such
analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that costs incurred in
establishing the infrastructure necessary to the type of fund operations
conducted by the Manager and its corporate affiliates may not be fully reflected
in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its profitability, as well
as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain extent, reflected
operational cost savings and efficiencies initiated by management. In addition,
the Board considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the
Manager's parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers
broken down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of
distribution expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses.
Based upon their consideration of all these factors, the Board determined that
the level of profits realized by the Manager under its investment advisory
contract with the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature, quality and
extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders. In this respect, the Board
noted that as a result of breakpoints established during the previous year, the
Fund was charged a management advisory fee and administrative fee at the
combined rate of 0.70% on its first $200 million of net assets; 0.635% on the
next $500 million of net assets; 0.60% on the next $300 million of net assets;
and 0.58% on the next $4 billion of net assets with decreasing breakpoints
continuing through the $20 billion net asset level. The Fund's asset size at
fiscal year-end was approximately $1.25 billion and the Board believed that to
the extent economies of scale may be realized by the Manager and its affiliates,
that such fee schedule provides a sharing of benefits with the Fund and its
shareholders.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

The Fund has established Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures ("Policies") that
the Fund uses to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities.

at franklintempleton.com and posted on the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission's website at sec.gov and reflect the most recent 12-month period

Exchange Commission for the first and third quarters for each fiscal year on

committee responsibilities, as contemplated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, to management;  subject, in the case of (ii) through (iv), to any waivers,
exceptions or exemptions that may be available under applicable law or rules.

(e) (2) None of the services provided to the registrant described in paragraphs
(b)-(d) of Item 4 were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of regulation S-X.

(f) No disclosures are required by this Item 4(f).

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees paid to the principal accountant for services
rendered by the principal accountant to the registrant and the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant were $19,591 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005 and $148,579
for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2004.

(h) The registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Limited in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in  analyzing  proxies,  the manager  subscribes  to  Institutional
Shareholder  Services (ISS), an  unaffiliated  third party corporate  governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote  recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third  party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses  and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  ISS'  and/or  Glass  Lewis'  analyses  are  thoroughly   reviewed  and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations   from  ISS,  Glass  Lewis  or  any  other  third  party  to  be
determinative  of the  manager's  ultimate  decision.  The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers,  directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose  interests  conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders.  All conflicts are resolved
in the  interests of the  manager's  clients.  In  situations  where the manager
perceives  a material  conflict  of  interest,  the manager  may:  disclose  the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees;  defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees,  ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another  independent
third party provider of proxy services;  or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF  AUDITORS  OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  In light of several  high
profile  accounting  scandals,  the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance  of  auditors.  On a  case-by-case  basis,  the manager will examine
proposals  relating to non-audit  relationships  and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis,  proposals to rotate auditors,  and
will  vote  against  the  ratification  of  auditors  when  there is  clear  and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders'  long-term interests.  The manager
evaluates  plans on a  case-by-case  basis by  considering  several  factors  to
determine   whether  the  plan  is  fair  and  reasonable,   including  the  ISS
quantitative  model  utilized  to assess  such  plans  and/or  the  Glass  Lewis
evaluation of the plans.  The manager will generally  oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively  dilutive,  and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater  options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support  employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(b) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Dated July 2004

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;



- -----------------------------
1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.







     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.


- -----------------

3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.






     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.


- ---------------------

5 See Part X.






IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet

undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the

such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
