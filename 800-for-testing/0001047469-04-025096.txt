EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS as of May 31, 2004

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]
Thomas J. Fetter
President

The municipal bond market consists of a broad array of bond issues, with widely
varying features and performance characteristics that may make them appropriate
for a specific investment scenario. In this edition of our continuing
educational series, we will feature zero coupon bonds - a variety of bond that
has seen increasing use by investors over the past 20 years - and discuss why
they can provide flexibility in managing a bond portfolio.

THE 1980'S BROUGHT NEW VARIATIONS TO THE BOND MARKET...

Any discussion of zero coupon bonds should start with the term "coupon."
Traditionally, bonds were issued in certificate form, with interest coupons
attached, which the owner would clip and present for payment. The coupon rate
indicates the rate of annual interest the issuer pays to the bondholder. For
example, a $1,000 bond with a 5% coupon makes two semiannual interest payments
of $25 each.

Today, most bonds are issued as "book-entry bonds," registered in the owner's
name, but not delivered in certificate form. That change has not only replaced
the antiquated coupon-clipping system, but also encouraged the development of
new types of bonds - including zero coupon bonds, introduced in 1982.

ZERO-COUPONS: NO INTEREST PAYMENTS, BUT A PREDICTABLE LUMP-SUM PAYMENT AT
MATURITY...

Zero coupon bonds do not have coupons attached and do not make regular interest
payments. Instead, they are issued at a discount, usually well below par, or
face value. As with coupon bonds, the bondholder receives face value if the bond
is held to its maturity date. Over time - from its issuance to its maturity -
zero coupon bonds accrete to par, meaning that their price appreciates over time
to reflect the accrual of "imputed" compound interest. An investor holding a
zero coupon bond to maturity receives a lump sum payment from the issuer for
face value reflecting the initial investment plus interest that has accrued.
Although zero coupon bonds do not pay any interest until they mature, the
accrual of "imputed" compound interest is recognized currently.

ZERO COUPON BONDS PROVIDE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY...

For a portfolio manager, zero coupons can play a useful strategic role. Like
other bonds, zero coupon bond prices are affected by market conditions, changes
in an issuer's underlying fundamentals and fluctuations in interest rates.
Because they pay no coupon or periodic interest payments, they typically display
more price sensitivity than other bonds in response to changes in interest
rates. Therefore, zero coupon bonds can provide more appreciation potential in a
declining interest rate environment. Of course, zero coupons display increased
DOWNSIDE volatility in the event of an INCREASE in interest rates.

Some zero coupon bonds start out as coupon-bearing bonds, which are then
deposited with a trustee and subsequently "stripped" of their coupons. New
securities are then created from principal and coupon payments. This allows an
investor to choose a maturity to match the time when funds will be needed.
Moreover, because of their many permutations, zero coupon bonds can help balance
income-oriented bonds with performance-oriented zero coupons, providing more
versatility in managing a municipal portfolio.

TAX-EXEMPT BONDS CONTINUE TO OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ISSUERS AND INVESTORS
ALIKE...

Throughout its history, the municipal market has helped finance public projects
and has pioneered new financing options for issuers - such as zero coupon bonds
- - that offer new opportunities for investors. We at Eaton Vance remain confident
that the market will continue to offer more such opportunities and we emphasize
our continued commitment to this exciting market.

                                                    Sincerely,

                                                    /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS as of May 31, 2004

MARKET RECAP

The U.S. economy strengthened significantly in the six months ended May 31,
2004. Despite sometimes unsettling news from Iraq, consumers continued to spend,
while businesses began to renew capital spending programs. Not surprisingly,
amid a strengthening economy and rising inflation, the bond markets gave back
some of their gains from the previous year.

THE CONSTRUCTION AND BUSINESS SERVICE SECTORS WERE AMONG THE LEADERS IN JOB
GROWTH...

The nation's Gross Domestic Product grew by 3.9% in the first quarter of 2004,
following a 4.1% rise in the fourth quarter of 2003. New momentum was apparent
across the entire economy. Retail sales improved markedly, as consumers gained
more confidence from an improving job outlook. Manufacturing activity gained
strength, with new orders and industrial production significantly stronger than
in 2003. Demand for advanced technology products picked up, as businesses made
purchases long-delayed by prior doubts about the strength of the recovery.

Consistent with an improving economy, demand rose for key industrial components,
such as metals, energy and chemicals, while factories operated at higher
capacity rates. The residential construction sector continued to create jobs,
despite a rise in mortgage rates in recent months. However, the commercial
segment of the real estate market remained depressed. Conditions in the
agricultural sector generally improved, as farmers received higher prices for
many products.

HAVING LAGGED THE INITIAL UPTURN, JOB GROWTH HAS RETURNED IN RECENT MONTHS...

Rising job growth was among the key developments during the six months ended May
31, 2004. While monthly labor data can be quite volatile, recent trends suggest
a favorable turn in the labor market. The nation's unemployment rate was 5.6% in
May 2004, down from 6.1% a year earlier. The economy produced jobs in
technology, apparel, finance, construction, retail and manufacturing.

INTEREST RATES MOVED HIGHER, AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE PROMISED TO BATTLE
INFLATION...

Inflation re-emerged as a concern to investors and the Federal Reserve.
Record-high oil prices pushed the price of gasoline above $2 a gallon, while
food costs edged higher, together with those of many raw materials used in
industrial processes. The Federal Reserve has maintained a close watch on
employment and price data. On June 30, 2004, after having held its Federal Funds
rate - a key short-term interest rate barometer - at 1.00% through the first
half of the year, the Federal Reserve raised that benchmark to 1.25%, the first
such rate hike since May 2000.

The municipal bond market performed generally in line with the Treasury market
during the six-month period ended May 31, 2004. Ten-year Treasury bond yields -
which were around 4.37% at November 30, 2003 - rose to 4.68% by May 31, 2004,
while 10-year municipal yields rose from 3.81% to 4.21%. Amid increasing signs
of inflation and an upward trend in interest rates, the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index retreated slightly during the six months ended May 31,
2004, posting a total return of -0.22%.*

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - California generated increased economic activity in the first half of 2004,
  reflecting the national recovery. Residential construction has produced strong
  job growth, while the information sector has also showed renewed momentum. The
  state's May 2004 jobless rate was 6.2%, down 6.8% from a year ago.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) were the Trust's largest sector weighting
  at May 31, 2004. Insured* GOs provided excellent quality during a period in
  which the still-evolving economic recovery produced a mixed revenue picture
  for some industrial issuers.

- - Special tax revenue bonds were major investments of the Trust and financed a
  wide variety of projects. The Trust's investments included issues that
  financed water infrastructure, transportation projects and public facilities
  throughout the state.

- - The Trust remained very selective within the hospital sector. Management
  focused its investments on acute care institutions with good market share, as
  well as facilities with in-demand health care niches, such as cardiac, cancer
  or dialysis specialties.

- - Management continued to adjust the Trust's coupon structure and call
  protection, as market conditions warranted. Coupon structure and call
  protection can have a significant influence on the Trust's performance
  characteristics, especially in a changing interest rate environment.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - Florida employment growth during the period was among the fastest in the
  nation. The state's pivotal tourism industry continued to benefit from the
  weak U.S. dollar, while low interest rates prompted continued growth in the
  residential real estate market. The state's jobless rate was 4.5% in May 2004,
  down from 5.3% a year ago.

- - Insured* water and sewer issues were the Trust's largest weighting at May 31,
  2004. Population growth in areas such as Tampa and St. Petersburg has brought
  more construction and the need for water improvements, a trend that has
  resulted in additional opportunities within this sector.

- - Insured* transportation bonds were large investments of the Trust.
  Transportation-related bonds represent a significant portion of Florida's
  municipal issuance and have increased in recent years as the state faces
  growing infrastructure financing needs. The Trust's holdings included issues
  for airports, turnpikes, port facilities and expressways.

- - Insured* special tax revenue bonds provided an attractive income stream. These
  issues provide Florida communities flexibility in financing a wide variety of
  public initiatives and infrastructure-related projects.

- - Management continued to adjust the Trust's coupon structure and call
  protection, as market conditions warranted. Coupon structure and call
  protection can have a significant influence on the Trust's performance
  characteristics, especially in a changing interest rate environment.

Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - Recovering from losses in the past two years, the Massachusetts economy gained
  ground in the first half of 2004. Finance and technology rebounded, while
  housing created additional jobs in the construction sector. The Commonwealth's
  May 2004 jobless rate was 5.2%, lower than the national rate, and below the
  5.8% rate of a year ago.

- - Insured* and uninsured education bonds were among the Trust's largest
  weightings at May 31, 2004. Education bonds constitute a significant portion
  of Massachusetts tax-exempt issuance. The Trust's investments included some of
  the Commonwealth's most respected colleges and preparatory schools.

- - As elsewhere in the nation, the Massachusetts hospital industry faces cost and
  reimbursement pressures. Hospital issues constituted significant investments
  of the Trust, with the focus on health and education facility authority issues
  that financed the construction and improvement of acute care facilities.

- - The Trust increased its exposure to insured* Commonwealth general obligation
  (GOs) bonds during the period. With increasing signs of a statewide economic
  recovery, administration estimates of sales tax and income tax receipts have
  been revised upward.

- - With a rising trend in interest rates, the Trust made adjustments in coupon
  structure, in part, by selling zero coupon issues into strong retail demand.
  Management also pared its holdings of alternative minimum tax (AMT) bonds,
  which have been under pressure due to the widening impact of the AMT.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - Michigan's job picture brightened significantly in the first half of 2004, as
  the beleaguered manufacturing sector was boosted by rising orders for durable
  goods and strong vehicle sales. Conditions also improved in trade,
  transportation and home building. The state's May 2004 jobless rate fell to
  6.5%, down from last year's 7.2% rate.

- - The Trust remained selective within the hospital sector, its largest sector
  weighting at May 31, 2004. With the industry facing pressure to contain costs,
  the Trust focused on institutions management believes have superior
  management, sound cost structures and highly marketable health care
  specialties.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) and general obligations were large
  investments for the Trust. Insured* GOs afforded excellent quality, while
  uninsured issues provided an exposure to the state turnaround through
  investments in local school district bonds.

- - Industrial development bonds constituted a significant investment for the
  Trust and another link to the economic recovery. The Trust's investments
  included economically sensitive issues for paper producers, airlines and the
  state's key automobile manufacturing sector.

- - Management continued to adjust coupon structure and call protection to address
  changing market conditions. Coupon structure and call protection can have a
  significant influence on the Trust's responsiveness to interest rate
  fluctuations.

EATON VANCE NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST as of May 31, 2004

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

[PHOTO OF ROBERT B. MACINTOSH]
Robert B. MacIntosh
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - New Jersey's job growth has exceeded the nation in the past year and continued
  to gather strength in 2004. Growth was particularly strong in education,
  health services, retail trade, government and professional and business
  services. The state's May 2004 jobless rate was 4.9%, lower than the national
  rate and well below the 5.9% rate of a year ago.

- - Hospital bonds represented the Trust's largest sector weighting at May 31,
  2004. Management focused on institutions prominent in their urban markets or
  well-positioned in suburban markets. We believe these facilities may be
  somewhat less vulnerable to the competitive pressures facing the hospital
  industry.

- - Insured* transportation bonds were among the Trust's largest investments.
  These issues financed upgrades needed for New Jersey's transportation matrix
  and represented a range of projects that included port authorities, turnpikes
  and JFK International Terminal.

- - Insured* general obligation bonds (GOs) represented a large investment for the
  Trust. Insured* GOs represented quality and a dependable revenue stream. With
  the economic recovery still in its early stages, insured* issues are an
  attractive alternative to GOs of communities whose local economies have not
  yet rebounded.

- - With this cycle's pre-refundings largely completed, the New Jersey tax-exempt
  market was characterized by very little new supply. Management therefore took
  advantage of new Puerto Rico issues to provide added diversification and
  adjust the Trust's coupon structure.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - The New York economy, which has lagged the national economy in recent years,
  showed signs of renewal in the first half of 2004. Employment growth has
  improved in recent months as key industries, such as finance and business
  services, have added workers. The state's May 2004 jobless rate was 5.8%, down
  from 6.3% a year ago.

- - Hospital bonds represented the Trust's largest sector weighting at May 31,
  2004. Investments represented a diverse array of hospitals, with an emphasis
  on institutions management believes have good cost structures, good market
  shares and health care specialities.

- - Insured* transportation bonds constituted a significant investment for the
  Trust. Investments included bonds for New York City's bridge and tunnel
  authority, as well as several issues for local and county airport authorities.

- - In a still-evolving recovery, management maintained an exposure to public
  purpose bonds, whose revenues are less economically-driven. The Trust had
  large investments in electric utility bonds, whose revenues are derived from
  customer's recurring utility payments.

- - Management continued its efforts to fine-tune coupon structure and improve
  call protection. These adjustments were part of an ongoing commitment to seek
  to protect against untimely calls and help improve the overall performance
  characteristics of the Trust.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - The Ohio economy gained strong momentum in the first half of 2004. The
  manufacturing sector saw broad-based increases in production, a marked
  improvement from 2003. Retailing benefited from strong consumer demand and
  residential construction neared last year's record pace. The state's May 2004
  jobless rate was 5.6%, down from 6.1% a year ago.

- - Hospital bonds constituted the Trust's largest sector weighting at May 31,
  2004. Amid strict Medicare reimbursement policies and continuing pressures on
  hospitals to pare costs, management emphasized facilities we believe have
  sound financial structures and good competitive positions within their
  respective markets.

- - Industrial development revenue bonds (IDRs) provided the Trust above-average
  income while financing commercial initiatives. In an economic recovery, the
  Trust's investments included auto manufacturers, airlines and air freight
  operators - areas that are likely to benefit from expanding economic activity.

- - Insured* general obligations (GO) played a prominent role in the Trust. In a
  market characterized by historically narrow spreads, insured* GOs were
  attractive and were a key to maintaining the Trust's high average credit
  rating.

- - Management adjusted the Trust's coupon structure as market conditions
  warranted. Management also continued to update call protection, eliminating
  issues with unfavorable call features in favor of bonds with longer-dated call
  provisions.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

- - Pennsylvania's economy improved in early 2004, with manufacturing continuing
  its recovery. The education and health services sectors remained the state's
  strongest job generators, benefiting from recent demographic trends and a
  large investment in biotechnology. The state's May 2004 jobless rate was 5.1%,
  down from 5.6% a year ago.

- - Insured* education bonds were the Trust's largest sector weighting at May 31,
  2004. These investments provided good quality from well-regarded issuers and
  included issues from private colleges, the state university system and
  vocational institutions.

- - Insured* general obligation bonds were major investments for the Trust.
  Insured* school district GOs are often valued by investors for their quality
  and insulation from the economic sensitivity that generally characterizes
  industrial issuers.

- - Insured* water and sewer bonds were a significant commitment for the Trust.
  These bonds finance projects for essential services. Backed by generally
  non-discretionary customer payments, they enjoy a very reliable revenue
  stream.

- - The Trust continued to emphasize diversification. In addition to diversifying
  according to issuer, sector and insurer, management had a balanced coupon
  allocation. Management also emphasized good call protection, which remains a
  strategic priority.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.012, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.012, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.36% to 7.44%, and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.68% to
     4.73%. Per share data and ratios for the period prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.002, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.002, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.60% to 7.61%, and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.81% to
     4.82%. Per share data and ratios for the period prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.003, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.003, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.78% to 7.80% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.87% to
     4.88%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.002, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.002, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.62% to 7.64% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.83% to
     4.84%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
     Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.005, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.005, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.80% to 7.84% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.88% to
     4.91%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
     30, 1999.

(4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(6)  Annualized.

(7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS as of May 31, 2004

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance California Municipal Income Trust (California Trust), Eaton Vance
   Florida Municipal Income Trust (Florida Trust), Eaton Vance Massachusetts
   Municipal Income Trust (Massachusetts Trust), Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal
   Income Trust (Michigan Trust), Eaton Vance New Jersey Municipal Income Trust
   (New Jersey Trust), Eaton Vance New York Municipal Income Trust (New York
   Trust), Eaton Vance Ohio Municipal Income Trust (Ohio Trust), and Eaton Vance
   Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (Pennsylvania Trust), (individually
   referred to as the Trust or collectively the Trusts) are registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end
   management investment companies. The Trusts were organized under the laws of
   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust
   dated December 10, 1998. Each Trust's investment objective is to provide
   current income exempt from regular federal income taxes and taxes in its
   specified state. Each Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing
   primarily in investment grade municipal obligations issued by its specified
   state.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by each Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Taxable obligations, if any, for
   which price quotations are readily available are normally valued at the mean
   between the latest bid and asked prices. Futures contracts and options on
   futures contracts listed on commodity exchanges are valued at closing
   settlement prices. Over-the-counter options on futures contracts are normally
   valued at the mean between the latest bid and asked prices. Short-term
   obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
   which approximates value. Investments for which valuations or market
   quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value using methods
   determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

   B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

   D FEDERAL TAXES -- Each Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of
   the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable, if any, and
   tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore,
   no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At November 30,
   2003, the Trusts, for federal income tax purposes, had capital loss
   carryovers which will reduce taxable income arising from future net realized
   gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
   Code, and thus will reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders
   which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trusts of any liability for
   federal income or excise tax. The amounts and expiration dates of the capital
   loss carryovers of each Trust are as follows:

   In addition, each Trust intends to satisfy conditions which will enable it to
   designate distributions from the interest income generated by its investments
   in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal income taxes
   when received by each Trust, as exempt-interest dividends. The portion of
   such interest, if any, earned on private activity bonds issued after
   August 7, 1986, may be considered a tax preference item for investors.

   E FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, a Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by a Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by a Trust. A Trust's investment
   in financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against
   anticipated future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should
   interest rates move unexpectedly, a Trust may not achieve the anticipated
   benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   F OPTIONS ON FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the purchase of a put option
   on a financial futures contract by a Trust, the premium paid is recorded as
   an investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
   option expires, a Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the
   option. When a Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, a Trust will
   realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the
   closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option.
   When a Trust exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk
   associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium originally
   paid.

   G USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   H INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under each Trust's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to each Trust and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for the obligations
   of each Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, each Trust
   enters into agreements with service providers that may contain
   indemnification clauses. Each Trust's maximum exposure under these
   arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
   against each Trust that have not yet occurred.

   I EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trusts. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT
   receives a fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average
   daily cash balances each Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit
   balances used to reduce the Trusts' custodian fees are reported as a
   reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.

   J INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- The interim financial statements relating
   to May 31, 2004 and for the six months then ended have not been audited by
   independent certified public accountants, but in the opinion of the Trusts'
   management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   Each Trust issued Auction Preferred Shares on March 1, 1999 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded
   as a reduction of capital of the common shares of each Trust. Dividends on
   the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
   at the offering of each Trust's APS and have been reset every seven days
   thereafter by an auction.

   Auction Preferred Shares issued and outstanding as of May 31, 2004 and
   dividend rate ranges for the six months ended May 31, 2004 are as indicated
   below:

   The APS are redeemable at the option of each Trust at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if any Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the Common Shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each Trust is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in each
   Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each Trust pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auction.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   Each Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions of any
   realized capital gains, if any, are made at least annually. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for Auction
   Preferred Shares on May 31, 2004 are listed below. For the six months ended
   May 31, 2004, the amount of dividends each Trust paid to Auction Preferred
   shareholders and average APS dividend rates for such period were as follows:

</Table>

   The Trusts distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid-in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.70% of each
   Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to each
   Trust. Except for Trustees of each Trust who are not members of EVM's
   organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services
   to each Trust out of such investment adviser fee. For the six months ended
   May 31, 2004, the fee was equivalent to 0.70% (annualized) of each Trust's
   average weekly gross assets and amounted to $592,171, $354,279, $218,235,
   $172,776, $375,279, $451,800, $230,603, and $221,001, for California Trust,
   Florida Trust, Massachusetts Trust, Michigan Trust, New Jersey Trust,
   New York Trust, Ohio Trust and Pennsylvania Trust, respectively. EVM also
   serves as the administrator of each Trust. An administration fee, computed at
   the annual rate of 0.20% of the average weekly gross assets of each Trust is
   paid to EVM for administering business affairs of each Trust. For the six
   months ended May 31, 2004, the administrative fee amounted to $169,192, $101,
   222, $62,353 $49,365, $107,223, $129,086, $65,887, and $63,143, for
   California Trust, Florida Trust, Massachusetts Trust, Michigan Trust,
   New Jersey Trust, New York Trust, Ohio Trust and Pennsylvania Trust,
   respectively.

   Certain officers and one Trustee of each Trust are officers of the above
   organization.

   During the six months ended May 31, 2004, New Jersey Trust engaged in a
   purchase transaction in the amount of $596,640 with a Portfolio which
   utilizes Boston Management and Research, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVM, as
   an investment adviser. This purchase transaction complied with Rule 17a-7
   under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   Each Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment a Trust has
   in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily
   represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the
   risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related
   and offsetting transactions are considered.

   A summary of obligations under these financial instruments at May 31, 2004 is
   as follows:

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc., at
1-800-331-1710.

APPLICATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

This form is for shareholders who hold their common shares in their own names.

firm, bank, or nominee is unable to participate on your behalf, you should
request that your common shares be re-registered in your own name which will
enable your participation in the Plan.

I may terminate it at any time by terminating my participation in the Plan as
provided in the terms and conditions of the Plan.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and

proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.
