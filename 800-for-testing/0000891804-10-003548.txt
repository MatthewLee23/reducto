Chairman's
Letter to Shareholders

[PHOTO OF ROBERT P. BREMNER]

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

The economic environment in which your Fund operates reflects continuing but
uneven economic recovery. The U.S. and other major industrial countries are
experiencing steady but comparatively low levels of economic growth, while
emerging market countries are seeing a resumption of relatively strong economic
expansion. The potential impact of steps being considered by many governments to
counteract the extraordinary governmental spending and credit expansion to deal
with the recent financial and economic crisis is injecting uncertainty into
global financial markets. The implications for future tax rates, government
spending, interest rates and the pace of economic recovery in the U.S. and other
leading economies are extremely difficult to predict at the present time. The
long term health of the global economy depends on restoring some measure of
fiscal discipline around the world, but since all of the corrective steps
require economic pain, it is not surprising that governments are reluctant to
undertake them.

In the near term, governments remain committed to furthering economic recovery
and realizing a meaningful reduction in their national unemployment rates. Such
an environment should produce continued economic growth and, consequently,
attractive investment opportunities. Over the longer term, the larger
uncertainty mentioned earlier carries the risk of unexpected potholes in the
road to sustained recovery. For this reason, Nuveen's investment management
teams are working hard to balance return and risk by building well-diversified
portfolios, among other strategies. I encourage you to read the following
commentary on the management of your Fund. As always, I also encourage you to
contact your financial consultant if you have any questions about your Nuveen
Fund investment. Please consult the Nuveen web site for the most recent
information on your Nuveen Funds at: www.nuveen.com.

On behalf of the other members of your Fund's Board, we look forward to
continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Bremner

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS TOM SPALDING AND PAUL BRENNAN REVIEW KEY INVESTMENT
STRATEGIES AND THE SIX-MONTH PERFORMANCE OF THESE SIX NATIONAL FUNDS. A 33-YEAR
VETERAN OF NUVEEN, TOM HAS MANAGED NXZ SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2001 AND NPP, NMA,
NMO AND NAD SINCE 2003. WITH 20 YEARS OF INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING TWELVE
YEARS AT NUVEEN, PAUL ASSUMED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NZF IN
2006.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX-MONTH
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2010?

Municipal market conditions began to show general signs of improvement
throughout most of the period. This trend was bolstered by the reduced issuance
of tax-exempt municipal debt in the marketplace, due in part to the introduction
of the Build America Bond program in April 2009. Build America Bonds are a new
class of taxable municipal debt created as part of the February 2009 economic
stimulus package. These bonds currently offer municipal issuers a federal
subsidy equal to 35% of the bonds' interest payments and therefore provide
issuers with an attractive alternative to traditional tax-exempt debt. For the
six-month period ended April 30, 2010, taxable Build America Bond issuance
totaled $48.9 billion, accounting for almost 24% of new bonds in the municipal
marketplace nationwide.

Despite the constrained issuance of tax-exempt municipal bonds, we continued to
find attractive value opportunities, taking a bottom-up approach to discovering
undervalued sectors and individual credits with the potential to perform
relatively well over the long term. Areas of the market where we found value
during this period included essential services bonds such as general obligation
(GO) and other tax-supported credits, health care, education, transportation
(specifically tollroads and airports) and water and sewer.

Some of the areas of investment opportunity that we discovered during this
period were created by the parameters of the Build America Bond program. For
example, tax-exempt supply was usually more plentiful in the health care and
higher education sectors because, as 501(c)(3) (nonprofit) organizations,
hospitals and private universities generally do not qualify for the Build
America Bond program and must continue to issue bonds in the tax-exempt
municipal market. In addition, health care entities were active

issuers during this period, as they sought to replace variable rate issuance
with fixed rates. Refunding issues also are not covered by the Build America
Bond program, and this resulted in attractive opportunities in sectors such as
airports and tollroads. The impact of the Build America Bond program was also
evident in the area of longer-term issuance, as municipal issuers sought to take
full advantage of the attractive financing terms offered by these bonds.
Approximately 70% of Build America Bonds were issued with maturities of 30 years
or more. Even though this significantly reduced the availability of tax-exempt
credits with longer maturities, we continued to find good opportunities to
purchase attractive longer-term bonds for these Funds. These bonds helped us to
extend the durations of Funds such as NXZ and NZF that were slightly short of
our target duration range and also rewarded investors as the yield curve
remained steep. In Funds with longer durations, we tended to focus more on
intermediate maturity bonds with higher coupons.

Cash for new purchases during this period was generated primarily by the
proceeds from bond calls and redemptions. NZF also trimmed holdings of
pre-refunded bonds through selling and redemptions. In general, selling was very
limited during this period because the bonds in our portfolios offered higher
yields than those available in the current marketplace.

As of April 30, 2010, all six of these Funds continued to use inverse floating
rate securities.(1) We employ inverse floaters for a variety of reasons,
including leverage, duration management and both income and total return
enhancement.

For the six months ended April 30, 2010, the cumulative returns on common share
net asset value (NAV) for all six of these Funds exceeded the return for the
Standard & Poor's (S&P) National Municipal Bond Index. For the same period, the
Funds lagged the average return for the Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt
Funds Average.

      ten-year are annualized.

      Past performance is not predictive of future results.  Current performance
      may be higher or lower than the data  shown.  Returns do not  reflect  the

(1)   An inverse floating rate security,  also known as an inverse floater, is a
      financial  instrument  designed to pay long-term  tax-exempt interest at a
      rate that varies  inversely  with a short-term  tax-exempt  interest  rate
      index.  For the Nuveen Funds,  the index  typically used is the Securities
      Industry and Financial  Markets (SIFM)  Municipal  Swap Index  (previously
      referred  to as  the  Bond  Market  Association  Index  or  BMA).  Inverse
      floaters,  including  those inverse  floating rate securities in which the
      Funds invested  during this reporting  period,  are further defined within
      the Notes to  Financial  Statements  and  Glossary  of Terms  Used in this
      Report sections of this report.

(2)   The  Standard  &  Poor's  (S&P)  National   Municipal  Bond  Index  is  an
      unleveraged,   market   value-weighted   index  designed  to  measure  the
      performance of the investment-grade U.S. municipal bond market. This index
      does not reflect any initial or ongoing  expenses and is not available for
      direct investment.

(3)   The Lipper  General  Leveraged  Municipal Debt Funds Average is calculated
      using the returns of all closed-end funds in this category for each period
      as follows:  6-month,  54 funds;  1-year, 54 funds;  5-year, 52 funds; and
      10-year,  38 funds.  Lipper returns  account for the effects of management
      fees  and  assume  reinvestment  of  dividends,  but  do not  reflect  any
      applicable  sales charges.  The Lipper average is not available for direct
      investment.

Key management factors that influenced the Funds' returns during this period
included yield curve and duration positioning, credit exposure and sector
allocation. In addition, the use of leverage was an important positive factor
affecting the Funds' performances over this period. The impact of leverage is
discussed in more detail on page five.

During this period, bonds with longer maturities generally outperformed credits
with shorter maturities, with bonds at the longest end of the yield curve
posting the strongest returns. The outperformance of longer bonds was due in
part to the decline in interest rates, particularly at the longer end of the
curve. The scarcity of tax-exempt bonds with longer maturities also drove up the
prices of these bonds. Overall, duration and yield curve positioning were
positive for the performances of all six of these Funds during this period.

Credit exposure also played a role in performance of these funds. The demand for
municipal bonds increased during the period driven by a variety of factors,
including concerns about potential tax increases, the need to rebalance
portfolio allocations and a growing appetite for additional risk. At the same
time, the supply of issuance of new tax-exempt municipal securities declined. As
investors bid up municipal bond prices, bonds rated BBB or below generally
outperformed those rated AAA. In this environment, the Funds' performances
benefited from their allocations to lower quality credits. This was especially
true in NMA, which had the heaviest weightings of bonds rated BBB or lower and
non-rated bonds among these six Funds.

Holdings that generally contributed positively to the Fund's performance during
this period included industrial development revenue, health care and housing
bonds. Revenue bonds as a whole performed well, with transportation, leasing and
special tax among the sectors outperforming the general municipal market for
this period. Zero coupon bonds also were among the strongest performers, as were
lower-rated tobacco bonds backed by the 1998 master tobacco settlement
agreement.

Pre-refunded bonds, which are often backed by U.S. Treasury securities,
performed relatively poorly during this period. The underperformance of these
bonds can be attributed primarily to their shorter effective maturities and
higher credit quality. As of April 30, 2010, NXZ and NZF had the largest
exposures to pre-refunded bonds, while NAD had the smallest allocation. On the
whole, general obligation (GO) bonds lagged the overall municipal market by a
small margin, while water and sewer, education, electric utilities, and resource
recovery bonds trailed the other revenue sectors for the six months.

IMPACT OF THE FUNDS' CAPITAL STRUCTURES AND LEVERAGE STRATEGIES ON PERFORMANCE

One important factor impacting the returns of most of these Funds relative to
the comparative index was the Funds' use of financial leverage. The Funds use
leverage because their managers believe that, over time, leveraging provides
opportunities for additional income and total return for common shareholders.
However, use of leverage also can expose common shareholders to additional
volatility. For example, as the prices of securities held by a Fund decline, the
negative impact of these valuation changes on common share net asset value and
common shareholder total return is magnified by the use of leverage. Conversely,
leverage may enhance common share returns during periods when bond prices
generally are rising.

Leverage made a positive contribution to the performance of these Funds over
this reporting period.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE FUNDS' LEVERAGED CAPITAL STRUCTURE

Shortly after their inceptions, each of the Funds issued auction rate preferred
shares (ARPS) to create financial leverage. As noted in past shareholder
reports, the ARPS issued by many closed-end funds, including these Funds, have
been hampered by a lack of liquidity since February 2008. Since that time, more
ARPS have been submitted for sale in each of their regularly scheduled auctions
than there have been offers to buy. In fact, offers to buy have been almost
completely non-existent since late February 2008. This means that these auctions
have "failed to clear," and that many, or all, of the ARPS shareholders who
wanted to sell their shares in these auctions were unable to do so. This lack of
liquidity in ARPS did not lower the credit quality of these shares, and ARPS
shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the "maximum
rate" applicable to failed auctions, as calculated in accordance with the
pre-established terms of the ARPS. In the recent market, with short-term rates
at multi-generational lows, those maximum rates also have been low.

One continuing implication for common shareholders from the auction failures is
that each Fund's cost of leverage likely has been incrementally higher at times
than it otherwise might have been had the auctions continued to be successful.
As a result, each Fund's common share earnings likely have been incrementally
lower at times than they otherwise might have been.

<PAGE>

As noted in past shareholder reports, the Nuveen funds' Board of
Directors/Trustees authorized several methods to refinance a portion of the
Nuveen funds' outstanding ARPS. Some funds have utilized tender option bonds
(TOBs), also known as floating rate securities, for leverage purposes. The
amount of TOBs that a fund may use varies according to the composition of each
fund's portfolio. Some funds have a greater ability to use TOBs than others.
Some funds have issued Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares (VRDP), but these
issuances have been limited since it has been difficult to find liquidity
providers on economically viable terms given the constrained credit environment.
Some funds have issued MuniFund Term Preferred Shares (MTP), a fixed rate form
of preferred stock with a mandatory redemption period of five years.

While all these efforts have reduced the total amount of outstanding ARPS issued
by the Nuveen funds, the Funds cannot provide any assurance on when the
remaining outstanding ARPS might be redeemed.

On April 9, 2010, twenty-six Nuveen leveraged closed-end funds, including NAD,
NXZ and NZF, received a demand letter from a law firm on behalf of each fund's
common shareholders, alleging that Nuveen and the fund's officers and Board of
Directors/Trustees breached their fiduciary duties related to the redemption at
par of the fund's ARPS. The funds' independent Board is evaluating the demand
letter for each fund.

As of April 30, 2010, the amounts of ARPS redeemed at par by the following Funds

As of April 30, 2010, NAD had issued and outstanding $144.3 million of MTP, and
NMA, NMO and NXZ had issued and outstanding $296.8, $350.9 and $196.0 million of
VRDP, respectively. (Refer to Notes to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 -
General Information and Significant Accounting Policies and Footnote 4 - Fund
Shares for further details on MTP and VRDP.)

During this six-month reporting period, NZF filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement seeking to register MTP. This
registration statement, declared effective by the SEC, enables the Fund to issue
to the public shares of MTP to refinance all or a portion of its outstanding
ARPS. The issuance of MTP by the Fund is subject to market conditions. There is
no assurance that these MTP shares will be issued.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2010, all six
Funds in this report had positive UNII balances, based upon our best estimate,
for tax purposes and positive UNII balances for financial reporting purposes.

      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

      distribution in December 2009 of $0.0668 per share.

(3)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are

(1)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(2)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

(1)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(2)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc. (NPP), Nuveen
Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD), Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3
(NZF) (collectively, the "Funds"). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage
(NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the
New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend
Advantage 3 (NZF) are traded on the NYSE Amex. The Funds are registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, management
investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a portfolio of municipal obligations issued by state
and local government authorities or certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with US
generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").

INVESTMENT VALUATION

Exchange-listed securities are generally valued at the last sales price on the
security exchange on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on a securities exchange for which there are no transactions on a given
day or securities not listed on a securities exchange are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices. Securities traded on NASDAQ are valued at the
NASDAQ Official Closing Price. The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's
investment portfolio are provided by a pricing service approved by the Fund's
Board of Directors/Trustees. Futures contracts are valued using the closing
settlement price or, in the absence of such a price, at the mean of the bid and
asked prices. When market price quotes are not readily available (which is
usually the case for municipal securities), the pricing service or, in the
absence of a pricing service for a particular investment or derivative
instrument, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Fund, or its designee, may
establish fair value using a wide variety of market data including yields or
prices of investments of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon, maturity and
rating, market quotes or indications of value from security dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral, general market conditions and other
information and analysis, including the obligor's credit characteristics
considered relevant. Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate
and demand features qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates value.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2010, Municipal
Advantage (NMA) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) had outstanding
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments of $2,194,071 and $8,119,360,
respectively. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the
other Funds.

INVESTMENT INCOME

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividend income is recorded
on the ex-dividend date or when information is available. Interest income, which
includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for financial
reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis. Investment income also
includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

INCOME TAXES

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will
                                                           Nuveen Investments 83
<PAGE>

    | Notes to
    | Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

enable interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal
income tax, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of
the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid by
the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions, management of the
Funds has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that
would require recognition in the financial statements. Open tax years are those
that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the last
four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). Furthermore,
management of the Funds is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly change in the next twelve months.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. GAAP.

AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

The following Funds have issued and outstanding Auction Rate Preferred Shares
("ARPS"), $25,000 stated value per share, as a means of effecting financial
leverage. Each Fund's ARPS are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate
paid by the Funds on each Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a
dutch auction process overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end
of each rate period. As of April 30, 2010, the number of ARPS outstanding, by
Series and in total, for each Fund is as follows:

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the ARPS issued by the Funds than there were offers to
buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear," and that many ARPS
shareholders who wanted to sell their shares in these auctions were unable to do
so. ARPS shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the
"maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with
the pre-established terms of the ARPS. As of April 30, 2010, the aggregate
amount of outstanding ARPS redeemed by each Fund is as follows:

MUNIFUND TERM PREFERRED SHARES

Dividend Advantage (NAD) has issued and outstanding $144,300,000, of 2.70%,
Series 2015 MuniFund Term Preferred ("MTP") Shares, with a $10 liquidation value
per share. Dividends, which are recognized as interest expense for financial
reporting purposes, will be paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 2.70%,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Proceeds from the issuance of
MTP Shares, net of offering expenses, were used to redeem a portion of the
Fund's outstanding ARPS.

The Fund is obligated to redeem the MTP Shares on April 1, 2015, unless earlier
redeemed or repurchased by the Fund. MTP Shares are subject to optional and
mandatory redemption in certain circumstances. As of April 1, 2011, the MTP
Shares will be subject to redemption at the option of the Fund, subject to
payment of a premium until March 31, 2012, and at par thereafter. The MTP Shares
also will be subject to redemption, at the option of the Fund, at par in the
event of certain changes in the credit rating of the MTP Shares. The Fund may be
obligated to redeem certain of the MTP Shares if the Fund fails to maintain
certain asset coverage and leverage ratio requirements and such failures are not
cured by the applicable cure date.

84 Nuveen Investments

<PAGE>

The redemption price per share is equal to the sum of the liquidation value per
share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends. The MTP Shares trade on NYSE
under the symbol "NAD Pr C".

During the period from March 16, 2010 (first issuance date of shares) through
April 30, 2010, Dividend Advantage (NAD) had an average balance of $143,582,609
MTP Shares outstanding.

Net amounts earned by Nuveen as underwriter of the Fund's MTP Share offering are
passed directly to the Fund and recognized as a component of "Investment Income"
on the Statement of Operations. For the six months ended April 30, 2010 there
were no amounts earned by Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").

For financial reporting purposes only, the liquidation value of MTP Shares is
recorded as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Unpaid
dividends on the MTP Shares are recognized as a component of "Interest payable"
on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Dividends paid on MTP Shares are
recognized as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of offering
costs" on the Statement of Operations.

VARIABLE RATE DEMAND PREFERRED SHARES

Municipal Advantage (NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage 2
(NXZ) have issued and outstanding 2,968, 3,509 and 1,960 Series 1 Variable Rate
Demand Preferred ("VRDP") Shares, $100,000 liquidation value per share,
respectively. Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) issued its VRDP Shares in a privately
negotiated offering in August 2008, and Municipal Advantage (NMA) and Market
Opportunity (NMO) issued their respective VRDP Shares in March 2010. Proceeds of
each Fund's offering were used to redeem a portion of each Fund's outstanding
ARPS. The VRDP Shares were offered to institutional buyers as defined pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, have a maturity date of August 1,
2038, for Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and March 1, 2040, for Municipal Advantage
(NMA) and Market Opportunity (NMO).

VRDP Shares include a liquidity feature that allows VRDP shareholders to have
their shares purchased by a liquidity provider with whom the Fund has contracted
in the event that purchase orders for VRDP Shares in a remarketing are not
sufficient in number to be matched with the sale orders in that remarketing.
Municipal Advantage (NMA) and Market Opportunity (NMO) are required to redeem
any VRDP Shares that are still owned by the liquidity provider after six months
of continuous, unsuccessful remarketing. As to Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ), the
terms of whose VRDP Shares do not presently provide the liquidity provider with
the right to cause the Fund to redeem VRDP Shares after six months of
continuous, unsuccessful remarketing, the Board of Directors/Trustees has
approved, in connection with renewing its liquidity provider contract in June
2010, the issuance of replacement VRDP Shares that would provide the liquidity
provider with a right of redemption after six months of continuous unsuccessful
remarketing.

Dividends on the VRDP Shares (which are treated as interest payments for
financial reporting purposes) are set weekly at a rate established by a
remarketing agent; therefore, the market value of the VRDP Shares is expected to
approximate its liquidation value. If remarketings for VRDP Shares are
continuously unsuccessful for six months, the maximum rate is designed to
escalate according to a specified schedule in order to enhance the remarketing
agent's ability to successfully remarket the VRDP Shares.

Subject to certain conditions, VRDP Shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part,
at any time at the option of the Fund. The Fund may also redeem certain of the
VRDP Shares if the Fund fails to maintain certain asset coverage requirements
and such failures are not cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption
price per share is equal to the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any
accumulated but unpaid dividends.

Municipal Advantage (NMA) and Market Opportunity (NMO) issued all $296,800,000
and $350,900,000 of its VRDP Shares on March 18, 2010 and March 31, 2010, with
annualized interest rates of 0.37% and 0.44%, respectively. Dividend Advantage 2
(NXZ) had all $196,000,000 of its VRDP Shares outstanding during the six months
ended April 30, 2010, with an annualized interest rate of 0.31%.

For financial reporting purposes only, the liquidation value of VRDP Shares is
recognized as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Unpaid
dividends on VRDP Shares are recognized as a component of "Interest payable" on
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Dividends paid on the VRDP Shares are
recognized as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of offering
costs" on the Statement of Operations. In addition to this interest expense, the
Funds also pay a per annum liquidity fee to the liquidity provider, which is
recognized as "Liquidity fees" on the Statement of Operations.

INVERSE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES

Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying
bond but also on the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates,
and because the inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of
loss of the greater face value of the underlying bond.

                                                           Nuveen Investments 85

<PAGE>

    | Notes to
    | Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the
Fund the right (a) to cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to
tender their notes at par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate
bond held by the trust to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment
in an externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as "(IF) - Inverse floating rate investment." An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater is accounted for as a financing transaction. In
such instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited into a special purpose trust is
identified in the Portfolio of Investments as "(UB) - Underlying bond of an
inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing transaction," with the Fund
accounting for the short-term floating rate certificates issued by the trust as
"Floating rate obligations" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In
addition, the Fund reflects in "Investment Income" the entire earnings of the
underlying bond and recognizes the related interest paid to the holders of the
short-term floating rate certificates as a component of "Interest expense and
amortization of offering costs" on the Statement of Operations.

During the six months ended April 30, 2010, each Fund invested in
externally-deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

Each Fund may also enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements (sometimes
referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit recovery swap") (such agreements
referred to herein as "Recourse Trusts") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund
agrees to reimburse the broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the
trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate certificates issued by the
trust plus any shortfalls in interest cash flows. Under these agreements, a
Fund's potential exposure to losses related to or on inverse floaters may
increase beyond the value of a Fund's inverse floater investments as a Fund may
potentially be liable to fulfill all amounts owed to holders of the floating
rate certificates. At period end, any such shortfall is recognized as
"Unrealized depreciation on Recourse Trusts" on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

At April 30, 2010, each Fund's maximum exposure to externally-deposited Recourse
Trusts is as follows:

FUTURES CONTRACTS

Each Fund is subject to interest rate risk in the normal course of pursuing its
investment objectives and is authorized to invest in futures contracts in
attempt to manage such risk. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund is
required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or liquid securities equal
to a specified percentage of the contract amount. This is known as the "initial
margin." Cash held by the broker to cover initial margin requirements on open
futures contracts, if any, is recognized as "Deposits with brokers for open
futures contracts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Subsequent
payments ("variation margin") are made or received by a Fund each day, depending
on the daily fluctuation of the value of the contract. Variation margin is
recognized as a receivable or payable for "Variation margin on futures
contracts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, when applicable.

During the period the futures contract is open, changes in the value of the
contract are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss by "marking-to-market" on a
daily basis to reflect the changes in market value of the contract and is
recognized as "Change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of futures
contracts" on the Statement of Operations. When the contract is closed or
expired, a Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the contract on the closing date and value of the contract when
originally entered into and is recognized as "Net realized gain (loss) from
futures contracts" on the Statement of Operations.

Risks of investments in futures contracts include the possible adverse movement
of the securities or indices underlying the contracts, the possibility that
there may not be a liquid secondary market for the contracts and/or that a
change in the value of the contract may not correlate with a change in the value
of the underlying securities or indices. The Funds did not invest in futures
contracts during the six months ended April 30, 2010.

MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

In the normal course of business each Fund may invest in financial instruments
and enter into financial transactions where risk of potential loss exists due to
changes in the market (market risk) or failure of the other party to the
transaction to perform (counterparty credit risk). The potential loss could
exceed the value of the financial assets recorded on the financial statements.
Financial assets, which potentially expose each Fund to counterparty credit
risk, consist principally of cash due from counterparties on forward, option and
swap transactions, when applicable. The extent of each Fund's exposure to
counterparty credit risk in respect to these financial assets approximates their
carrying value as recorded on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Futures
contracts, when applicable, expose a Fund to minimal counterparty credit risk as
they are exchange traded and the exchange's clearinghouse, which is counterparty
to all exchange traded futures, guarantees the futures contracts against
default.

Each Fund helps manage counterparty credit risk by entering into agreements only
with counterparties that Nuveen Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Nuveen believes have the financial resources to honor their
obligations and by having the Adviser monitor the financial stability of the
counterparties. Additionally, counterparties may be required to pledge
collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of the financial asset) on behalf
of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized
gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when each Fund has an
unrealized loss, the Funds have instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the
Funds as collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the
unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are
monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the valuations fluctuate, either
up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount.

ZERO COUPON SECURITIES

Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more
volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

OFFERING COSTS

Costs incurred by Municipal Advantage (NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO) and
Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) in connection with their offerings of VRDP Shares
($2,134,000), ($4,214,000) and ($2,270,000), respectively, were recorded as
deferred charges which will be amortized over the 30-year life of the shares.
Cost incurred by Dividend Advantage (NAD) in connection with its offering of MTP
Shares ($2,559,500) were recorded as a deferred charge which will be amortized
over the 5-year life of the shares. Each Fund's amortized deferred charges are
recognized as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of offering
costs" on the Statement of Operations.

CUSTODIAN FEE CREDIT

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their officers and directors/trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of increases and decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares
from operations during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.

2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In determining the value of each Fund's investments, various inputs are used.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:

      Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

      Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
      similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).

      Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including management's
      assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities. The following is a
summary of each Fund's fair value measurements as of April 30, 2010:

6. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
securities reflected as financing transactions, if any. To the extent that
differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented
in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. Temporary differences do not
require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the
net asset values of the Funds.

At April 30, 2010, the cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
investments as determined on a federal income tax basis, were as follows:

7. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components -- a fund-level fee,
based only on the amount of assets within each individual Fund, and a
complex-level fee, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by
the Adviser. This pricing structure enables each Fund's shareholders to benefit
from growth in the assets within their respective Fund as well as from growth in
the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee for each Fund, payable monthly, is calculated
according to the following schedules:

                                                          PERFORMANCE PLUS (NPP)

================================================================================

*     The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate daily managed assets of all Nuveen
      funds, with such daily managed assets defined separately for each fund in
      its management agreement, but excluding assets attributable to investments
      in other Nuveen funds. For the complex-level and fund-level fees, daily
      managed assets include assets managed by the Adviser that are attributable
      to financial leverage. For these purposes, financial leverage includes the
      funds' use of preferred stock and borrowings and investments in the
      residual interest certificates (also called inverse floating rate
      securities) in tender option bond (TOB) trusts, including the portion of
      assets held by a TOB trust that has been effectively financed by the
      trust's issuance of floating rate securities, subject to an agreement by
      the Adviser to limit the amount of such assets for determining managed
      assets in certain circumstances. As of April 30, 2010, the complex-level
      fee rate was .1852%.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its directors/trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
directors/trustees that enables directors/trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

8. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

During June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
changes to the authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for
transfers of financial assets. The objective of this guidance is to improve the
relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information
that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of
financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial
performance, and cash flows; and transferor's continuing involvement, if any, in
transferred financial assets.

This guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first
annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods
within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting
periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. The recognition and
measurement provisions of this guidance must be applied to transfers occurring
on or after the effective date. Additionally, the disclosure provisions of this
guidance should be applied to transfers that occurred both before and after the
effective date of this guidance. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of this guidance and the impact it will have on the financial
statement amounts and disclosures, if any.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 21, 2010, FASB issued changes to the authoritative guidance under
U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements. The objective of this guidance is to
provide guidance on how investment assets and liabilities are to be valued and
disclosed. Specifically, the amendment requires reporting entities to disclose
i) the input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both
recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, for both Level 2 and Level 3
positions, ii) transfers between all levels (including Level 1 and Level 2) on a
gross basis (i.e., transfers out must be disclosed separately from transfers in)
as well as the reason(s) for the transfer and iii) purchases, sales, issuances
and settlements in the Level 3 rollforward must be shown on a gross basis rather
than as one net number. The effective date of the amendment is for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, however, the requirement to
provide the Level 3 activity for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on
a gross basis will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2010. At this time, the management is evaluating the implications
of this guidance and the impact it will have to the financial statement amounts
and footnote disclosures, if any.

*     Annualized.

**    Rounds to less than $.01 per share.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      Shares and/or Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares, where applicable.

(a)   Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

(b)   Expense ratios do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits
      earned on the Fund's net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where
      applicable.

(c)   The expense ratios reflect, among other things, payments to Variable Rate
      Demand Preferred shareholders and/or the interest expense deemed to have
      been paid by the Fund on the floating rate certificates issued by the
      special purpose trusts for the self-deposited inverse floaters held by the
      Fund, where applicable, as described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

(d)   For the six months ended April 30, 2010.

*     Annualized.

**    For the period March 16, 2010 (first issuance date of shares) through
      April 30, 2010.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      Shares, MuniFund Term Preferred Shares and/or Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares, where applicable.

(a)   Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

(b)   After expense reimbursement from the Adviser, where applicable. Expense
      ratios do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits earned on the
      Fund's net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where applicable. As
      of July 31, 2009, the Adviser is no longer reimbursing Dividend Advantage
      (NAD) for any fees and expenses.

(c)   The expense ratios reflect, among other things, payments to MuniFund Term
      Preferred shareholders, Variable Rate Demand Preferred shareholders and/or
      the interest expense deemed to have been paid by the Fund on the floating
      rate certificates issued by the special purpose trusts for the
      self-deposited inverse floaters held by the Fund, where applicable, as
      described in Footnote 1 - MuniFund Term Preferred Shares, Variable Rate
      Demand Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities,
      respectively.

(d)   For the six months ended April 30, 2010.

N/A   Fund does not have a contractual reimbursement agreement with the Adviser.

*     Annualized.

**    Rounds to less than $.01 per share.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      Shares and/or Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares, where applicable.

(a)   Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

(b)   After expense reimbursement from the Adviser, where applicable. Expense
      ratios do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits earned on the
      Fund's net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where applicable.

(c)   The expense ratios reflect, among other things, payments to Variable Rate
      Demand Preferred shareholders and/or the interest expense deemed to have
      been paid by the Fund on the floating rate certificates issued by the
      special purpose trusts for the self-deposited inverse floaters held by the
      Fund, where applicable, as described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

(d)   For the six months ended April 30, 2010.

Reinvest Automatically
Easily and Conveniently

NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET UP YOUR
REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price

<PAGE>

per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of Terms
Used in this Report

o     AUCTION RATE BOND: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
      payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
      process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
      Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
      sale are deemed to have "failed", with current holders receiving a
      formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

o     AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over which a bond's
      principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a measure of the
      sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when market
      interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration,
      the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates
      change.

o     INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities, also known as inverse
      floaters, are created by depositing a municipal bond, typically with a
      fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
      broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a) issues floating rate certificates
      typically paying short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties in
      amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or
      market value, and (b) issues an inverse floating rate certificate
      (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") to an investor (such as a
      Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure to a long-term municipal
      bond. The income received by the holder of the inverse floater varies
      inversely with the short-term rate paid to the floating rate certificates'
      holders, and in most circumstances the holder of the inverse floater bears
      substantially all of the underlying bond's downside investment risk. The
      holder of the inverse floater typically also benefits disproportionately
      from any potential appreciation of the underlying bond's value. Hence, an
      inverse floater essentially represents an investment in the underlying
      bond on a leveraged basis.

o     LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's NAV per share is calculated by subtracting
      the liabilities of the Fund from its total assets and then dividing the
      remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
      the end of each business day.

o     PRE-REFUNDING: Pre-refunding, also known as advanced refundings or
      refinancings, is a procedure used by state and local governments to
      refinance municipal bonds to lower interest expenses. The issuer sells new
      bonds with a lower yield and uses the proceeds to buy U.S. Treasury
      securities, the interest from which is used to make payments on the
      higher-yielding bonds. Because of this collateral, pre-refunding generally
      raises a bond's credit rating and thus its value.

o     TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     ZERO COUPON BOND: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.

          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the

directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
