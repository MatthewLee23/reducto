                  Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and/or Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four
Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into
account the information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements
include all statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact.
For example, forward-looking statements include the use of words such as
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may,"
"should," "would" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or
outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the
information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the
Advisor and/or Four Corners and their respective representatives only as of the
date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these
forward-looking statements to reflect events and circumstances that arise after
the date hereof.

                         Performance and Risk Disclosure

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of other risks of investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                             How to Read This Report

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of Four
Corners are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II

The primary investment objective of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There
can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The
Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

Market Recap

The six-month period ending November 30, 2008 was the worst and most volatile
period in Senior Loan market history. The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the
"Index") had a negative return of -25.96% during the period, and is down -26.95%
calendar year to November 30, 2008. Historically, the Index has never had a
negative year. The global financial crisis has obviously reduced asset prices
across almost every asset class, and the Senior Loan market has been no
exception. Additionally, the market-specific issues that have contributed to
Senior Loans' poor performance are discussed in more detail below.


                                                                          Page 3

              PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (Continued) (Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As a result of the credit market dislocation that began in July 2007 and the
ensuing global financial crisis, loan prices have declined dramatically. In
2007, prices began to decline as a result of an imbalance in the supply/demand
relationship in the Senior Loan market. Demand for Senior Loans dramatically
decreased as the market for structured products fell apart following the credit
crisis. The swift and severe decline in demand for Senior Loans coincided with
an unprecedented amount of supply, as reduced prices caused broad-based forced
selling and a large inventory of unsold new-issue loans remained.

This supply/demand relationship only worsened in 2008 from a combination of weak
economic data and earnings, a spike in ratings downgrades, rising default rates
and a surge of supply from continued forced liquidations. Many investors in the
Senior Loan market leverage their assets by using proceeds from borrowed money
to purchase Senior Loans. As loan prices have declined, debt providers have
forced funds to sell loans in order to repay the borrowed money. This dynamic of
forced selling often begets more selling since it forces market prices lower.
This forced selling began in July 2007 and has been dramatic in the last three
months ended November 30, 2008. Index returns for the three months ended
November 30, 2008 were -25.48%, multiples of the prior lowest period returns.

While few things are certain in these turbulent times, we believe a reduction in
the volume of forced loan sales will be necessary for the loan market to achieve
some price stability. Likewise, the demand side remains weak, with
collateralized loan obligation creation virtually non-existent, and retail
loan-based funds experiencing outflows. While there has been activity among some
major institutional investors and distressed accounts stepping into the market
to take advantage of low loan prices and wide spreads, the incremental demand is
not broad based and is not nearly sufficient to offset the volume of forced
selling.

Finally, fundamental performance has also weakened and, in our opinion, this may
be keeping new investors at bay. The average year-over-year EBITDA growth among
publicly filed issuers in the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index dropped to a
five-year low of 0.1%, from 9.7% in the second quarter, according to CompuStat
(a unit of S&P). The loan default rate has climbed 3.5 percentage points through
the first 11 months of the calendar year, the steepest 11-month increase since
February 2001.1 There have been 41 defaults in the loan market through November,
2008, compared to three in the same period of 2007.2 Likewise, covenant
amendments among institutional loans soared to 44 so far in the fourth quarter
of 2008, versus 27 in the third quarter of 2008, and 14 during the last three
months of 2007. Year-to-date, LCD News has reported 131 amendments, up from 38
in all of 2007.1 The need for covenant amendments typically results from weak
performance.

Performance Analysis

FCT generated a total return of -50.91% including market price change and
dividends for the six-months ended November 30, 2008. The Fund's net asset value
("NAV") total return was -43.70% over the same period. The NAV return trailed
the Index return by -17.74%. The Fund's performance includes the negative impact
of leverage in a negative return environment as well as the negative impact of
fees, expenses, and un-invested cash balances which are not part of the
benchmark return. FCT's NAV return exceeded the "pure-play" peer group average
by 0.14% and the broad peer group average by 0.45%.3 The Fund's closing price on
November 28, 2008 was $6.96, which represented a -21.62% discount to its NAV,
compared to the Fund's discount to NAV of -10.11% six months earlier on May 31,
2008.

While credit spreads have widened significantly since July 2007, the underlying
FCT portfolio is still primarily comprised of Senior Loans purchased during the
last several years. The credit spreads on these Senior Loans are below the
current yields on Senior Loans, which are trading at significant discounts to
their issuance prices.

The price decline of Senior Loans has pressured the Fund's NAV, resulting in an
increase in the Fund's leverage percentage. In order to stay within the Fund's
investment guidelines and leverage covenants, the Fund has sold Senior Loans at
a discount, using the proceeds to reduce the Fund's leverage. This has generated
realized losses and has also impacted the Fund's ability to generate dividend
income.

While several Fund peers have been unable to maintain paying their dividends,
FCT's dividends have been uninterrupted. However, the Fund's income has declined
primarily as a result of lower LIBOR rates and a smaller asset base. The
dividend distribution totaled $0.45 per Common Share during the past six months
ended November 30, 2008, which represented a 29.81% decrease from the prior six
months ended May 31, 2008. Based on the Fund's current dividend, FCT's
distribution rate is 11.38% (calculated on the Fund's share price) and 8.92%
(based on the Fund's NAV) as of November 30, 2008. The last twelve months
dividends produced a Fund yield based on price of 15.82%, which was slightly
higher than the pure-play peer group average price yield of 15.18% and lower
than the broad peer group average price yield of 17.40%.

              PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (Continued) (Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


While we are disappointed with the Senior Loan market's heightened volatility
and poor market price performance, we have been pleased to maintain the Fund's
dividend in these difficult times. As discussed above, the Senior Loan market
witnessed an unprecedented period of volatility during the six-month period
covered by this report. The Fund was no exception as both its market price and
NAV experienced extraordinary declines and, at the end of the period, the Fund's
discount to its NAV had widened to near-record levels. During the period, the
Fund's NAV fluctuated from a high of $16.57 to a low of $8.87, a difference of
$7.70 per Common Share, whereas the market price of the Fund closed as high as
$14.78 and as low as $6.40, a difference of $8.38 per Common Share.

Market and Fund Outlook

We have seen a material increase in loan defaults and will likely see the
default rate continue to escalate as a result of a slowing economy and the
global financial crisis. We also anticipate continued loan volatility as the
supply/demand relationship is not expected to stabilize in the foreseeable
future. Despite this weak fundamental and technical outlook, we still find
Senior Loan investments attractive. Senior Loans often have the highest
collateral security in a company's capital structure, which has historically
allowed Senior Loan lenders to recover approximately 70% of their loan value in
the event of default.4 While historical recovery rates may not continue in the
future, we believe the outcome is significantly better than the outcome of
equity owners or unsecured corporate bond holders in default scenarios. With the
Index price below historical recovery rates, we believe that a lot of negative
performance is already being priced in at current levels.

3  The "pure-play" peer group consists of a smaller subset (FCM, FCT, PPR,
   TLI and VVR) of the broad peer group, which invests almost exclusively in
   Senior Loans. We believe that these "pure-play" funds are generally more
   comparable to the Fund than the broad peer group, as the non-senior loan
   holdings are routinely less than 5% of such funds. Of the broad peer
   group, eleven of the 16 total funds invest a material portion of their
   assets in high-yield bonds, emerging markets debt or other types of
   corporate debt securities.

- ---------------------------
(a)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net

      & Poor's Ratings Group are considered to be below investment grade.

      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates
      which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base lending rate
      plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending
      rate offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London
      Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or
      more United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate.

(e)   This Senior Loan Interest was privately rated upon issuance. The rating
      agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the rating.

      Prior to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in
      transactions exempt from registration (See Note 2F in the Notes
      to Financial Statements).

(m)   This security is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note
      whereby 1.00% of interest per annum will be paid in cash and 13.75% of
      interest per annum shall be paid by the issuer, at its option (i) entirely
      in cash, (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii) in a
      combination of (i) and (ii). Interest is to be paid semi-annually;
      however, the issuer is in default and income is not being accrued.

(n)   This security is fair valued in accordance with valuation procedures
      adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

(o)   Represents the daily interest rate in effect at November 30, 2008.

(p)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax and financial reporting purposes.
      As of November 30, 2008, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for
      all securities in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was
      $0 and the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all  securities
      in which there was an excess of tax cost over value was  $214,707,767.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2008 (Unaudited)

                               1. Fund Description

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. Significant Accounting Policies

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. Portfolio Valuation:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is calculated by dividing
the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued interest), less all
liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends declared but unpaid and any
borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred
Shares, by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of
the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties.
In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations
are deemed unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust
Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's
securities and other investments. Additionally, if events occur after the close
of the principal market for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and
foreign securities), but before the Fund values its assets, that could
materially affect NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method to value the
Fund's securities and other investments. The use of fair value pricing by the
Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. If the pricing
service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior Loan or
such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior Loan at a
fair value according to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as
of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in less than 60 days when purchased are valued at amortized cost.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
("FAS 157"), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This
standard clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional
disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS 157 became effective
for the Fund as of June 1, 2008, the beginning of its current fiscal year. The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are as follows:


                                                                         Page 21

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2008 (Unaudited)


     o  Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
     o  Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted
        prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds,
        credit risk, etc.)
     o  Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
        assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of November 30, 2008 is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. Credit Default Swaps:

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes or to
gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. The Fund may be either the buyer or seller in a credit
default swap transaction. The "buyer" in a credit default swap contract is
obligated to pay the "seller" a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default on the underlying reference
obligation has occurred. If an event of default occurs, the seller must pay the
buyer the full notional value, or "par value," of the reference obligation. In
exchange, the seller receives the par value of securities of the reference
obligor. In the case of cash settlement, the seller will pay the difference
between par and the market value of the securities of the reference obligor. An
event of default may be a grace period extension, obligation acceleration,
repudiation/moratorium, or restructuring.

Buying a credit default swap contract involves the risk that the contract may
expire worthless and the credit risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its
payment obligations to the Fund in the event of default. Selling a credit
default swap contract involves greater risks than if the Fund had invested in
the reference obligation directly. The Fund will segregate cash or liquid assets
in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swap
contracts of which it is a seller. Additionally, the Fund maintains cash or
liquid assets for the full notional amount of the credit default swap contracts
of which it is a seller. The Fund may only enter into such transactions with
counterparties rated A- or higher.

Credit default swap contracts are marked to market daily based upon quotations
from brokers or market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation (depreciation). For a credit default swap contract sold
by the Fund, payment of the agreed-upon amount made by the Fund in the event of
default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of the
referenced debt obligation purchased/received. As of November 30, 2008, the Fund
had no credit default swaps.

C. Repurchase Agreements:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks. As of November 30, 2008, the Fund had no open
repurchase agreements.

D. Securities Transactions and Investment Income:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid assets with a
current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments. At November 30, 2008, the Fund had no
when-issued or delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

E. Unfunded Loan Commitments:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
approximately $1,075,521 as of November 30, 2008. The Fund is obligated to fund
these loan commitments at the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation
from the commitments is $393,270 at November 30, 2008.

F. Restricted Securities:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that cannot be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Prior to registration, restricted securities may only be
resold in transactions exempt from registration. The Fund held restricted
securities at November 30, 2008 as shown in the following table. The Fund does
not have the right to demand that such securities be registered. These
securities are valued according to the valuation procedures as stated in the
Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a discount to

</TABLE>

(1)  Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on
     July 31, 2007.

G. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions
made by the Fund.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2008 is as follows:

       Distributions paid from:                 2008
                                          ----------------
       Ordinary Income                    $    39,756,157

As of May 31, 2008, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

       Undistributed Ordinary Income                  $       128,029
       Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)     $   (54,007,368)
       Accumulated Capital and other losses           $   (11,481,041)

H. Income Taxes:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. At
May 31, 2008, the Fund had available realized capital losses of $3,984,460 and
$3,611,723 to offset future net capital gains through the fiscal years ended
2014 and 2016, respectively.

POST-OCTOBER LOSSES. Under current laws, certain capital losses realized after
October 31 may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2008, the Fund intends
to elect to defer net realized losses incurred from November 1, 2007 through May
31, 2008 of $3,884,858.

In June 2006, FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes." FIN 48 establishes a minimum threshold for
recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return, and is effective for the Fund's current
fiscal year. As of November 30, 2008, management has evaluated the application
of FIN 48 to the Fund, and has determined that no provision for income tax is
required in the Fund's financial statements.

I. Expenses:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

J. Accounting Pronouncement:

In March 2008, FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS
161"). FAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies
for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and


                                                                         Page 23

gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk
related contingent features in derivative agreements. The application of FAS 161
is required for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of FAS 161 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures,
if any.

          3. Investment Advisory Fee and Other Affiliated Transactions

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage. L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares, and the
principal amount of borrowings), minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid
dividends on any outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor")
serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

In accordance with certain fee arrangements, JPMorgan Investor Services Co.
serves as the Fund's Administrator and Fund Accountant, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association serves as the Fund's Custodian and American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company serves as the Fund's Transfer Agent.

PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc., formerly known as PFPC, Inc.,
provides certain administrative services to the Fund in connection with the
Fund's Board of Trustees meetings and other related matters.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid an annual retainer
of $10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund Complex and
an annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each subsequent trust added to the
First Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of
the trusts. No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with board or
committee meetings.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $10,000 annually and the
Audit Committee Chairman is paid $5,000 annually, with such compensation paid by
the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex and divided among those trusts.
Trustees are also reimbursed by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. Effective
January 1, 2008, each of the chairmen of the Nominating and Governance Committee
and Valuation Committee is paid $2,500 annually to serve in such capacities,
with such compensation paid by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex and
divided among those trusts. Also effective January 1, 2008, the Lead Independent
Trustee and each Committee chairman will serve two-year terms. The officers and
interested trustee receive no compensation from the trusts for serving in such
capacities.

                      4. Purchases and Sales of Securities

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the period ended November 30, 2008 were $60,107,183
and $150,597,209, respectively.

                       5. Auction Market Preferred Shares

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of November 30, 2008, the Fund
has 1,600 Series A AMP Shares and 1,600 Series B AMP Shares outstanding at a
liquidation value of $25,000 per share.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date. The Fund pays commissions to the auction agent as
compensation for conducting the auctions. These fees are included in the
"Auction Market Preferred Shares commission fees" on the Statement of
Operations.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2008 (Unaudited)


The markets for auction rate securities have continued to experience a number of
failed auctions, including auctions relating to the Series A AMP Shares and
Series B AMP Shares. A failed auction results when there are not enough bidders
in the auction at rates below the maximum rate as prescribed by the terms of the
security. When an auction fails, the rate is automatically set at the maximum
rate. A failed auction does not cause an acceleration of, or otherwise have any
impact on, outstanding principal amounts due. In the case of the Fund's
outstanding Series A AMP Shares and Series B AMP Shares, the maximum rate under
the terms of those securities has been 125 percent (and could be up to 300
percent, depending on the ratings of the Series A AMP Shares and Series B AMP
Shares) of the greater of: (1) the applicable AA composite commercial paper rate
(for a rate period of fewer than 184 days) or the applicable U.S. Treasury index
rate (for a rate period of 184 days or more), or (2) the applicable
London-InterBank Offered Rate.

On July 2, 2008, the Fund redeemed $20 million of its $100 million outstanding
AMP Shares, consisting of $10 million Series A AMP Shares and $10 million Series
B AMP Shares with proceeds from a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility" -
see Note 6 below) with Citicorp North America Inc., as agent. The Credit
Facility is to be used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an
expiration date of May 15, 2009 and may be renewed annually. The total
commitment under the Credit Facility is $195,000,000. Loans under the Credit
Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to either: (i) a
commercial paper note rate, (ii) Eurodollar Rate plus a margin or (iii) the
prime rate publicly announced by Citibank N.A. plus a margin. The annual
interest rate in effect at July 2, 2008 was 2.79%. The Fund also pays additional
borrowing costs, which include a program fee of 0.75% and a liquidity fee of
0.50% per year. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately
after any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300%
(33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings).

For the six-months ended November 30, 2008, transactions in AMP Shares were as
follows:
                                Series A                     Series B
                           Shares      Value            Shares      Value
                          ----------------------------------------------------
 Outstanding at 5/31/08    2,000    $ 50,000,000        2,000    $ 50,000,000
 Amount Retired             (400)    (10,000,000)        (400)    (10,000,000)
                          ----------------------------------------------------
 Outstanding at 11/30/08   1,600    $ 40,000,000        1,600    $ 40,000,000
                          ====================================================

First Trust is continuing to seek methods for refinancing the approximately $80
million of the Fund's AMP Shares that remain outstanding. The ability to obtain
this refinancing is contingent on finding third parties willing to provide such
financing on a cost effective basis. There is no assurance that First Trust will
be successful in finding such financing, and any such financing arrangements
would be subject to approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of November 30, 2008 was 2.34% and 2.72%
for the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. The high and low annual dividend rates during the
period ended November 30, 2008, for the Series A 7 day auction were 5.94% and
2.11%, respectively, and the average dividend rate was 3.71%. The high and low
annual dividend rates during the period ended November 30, 2008, for the Series
B 28 day auction were 5.00% and 2.72%, respectively, and the average dividend
rate was 3.93%. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly to the
income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to Common
Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          6. Revolving Credit Facility

The Fund has entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit
Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be
used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May
15, 2009 and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a secured
line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made
to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after
any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of
the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit
Facility is $195,000,000. For the period ended November 30, 2008, the average
amount outstanding was $175,488,525. The high and low annual interest rates
during the period ended November 30, 2008, were 3.74% and 2.66%, respectively,
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.01%. The annual interest rate in
effect at November 30, 2008 was 3.24%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing
costs, which include a program fee of 0.75% and a liquidity fee of 0.50% per
year. Such expenses are included in "Interest and fees on loan" on the Statement
of Operations.


                                                                         Page 25

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2008 (Unaudited)

                             7. Risk Considerations

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines that it
is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is
impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and
trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

In 2008, securities markets have been significantly negatively affected by the
financial crisis that initially resulted from the downturn in the subprime
mortgage market in the United States. The potential impact of the financial
crisis on securities markets may prove to be significant and long-lasting and
may have a substantial impact on the value of the Fund.

LOWER GRADE DEBT INSTRUMENTS: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally lower grade. These lower grade debt instruments may become the subject
of bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise subsequently default as to the repayment
of principal and/or payment of interest or be downgraded to ratings in the lower
rating categories. Lower grade debt instruments tend to be less liquid than
higher grade debt instruments.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. The Fund borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing
program and through the issuance of Preferred Shares, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares, with
respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in
compliance with certain Credit Facility provisions, the Fund may not be
permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or Preferred Shares or purchase
Common Shares or Preferred Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. The value of the collateral may not
equal the Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline
below the principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's
investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the
borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the
stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or
substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under
collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior
Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of
non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be
readily liquidated.

AUCTION RISK: Numerous closed-funds, including the Fund, have been experiencing
failed auctions involving their auction-rate Preferred Shares. Based on current
market conditions, we expect that auctions may continue to fail. If an auction
fails you may not be able to sell some or all of your Preferred Shares. No third
parties related to the auction nor the Fund itself are obligated to purchase
Preferred Shares in an auction or otherwise, nor is the Fund required to redeem
Preferred Shares in the event of a failed auction.

                               8. Indemnification

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              9. Subsequent Events

On November 20, 2008, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0660 per share to
Common Shareholders of record December 3, 2008, payable December 12, 2008.

On December 22, 2008, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0660 per share to
Common Shareholders of record January 6, 2009, payable January 15, 2009.

On January 20, 2009, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0510 per share to Common
Shareholders of record February 4, 2009, payable February 17, 2009.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                          November 30, 2008 (Unaudited)

                           Dividend Reinvestment Plan

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

     (1) If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at the
         time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal to
         the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii) 95% of the
         market price on that date.

     (2) If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
         Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
         purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere,
         for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price
         for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed
         its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by
         the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation,
         resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or
         distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The
         Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions received in cash to
         purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of the
         valuation date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
         purchases is necessary to comply with federal securities laws. Interest
         will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 659-2649, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions and a transaction fee of $15.00.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, 11219 or through their
website located at www.amstock.com (you will need to know your 10-digit
participant number and social security number to gain access to your account
online).

     Potential Conflicts of Interests

In general, Four Corners seeks to allocate the purchase and sale of corporate
loans to clients in a fair and equitable manner to quickly and prudently create
a well-constructed, fully invested portfolio of corporate loans. Since Four
Corners' clients have varying investment restrictions, and because of the
constraining mechanics of the corporate loan market, allocation of trades
through methods such as pro-rata allocation are not feasible. Therefore, the
allocation of corporate loan purchases and sales to various accounts is
generally based on factors such as the client's investment restrictions and
objectives, including expected liquidity and/or third party credit ratings, the
client's acceptance or rejection of prospective investments, if applicable, and
the relative percentage of invested assets of a client's portfolio, among
others. Assets may be disproportionately allocated to accounts during their
initial investment (ramp up) period, notwithstanding that other accounts may
also have assets available for investment. Such disproportionate allocation to
accounts during the ramp-up process may have a detrimental effect on other
accounts. Subject to the foregoing, whenever Four Corners' clients have
available funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each
will be allocated in a manner Four Corners believes to be equitable to each,
although such allocation may result in a delay in one or more client accounts
being fully invested that would not occur if an allocation to other client
accounts were not made. Moreover, it is possible that due to differing
investment objectives or for other reasons, Four Corners and its affiliates may
purchase securities or loans of an issuer for one client and at approximately
the same time recommend selling or sell the same or similar types of securities
or loans for another client. For these and other reasons, not all portfolios
will participate in the gains or losses experienced by other portfolios with
similar investment objectives.

     Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team Members

Portfolio Manager and Management Team compensation is typically comprised of a
base salary and a bonus. There are no pre-determined formulas to determine base
salaries or bonus amounts. Bonuses for all employees, including the Portfolio
Managers, are discretionary. In addition, the Portfolio Managers have stock
options of Macquarie Group Limited. These options are in varying amounts and are
subject to certain vesting and other provisions of the Macquarie option plan.
Finally, the Portfolio Managers are Members of the entity recently purchased by
Macquarie Group Limited, and there are certain payments associated with that
purchase which will be paid over time. A portion of those payments is based on
achieving certain revenue targets.

The Portfolio Managers' salaries are set at certain levels and may be raised at
the discretion of Macquarie Group Limited. Bonuses are entirely discretionary,
and are likely to be related to, among other things, business unit profitability
and personal performance. Compensation is determined without regard to the
performance of any one particular fund. The Portfolio Managers have no direct
incentive to take undue risks when individual fund performance is lagging.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the shareholders

     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or
     240.15d-15(b)).


(b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
     financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
     CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's second fiscal
     quarter of the period covered by this report that has materially
     affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
     registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

         (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

         the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process, summarize, and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
