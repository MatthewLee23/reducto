The Mexico Equity and Income Fund, Inc.

                                                              September 27, 2004

DEAR FUND SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to present you with the audited financial statements of the
Mexico Equity and Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2004. The Fund presents investors with the opportunity to own Mexican
securities and its objective continues to be superior long-term performance.

The Fund's net assets were $33,779,149 on July 31, 2004, as compared to
$25,104,015 on July 31, 2003, which represents an increase of 34.56% in the
value of the Fund's net assets. From July 31, 2003 to July 31, 2004 the Fund's
Net Asset Value ("NAV") per share increased 34.77% (including reinvested
dividends). For the same period, the Bolsa IPC Index, which is a measure of the
market performance of Mexican securities, increased 28.98% (including reinvested
dividends).

As we have reported previously, your Board of Directors is focused on action to
control the discount at which the Fund's shares trade. To this end, we continue
to pursue the necessary regulatory approvals for the registration and listing of
put warrants that we propose to issue to our shareholders. These warrants are
intended to enable shareholders to receive NAV from time to time, if they decide
to sell their shares. We are hopeful that this process will be concluded before
the end of this year. However, there can be no assurance when (or if) such
approvals will be obtained. We will continue to keep you informed on this
matter.

As we have previously stated, it is our belief that if the Fund is able to issue
put warrants, the discount at which the Fund's common stock trades relative to
its NAV will be permanently reduced. Once the discount is under control, your
Board of Directors will consider measures to increase the asset base of the Fund
in order to reduce the expense ratio, which continues to be too high.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we thank you for your continued support of
the Fund. If you have any questions, please call our toll-fee number (866)
700-6104.

Sincerely yours,

/s/ Gerald Hellerman
Gerald Hellerman
President

                                                                               1

Report of the Investment Adviser

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2004

Dear Fund Shareholder,

We are pleased to provide you with the report of the Investment Adviser of The
Mexico Equity and Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2004.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEXICO'S ECONOMY: REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Mexico's macro fundamentals remain solid, with tight fiscal and monetary
discipline. Record high international reserves, ongoing growth in exports and
the positive effect on the current account of higher-than-expected oil prices,
as well as interest rates and CPI figure reductions in recent years (in both
real and nominal terms) are a solid and important economic platform for
consistent annual economic growth rates of between 5-7% upon the approval of
additional fiscal and energy structural reforms.

Banco de Mexico's successful monetary policy is reflected in a 28-day Cetes
(Mexican Treasury Bill) rate of 7.10% currently and an annual CPI rate of 4.49%
through July 31, 2004 compared with interest rate levels of 32% in 1998 and 16%
in 2000 when annual inflation rates were 18% and 9% for the same two years,
respectively.

The unemployment rate and higher economic growth rates are the two lagging
elements of Mexico's successful macroeconomic model. A decrease in productivity
gains constitutes the latent challenge for President Fox's administration.
Long-awaited fiscal, labor and energy reforms that would boost Mexico's
competitiveness and favor long-term investments, were not forthcoming during the
fiscal year.

Banco de Mexico published its survey of private analysts with the following
projections for the remainder of 2004: (i) CPI estimates rose to 4.33% from
4.08% in June, (ii) expectations for year-end 28-day Cetes rose to 7.35% from
7.14% in June, (iii) the Mexican Peso is expected to close the year at MXP$11.56
against the U.S. Dollar, and (iv) GDP growth is now forecasted to be 4.09% vs.
3.93% in June.

FUND UPDATES
The Fund's toll-free phone number is (866) 700-6104.
TRACKING THE FUND'S NAV
The Fund's net asset value (NAV) is calculated daily and published in The Wall
Street Journal every Monday under the heading "Closed End Funds." The Fund's net
asset value is also published in Barron's on Saturdays and in The New York Times
on Mondays. The Fund is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker
symbol MXE.

THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MEXICAN STOCK EXCHANGE

For the year ended July 31, 2004, the Mexico Bolsa IPC Index (the "Bolsa")
gained 27.7% (simple price appreciation), marked by two distinct periods:

     1. From August 2003 to March 2004, the Bolsa gained 35.5% underpinned by
        low interest rates, an upturn in the global commodities cycle, and
        confirmation of an economic recovery, and

     2. From April 2004 to July 2004 the Bolsa lost -5.7% with a sharp bout of
        volatility due to higher international oil prices and the beginning of a
        rising interest rate cycle.

In general, outperforming sectors for the fiscal year were: mining (copper),
wireless telephonics, construction (housing development), and industrial
conglomerates (steel). Beverages, fixed-line telephonics and consumer staples
were the biggest underperforming sectors.

The Bolsa ranked fifth in the Latin American regions, trailing the Brazil
Bovespa Index's return of 61.3%, Peru Lima General Index's return of 55.1%,
Columbia IGBC General Index's return of 52.6% and the Venezuelan Indice Bursatil
de Caracas' return of 51.9%. By comparison, for the year ended July 31, 2004,
the Dow Jones gained 9.8% and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 8.8%.

Second quarter 2004 corporate results were better than expected with an EBITDA
growth rate of 20% versus the previous calendar year.

At the end of the Fund's fiscal year, the Bolsa was trading at 7.4x its 12 month
trailing EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization), which is in line with its three-year average and
at a 6% premium to its one-year average.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE

For the year ended July 31, 2004, the Fund's Net Asset Value ("NAV") gained
34.8%, outperforming the Bolsa's gain of 29% and The Mexico Fund (MXF), whose
NAV increased 34.3% during the same period (both returns include reinvested
dividends).

For the ten-year period ended July 31, 2004, the Fund's cumulative NAV return
was 62.6%, the MXF's cumulative NAV return was 7.7% and the Bolsa's cumulative
return was 38.3% (including reinvested dividends). Return calculations are
according to Bloomberg. The Bolsa is an equity-only index while the Mexico
Equity and Income Fund Inc. invests in equity and fixed-income instruments. For
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, the Fund's common share market price gained

 4

                                         THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

29.1% (including reinvested dividends). Thus, for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2004 the Fund continued to achieve one of the best returns compared to its
peers. The Fund's common shares ended July at a 14.1% discount to NAV, 384 basis
points greater than at July of 2003.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY

The Fund's investment strategy included a mix of investments with an allocation
of 91% in stocks and 9% in other investments for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2004. We believe that the Fund outperformed the Bolsa primarily as the result of
a consistent strategy that included stocks classified in the
undervalued-restructuring stories asset category in the Portfolio, which turned
out to be the largest contributor to the Fund's performance for the period.

The three main asset categories that prevailed in the Fund throughout the fiscal
period were:

     (i) strong market positions, (ii) undervalued-restructuring stories, and
     (iii) fast-growing business segments. The asset classification methodology
     was established in 2001, and includes three additional asset categories:
     (i) financial institutions, (ii) global leaders and (iii) globally
     consolidated industries.

During the fiscal year 2004, the fixed income allocation averaged approximately
6% on a monthly basis, the lowest allocation compared to 17% in 2003, 11% in
2002, and 9% in 2001.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

Solid monetary and fiscal discipline has helped to maintain Mexico's country
risk within an approximate range of 220 to184 basis points, the lowest level in
15 years. In the long term, the failure to approve long-awaited structural
reforms could jeopardize the country's competitiveness. Strong second quarter
2004 financial reports improved the Bolsa's EV/EBITDA multiple to 6.8x from
7.7x. We believe that higher international oil prices and geopolitical issues
limited the Bolsa's upside.

We will continue to implement a prudent investment strategy that includes
fixed-income investments and equity allocations with a focus on: (i)
internationally competitive Mexican Blue Chip companies which are characterized
by high market share, quality management, and strong balance sheets, (ii)
undervalued stocks which are in special situations, but have solid management
and strong products and (iii) small capitalization stocks with strong EBITDA
growth, with a positive outlook that stand to benefit the Fund in the long term.

                                                                               5

THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

On the political front, Mr. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico City's mayor and
a strong left-wing candidate for the July 2006 presidential seat, could possibly
be stripped of his political immunity. If this were to happen, it could be a
source of political turmoil in the months to come.

We will continue to adhere to our investment strategy illustrated by the
following two investment principles: consistency and strong risk-control
measures to avoid excessive exposure to uncertainties.

THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

Notes to Financial Statements                                      JULY 31, 2004

NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Mexico Equity and Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in
Maryland on May 24, 1990, and commenced operations on August 21, 1990. The Fund
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
PORTFOLIO VALUATION. Investments are stated at value in the accompanying
financial statements. All securities for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the last sales price prior to the time of determination
of net asset value, or, if no sales price is available at that time, at the
closing price last quoted for the securities (but if bid and asked quotations
are available, at the mean between the current bid and asked prices, rather than
the quoted closing price). Securities that are traded over-the-counter are
valued, if bid and asked quotations are available, at the mean between the
current bid and asked prices. Investments in short-term debt securities having a
maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost if their term to
maturity from the date of purchase was less than 60 days, or by amortizing their
value on the 61st day prior to maturity if their term to maturity from the date
of purchase when acquired by the Fund was more than 60 days. Other assets and
securities for which no quotations are readily available will be valued in good
faith at fair value using methods determined by the Board of Directors. At July
31, 2004, the Fund held three such securities which represented 2.44% of the
Fund's net assets.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. The cost of investments sold is
determined by use of the specific identification method for both financial
reporting and income tax purposes. Interest income, including the accretion of
discount and amortization of premium on investments, is recorded on an accrual
basis; dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or, using reasonable
diligence, when known to the Fund. The collectibility of income receivable from
foreign securities is evaluated periodically, and any resulting allowances for
uncollectible amounts are reflected currently in the determination of investment
income.

TAX STATUS. No provision is made for U.S. Federal income or excise taxes as it
is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to make the requisite distributions to its shareholders that will be
sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all U.S.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
                                                                   JULY 31, 2004

                                         THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

Federal income and excise taxes. At July 31, 2004, the Fund had capital loss
carryovers of $2,727,479 expiring July 31, 2011, which are available to offset
future net realized gains on securities transactions to the extent provided for
in the Internal Revenue Code.

In accordance with U.S. Treasury regulations, the Fund utilized $1,069,636 of
capital losses and $21,901 of Post-October currency losses arising after October
31, 2002. Such losses are treated for tax purposes as arising on August 1, 2003.

The Fund is subject to the following withholding taxes on income from Mexican
sources:

     Dividends distributed by Mexican companies are subject to withholding tax
     at an effective rate of 0.00%. Prior to January 1, 2002, the effective rate
     was 7.69%.

     Interest income on debt issued by the Mexican federal government is
     generally not subject to withholding. Withholding tax on interest from
     other debt obligations such as publicly traded bonds and loans by banks or
     insurance companies is at a rate of 4.9% under the tax treaty between
     Mexico and the United States.

     Gains realized from the sale or disposition of debt securities may be
     subject to a 4.9% withholding tax. Gains realized by the Fund from the sale
     or disposition of equity securities that are listed and traded on the
     Mexican Stock Exchange ("MSE") are exempt from Mexican withholding tax if
     sold through the stock exchange. Gains realized on transactions outside of
     the MSE may be subject to withholding at a rate of 25% (20% rate prior to
     January 1, 2002) of the value of the shares sold or, upon the election of
     the Fund, at 35% (40% rate prior to January 1, 2002) of the gain. If the
     Fund has owned less than 25% of the outstanding stock of the issuer of the
     equity securities within the 12 month period preceding the disposition,
     then such disposition will not be subject to capital gains taxes as
     provided for in the treaty to avoid double taxation between Mexico and the
     United States.

RECLASSIFICATION OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. The Fund accounts and reports for
distributions to shareholders in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 93-2; Determination,
Disclosure and Financial Statement Presentation of Income, Capital, and Return
of Capital Distributions by Investment Companies. For the year ended July 31,
2004, the Fund increased undistributed net investment income by $63,437,
decreased accumulated net realized loss on investments by $27,445 and decreased
paid-in capital by $90,882 due to the tax treatment of foreign currency gains
and losses.

                                                                              17

THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (i) market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
     current Mexican peso exchange rate on the valuation date, and

     (ii) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
     the Mexican peso exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates of such
     transactions.

The Fund does not generally isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates from the effect of fluctuations in the market prices of
securities. The Fund does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency
rates, however, when determining the gain or loss upon the sale of foreign
currency denominated debt obligations pursuant to U.S. Federal income tax
regulations; such amounts are categorized as foreign exchange gain or loss for
income tax reporting purposes.

The Fund reports realized foreign exchange gains and losses on all other foreign
currency related transactions as components of realized gains and losses for
financial reporting purposes, whereas such gains and losses are treated as
ordinary income or loss for Federal income tax purposes.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate. Foreign
security and currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks
not typically associated with those of domestic origin as a result of, among
other factors, the level of governmental supervision and regulation of foreign
securities markets and the possibilities of political or economic instability.

DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS. The Fund intends to distribute to
shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its net investment income,
including foreign currency gains. The Fund also intends to normally distribute
annually any net realized capital gains in excess of net realized capital losses
(including any capital loss carryovers), except in circumstances where the
Directors of the Fund determine that the decrease in the size of the Fund's
assets resulting from the distribution of the gains would generally not be in
the interest of the Fund's shareholders. An additional distribution may be made
to the extent necessary to avoid payment of a 4% U.S. Federal excise tax.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount
of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized gains
are determined in accordance with U.S. Federal income tax regulations, which may
differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are

reclassified within the capital accounts based on their Federal tax-basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification. Dividends and
distributions which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for financial reporting purposes but not for tax purposes are reported as
dividends in excess of net investment income and net realized capital gains,
respectively. To the extent they exceed net investment income and net realized
gains for tax purposes, they are reported as distributions of additional paid-in
capital.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. The tax character of distributions paid to
shareholders during the years ended July 31, 2004 and July 31, 2003 were as

fee of $5,000 plus $700 for each Board of Directors meeting attended in person
and $100 for each special telephonic meeting attended. At the Board of
Directors' meeting held on December 13, 2001, Mr. Gerald Hellerman was appointed
President of the Fund. For serving the Fund as President, in addition to the
aforementioned Directors' fees, Mr. Hellerman receives annual compensation in
the amount of $6,000. In addition, the Fund reimburses the directors for travel
and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Board of Directors'
meetings.

U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC ("USBFS"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of U.S. Bancorp, serves as the Fund's Administrator and, in that capacity,
performs various administrative and accounting services for the Fund. USBFS also
serves as the Fund's Fund Accountant (the "Fund Accountant"). U.S. Bank, N.A.

NOTE C: PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY
Purchases and sales of securities other than short-term obligations, aggregated
$70,572,396 and $71,714,585 respectively, for the year ended July 31, 2004.

At July 31, 2004 substantially all of the Fund's assets were invested in Mexican
securities. The Mexican securities markets are substantially smaller, less
liquid, and more volatile than the major securities markets in the United
States. Consequently, acquisitions and dispositions of securities by the Fund
may be limited.

NOTE D: CAPITAL STOCK
At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 13, 2001, the Board of
Directors approved a tender offer (the "Tender").

The Tender allowed the Fund to purchase up to 100% of each shareholder's shares
of common stock, not to exceed 80% of the total outstanding shares of common
stock of the Fund, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the Fund's net asset
value per share as of the closing date. The Tender commenced on February 19,
2002 and expired on March 20, 2002. In connection with the Tender, the Fund
purchased 6,122,069 shares of capital stock at a total cost of $68,444,728.
There were no gains or losses to the Fund because the repurchase of tendered
shares was executed at 100% of the Fund's NAV as calculated on the expiration
date.

At a special meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 11, 1999, the
Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Pursuant to the share
repurchase program, the Fund was

authorized to commence a two phase share repurchase program for up to 2,800,000
shares, or approximately 25% of the Fund's then outstanding shares of common
stock, through a combination of share purchases and tender offers.

During the years ended July 31, 2004, July 31, 2003 and July 31, 2002, the Fund
made no repurchases pursuant to the program. Pursuant to the share repurchase
program, during the year ended July 31, 2001, the Fund purchased 174,000 shares
of capital stock in the open market at a total cost of $1,703,552. The weighted
average discount of these purchases comparing the purchase price to the net
asset value at the time of purchase was 9.01%. During the fiscal year ended July
31, 2000, the Fund purchased 1,199,700 shares of capital stock in the open
market at a total cost of $10,573,159. The weighted average discount of these
purchases comparing the purchase prices to the net asset value at the time of
purchase was 16.40%.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Mexico
Equity and Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of
investments, as of July 31, 2004, and the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
three years in the period then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits. For years prior to August 1, 2001, the financial highlights were audited
by other auditors whose report, dated September 20, 2001, expressed an
unqualified opinion.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of July 31, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mexico
Equity and Income Fund, Inc. as of July 31, 2004, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the three
years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

Dividends and Distributions (unaudited)                            JULY 31, 2004

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund intends to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its net
investment company taxable income at least annually. Investment company taxable
income, as defined in section 852 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986,
includes all of the Fund's taxable income minus the excess, if any, of its net
realized long-term capital gains over its net realized short-term capital losses
(including any capital loss carryovers), plus or minus certain other required
adjustments. The Fund also expects to distribute annually substantially all of
its net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term
capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), except in circumstances
where the Fund realizes very large capital gains and where the Directors of the
Fund determine that the decrease in the size of the Fund's assets resulting from
the distribution of the gains would not be in the interest of the Fund's
shareholders generally.

Pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), each shareholder
will be deemed to have elected, unless the Plan Agent (as defined below) is
otherwise instructed by the shareholder in writing, to have all distributions,
net of any applicable U.S. withholding tax, automatically reinvested in
additional shares of the Fund by Computershare Trust Company, Inc., the Fund's
transfer agent, as the Plan Agent (the "Plan Agent"). Shareholders who do not
participate in the Plan will receive all dividends and distributions in cash,
net of any applicable U.S. withholding tax, paid in U.S. dollars by check mailed
directly to the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as dividend-paying agent.
Shareholders who do not wish to have dividends and distributions automatically
reinvested should notify the Plan Agent for The Mexico Equity and Income Fund,
Inc., c/o Computershare Investor Services, ATTN: Mr. Charles Zade, 2 North La
Salle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602. Dividends and distributions with respect
to shares of the Fund's Common Stock registered in the name of a broker-dealer
or other nominee (i.e., in "street name") will be reinvested under the Plan
unless the service is not provided by the broker or nominee or the shareholder
elects to receive dividends and distributions in cash. A shareholder whose
shares are held by a broker or nominee that does not provide a dividend
reinvestment program may be required to have his shares registered in his own
name to participate in the Plan. Investors who own shares of the Fund's Common
Stock registered in street name should contact the broker or nominee for
details.

The Plan Agent serves as agent for the shareholders in administering the Plan.
If the Directors of the Fund declare an income dividend or a capital gains
distribution payable either in the Fund's Common Stock or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, nonparticipants in the Plan will receive cash and
participants in the Plan will receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund. If
the market price per share on the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset
value per share on that date, the Fund will issue new shares to participants at
net asset value; or, if the net asset value is less than

Dividends and Distributions (unaudited) (continued)                JULY 31, 2004

                                         THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

95% of the market price on the valuation date, then such shares will be issued
at 95% of the market price.

If net asset value per share on the valuation date exceeds the market price per
share on that date, participants in the Plan will receive shares of Common Stock
from the Fund valued at market price. The valuation date is the dividend or
distribution payment date or, if that date is not a New York Stock Exchange
trading day, the next preceding trading day. If the Fund should declare an
income dividend or capital gains distribution payable only in cash, the Plan
Agent will, as agent for the participants, buy Fund shares in the open market on
the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts on, or
shortly after, the payment date.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmations of all transactions in an account, including information
needed by shareholders for personal and tax records. Shares in the account of
each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Agent in noncertified form in the
name of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased pursuant to the Plan.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees that hold shares
for others who are beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on
the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the
shareholders as representing the total amount registered in the shareholder's
name and held for the account of beneficial owners who participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gains
distributions payable in either Common Stock or cash. The Plan Agent's fees for
the handling or reinvestment of such dividends and capital gains distributions
will be paid by the Fund. There will be no brokerage charges with respect to
shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains
distributions payable either in stock or in cash. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
or capital gains distributions payable in cash.

Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts of Common Stock for individual
accounts through the Plan are expected to be less than usual brokerage charges
for such transactions because the Plan Agent will be purchasing stock for all
participants in blocks and prorating the lower commissions thus attainable.
Brokerage commissions will vary based on, among other things, the broker
selected to effect a particular purchase and the number of participants on whose
behalf such purchase is being made.

                                                                              25

Dividends and Distributions (unaudited) (continued)                JULY 31, 2004

THE MEXICO EQUITY AND INCOME FUND, INC.

The receipt of dividends and distributions in Common Stock under the Plan will
not relieve participants of any income tax (including withholding tax) that may
be payable on such dividends or distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes in the Plan are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan
as applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to notice of the
termination sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for
such dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended by the Fund or the
Plan Agent, but (except when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable
law, or rules or policies of a regulatory authority) only upon at least 30 days'
written notice to participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Plan Agent at the address above.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

The registrant has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer. The registrant has
not made any amendments to its code of ethics during the covered period. The
registrant has not granted any waivers from any provisions of the code of ethics
during the covered period. The registrant undertakes to provide to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of its code of ethics by mail when they
call the registrant at 1-414-765-5307.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's board of directors has determined that it does not have an
audit committee financial expert serving on its audit committee. At this time,
the registrant believes that the experience provided by each member of the audit
committee together offers the registrant adequate oversight for the registrant's
level of financial complexity.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

The registrant has engaged its principal accountant to perform audit services,
audit-related services, tax services and other services during the past two
fiscal years. "Audit services" refer to performing an audit of the registrant's
annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the
accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements
for those fiscal years. "Audit-related services" refer to the assurance and
related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the
performance of the audit. "Tax services" refer to professional services rendered
by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.
"Other services" were not provided by the principal accountant. The following
table details the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years
for audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees and other fees by the principal
accountant.

All Other Fees                      0                    0
</TABLE>


The audit committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures that
require the audit committee to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services of
the registrant, including services provided to any entity affiliated with the
registrant. All of the principal accountant's hours spent on auditing the
registrant's financial statements were attributed to work performed by full-time
permanent employees of the principal accountant.

The following table indicates the non-audit fees billed by the registrant's
accountant for services to the registrant and to the registrant's investment
adviser (and any other controlling entity, etc.--not sub-adviser) for the last
two years. The audit committee of the board of trustees/directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were

<PAGE>

rendered to the registrant's investment adviser is compatible with maintaining
the principal accountant's independence and has concluded that the provision of
such non-audit services by the accountant has not compromised the accountant's
independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Effective March 24, 2004, the standing audit committee is comprised of Mr.
Andrew Dakos, Mr. Phillip Goldstein, and Mr. Rajeev Das.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Schedule of Investments is included as part of the report to shareholders filed
under Item 1 of this Form.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND GUIDELINES

         The Proxy Voting Policies and Guidelines contained in this document
summarize The Mexico Equity and Income Fund, Inc.'s (the "Fund") positions on
various issues of concern to the Fund's shareholders. These Guidelines give
general indication as to how the Fund's Advisor will vote Fund shares on each
issue listed. However, this listing does not address all potential voting issues
or the intricacies that may surround individual proxy votes. For that reason
there may be instances in which votes may vary from the guidelines presented
here. The Fund endeavors to vote Fund shares in accordance with the Fund's
investment objectives and strategies.

         The Fund will vote NO on any proposals that would limit or restrict a
shareholders rights.

I.       CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

A.       BOARD AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES

     1.  BOARD OF DIRECTOR/TRUSTEE COMPOSITION

     The Board of Directors is responsible for the overall governance of the
corporation.

     The Fund advisor will OPPOSE slates without at least a majority of
independent directors (1/3 of directors who are outsiders to the corporation).

     The Fund advisor will vote FOR shareholder proposals that request that the
board audit, compensation and/or nominating committees include independent
directors exclusively.

     2.  INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

     The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT the authorization of additional
common stock necessary to facilitate a stock split.


                                       2
<PAGE>

     The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT the authorization of additional
common stock, if the company already has a large amount of stock authorized but
not issued or reserved for its stock option plans. In this latter instance,
there is a concern that the authorized but unissued shares will be used as a
poison pill or other takeover defense, which will be OPPOSED. In addition, we
will require the company to provide a specific purpose for any request to
increase shares by more than 100 percent of the current authorization.

     3.  BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

     Blank check preferred is stock with a fixed dividend and a preferential
claim on company assets relative to common shares. The terms of the stock
(voting dividend and conversion rights) are set by the Board at a future date
without further shareholder action. While such an issue can in theory have
legitimate corporate purposes, most often it has been used as a takeover defense
since the stock has terms that make the entire company less attractive.

     The Fund advisor will generally OPPOSE the creation of blank check
preferred stock.



                                       3
<PAGE>


4.       CLASSIFIED OR "STAGGERED" BOARD

         On a classified (or staggered) board, directors are divided into
separate classes (usually three) with directors in each class elected to
overlapping three-year terms. Companies argue that such Boards offer continuity
in direction which promotes long-term planning. However, in some instances they
may serve to deter unwanted takeovers since a potential buyer would have to wait
at least two years to gain a majority of Board seats.

         The Fund advisor will vote no on proposals involving classified boards.

5.       SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

         Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws
require a level of voting approval in excess of a simple majority. Generally,
supermajority provisions require at least 2/3 affirmative vote for passage of
issues.

     The Fund advisor will vote no on proposals involving supermajority voting.

6.       RESTRICTIONS ON SHAREHOLDERS TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

         Written consent allows shareholders to initiate and carry out a
shareholder action without waiting until the annual meeting or by calling a
special meeting. It permits action to be taken by the written consent of the
same percentage of outstanding shares that would be required to effect the
proposed action at a shareholder meeting.

         The Fund advisor will vote no on proposals to limit or eliminate the
right of shareholders to act by written consent.

7.       RESTRICTIONS ON SHAREHOLDERS TO CALL MEETINGS

         The Fund advisor will generally OPPOSE such a restriction as it limits
the right of the shareholder.

8.       LIMITATIONS, DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

         Because of increased litigation brought against directors of
corporations and the increased costs of director's liability insurance, many
states have passed laws limiting director liability for those acting in good
faith. Shareholders however must opt into such statutes. In addition, many
companies are seeking to add indemnification of directors to corporate bylaws.

         The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT director liability and
indemnification resolutions because it is important for companies to be able to
attract the most qualified individuals to their Boards. Note: Those directors
acting fraudulently would remain liable for their actions irrespective of this
resolution.

9.       REINCORPORATION

         Corporations are in general bound by the laws of the state in which
they are incorporated. Companies reincorporate for a variety of reasons
including shifting incorporation to a state where the company has its most
active operations or corporate headquarters, or shifting incorporation to take
advantage of state corporate takeover laws.

         While each reincorporation proposal will be evaluated based on its own
merits, the Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT reincorporation resolutions for
valid business reasons (such as reincorporating in the same state as the
corporate headquarters).


                                       4

10.      CUMULATIVE VOTING

         Cumulative voting allows shareholders to "stack" their votes behind one
or a few directors running for the board, thereby helping a minority of
shareholders to win board representation. Cumulative voting gives minority
shareholders a voice in corporate affairs proportionate to their actual strength
in voting shares.

         The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT proposals calling for
cumulative voting in the election of directors.

11.      DUAL CLASSES OF STOCK

         In order to maintain corporate control in the hands of a certain group
of shareholders, companies may seek to create multiple classes of stock with
differing rights pertaining to voting and dividends.

         The Fund advisor will generally OPPOSE dual classes of stock. However,
the advisor will SUPPORT classes of stock offering different dividend rights
(such as one class which pays cash dividends and a second which pays stock
dividends) depending on the circumstances.

12.      LIMIT DIRECTORS' TENURE

         In general corporate directors may stand for re-election indefinitely.
Opponents of this practice suggest that limited tenure would inject new
perspectives into the boardroom as well as possibly creating room for directors
from diverse backgrounds; however, continuity is important to corporate
leadership and in some instances alternative means may be explored for injecting
new ideas or members from diverse backgrounds into corporate boardrooms.

         Accordingly, the Fund advisor will vote on a case-by-case basis
attempts to limit director tenure.

13.      MINIMUM DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP

         The director share ownership proposal requires that all corporate
directors own a minimum number of shares in the corporation. The purpose of this
resolution is to encourage directors to have the same interest as other
shareholders.

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT resolutions that require corporate
directors to own shares in the company.

14.      SELECTION OF AUDITOR

         Annual election of the outside accountants is standard practice. While
it is recognized that the company is in the best position to evaluate the
competence of the outside accountants, we believe that outside accountants must
ultimately be accountable to shareholders. Furthermore, audit committees have
been the subject of a report released by the Blue Ribbon Commission on Improving
the Effectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees in conjunction with the NYSE and
the National Association of Securities Dealers. The Blue Ribbon Commission
concluded that audit committees must improve their current level of oversight of
independent accountants. Given the rash of accounting irregularities that were
not detected by audit panels or auditors, shareholder ratification is an
essential step in restoring investor confidence.

         The Fund advisor will OPPOSE the resolutions seeking ratification of
the auditor when fees for financial systems design and implementation exceed
audit and all other fees, as this can compromise the independence of the
auditor.


                                       5
<PAGE>

         The Fund advisor will OPPOSE the election of the audit committee chair
if the audit committee recommends an auditors whose fees for financial systems
design and implementation exceed audit and all other fees, as this can
compromise the independence of the auditor.

B.       EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

1.       DISCLOSURE OF CEO, EXECUTIVE, BOARD AND MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION

         On a case-by-case basis, the Fund advisor will SUPPORT shareholder
resolutions requesting companies to disclose the salaries of top management and
the Board of Directors.

2.       COMPENSATION FOR CEO, EXECUTIVE, BOARD AND MANAGEMENT

         The Fund advisor will OPPOSE an executive compensation proposal if we
believe the compensation does not reflect the economic and social circumstances
of the company (i.e. at times of layoffs, downsizing, employee wage freezes,
etc.).

3.       FORMATION AND INDEPENDENCE OF COMPENSATION REVIEW COMMITTEE

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT shareholder resolutions requesting the
formation of a committee of independent directors to review and examine
executive compensation.

4.       STOCK OPTIONS FOR BOARD AND EXECUTIVES

         The Fund advisor will generally OPPOSE stock option plans that in total
offer greater than 15% of shares outstanding because of voting and earnings
dilution.

         The Fund advisor will generally OPPOSE option programs that allow the
repricing of underwater options. (Repricing divides shareholder and employee
interests. Shareholders cannot "reprice" their stock and, therefore, optionees
should not be treated differently).

         The Fund advisor will generally OPPOSE stock option plans that have
option exercise prices below the marketplace on the day of the grant.

         The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT options programs for outside
directors subject to the same constraints previously described.

5.       EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOPS)

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT ESOPs created to promote active employee
ownership. However, they will OPPOSE any ESOP whose purpose is to prevent a
corporate takeover.

6.       PAY EQUITY

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT shareholder resolutions that request that
management provide a race and/or gender pay equity report.

7.       RATIO BETWEEN CEO AND WORKER PAY

         The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT shareholder resolutions
requesting that management report on the ratio between CEO and employee
compensation.


                                       6
<PAGE>

8.       MAXIMUM RATIO BETWEEN CEO AND WORKER COMPENSATION AND/OR CAP ON CEO
         COMPENSATION

         The Fund advisor will vote on a case-by-case basis shareholder
resolutions requesting management to set a maximum ratio between CEO and
employee compensation and/or a cap on CEO compensation.

9.       CHANGES TO CHARTER OR BY-LAWS

         The Fund advisor will conduct a case-by-case review of the proposed
changes with the voting decision resting on whether the proposed changes are in
shareholder's best interests.

10.      CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

         Typically, proxy voting differs from voting in political elections in
that the company is made aware of shareholder votes as they are cast. This
enables management to contact dissenting shareholders in an attempt to get them
to change their votes.

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT confidential voting because the voting
process should be free of coercion.

11.      EQUAL ACCESS TO PROXY

         Equal access proposals ask companies to give shareholders access to
proxy materials to state their views on contested issues, including director
nominations. In some cases, they would actually allow shareholders to nominate
directors. Companies suggest that such proposals would make an increasingly
complex process even more burdensome.

         In general, the Fund advisor will OPPOSE resolutions for equal access
proposals.

12.      GOLDEN PARACHUTES

         Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are
terminated or demoted pursuant to a takeover. Companies argue that such
provisions are necessary to keep executives from "jumping ship" during potential
takeover attempts.

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT the right of shareholders to vote on
golden parachutes because they go above and beyond ordinary compensation
practices. In evaluating a particular golden parachute, we will examine total
management compensation, the employees covered by the plan, and the quality of
management.

C.       MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

1.       CONSIDERING THE NON-FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER PROPOSAL

         Such a proposal allows or requires the Board to consider the impact of
merger decisions on various "stakeholders," such as employees, communities,
customers and business partners. This proposal gives the Board the right to
reject a tender offer on the grounds that it would adversely affect the
company's stakeholders.

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT shareholder resolutions that consider
non-financial impacts of mergers.

2.       MERGERS, RESTRUCTURING AND SPIN-OFFS


                                       7
<PAGE>

         A merger, restructuring, or spin-off in some way affects a change in
control of the company's assets. In evaluating the merit of each issue, we will
consider the terms of each proposal. This will include an analysis of the
potential long-term value of the investment.

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT management proposals for merger or
restructuring if the transaction appears to offer fair value and other proxy
voting policies stated are not violated. For example, the advisor may oppose
restructuring resolution which include in it significant takeover defenses and
may again oppose the merger of a non-nuclear and a nuclear utility if it poses
potential liabilities.

3.       POISON PILLS

         Poison pills (or shareholder rights plans) are triggered by an unwanted
takeover attempt and cause a variety of events to occur which may make the
company financially less attractive to the suitor. Typically, directors have
enacted these plans without shareholder approval. Most poison pill resolutions
deal with putting poison pills up for a vote or repealing them altogether.

         The Fund advisor will SUPPORT proposals to put rights plans up for a
shareholder vote. In general, poison pills will be OPPOSED unless management is
able to present a convincing case fur such a plan.

4.       OPT-OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

         A strategy for dealing with anti-takeover issues has been a shareholder
resolution asking for a company to opt-out of a particular state's anti-takeover
laws.

         The Fund advisor will generally SUPPORT bylaws changes requiring a
company to opt-out of state anti-takeover laws. However, resolutions requiring
companies to opt-into state anti-takeover statutes will be OPPOSED.

                                 CERTIFICATIONS

I, Gerald Hellerman, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The Mexico Equity and Income
     Fund, Inc.;

     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial

     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the

     a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
         material information relating to the registrant, including its

     a)  all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
         controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to

         internal controls; and

     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.
