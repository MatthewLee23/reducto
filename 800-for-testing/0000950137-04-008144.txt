The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2004

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust is managed by the Adviser's Senior Loans team,
led by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director of the Adviser.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 was a highly favorable period for the
senior-loan market. Strong fundamental factors worked in the market's favor:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth topped 4 percent at an annual rate for three
of the last four calendar quarters, inflation remained in check, and interest
rates finally began to rise in early 2004. As the economy continued to improve,
so too did corporate financial performance. Over the past few years, companies
have had to become much more efficient in order to thrive in an era of lower
prices and greater competition. Companies' gains in efficiency have led to
considerable operating leverage, which has helped boost profits. These factors,
coupled with improving credit quality and rising productivity, all contributed
to the senior loan market's strong performance during the period.

Yield spreads in the senior-loan market (the yield differential between senior
loans and short-term lending rates, such as LIBOR) continued to contract,
reaching near-historic lows by the end of the reporting period. This narrowing
of spreads enabled more companies to access the senior-loan market at very
favorable terms. At the same time, demand for and inflows into senior loans
continued to rise, particularly from institutional investors, as the asset class
has gained growing recognition as a defensive investment. Significantly lower
default rates also added to the attractiveness of the senior-loan market. As a
result, investors readily absorbed the record amounts of new issues that came to
market during the period, and demand and supply remained in equilibrium.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

A closed-end fund's return can be calculated upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns

can differ significantly, as they did during the reporting period. For the 12-
months ended July 31, 2004, the trust returned 18.13 percent on a market-price
basis, and 11.62 percent on an NAV basis.

We believe that the trust's strong performance is the result, in part, of our
successfully working through the more challenging credits of the past--a process
that can take up to two years to complete. It is also a reflection of our
larger, experienced team of analysts and the thorough fundamental research they
conduct, which we believe has led to better investment decisions. We continue to
focus on identifying those companies that exhibit strong management, solid and
predictable cash flows, and collateral that is sufficient to provide a healthy
"second way out." This bottom-up security-selection process resulted in an
emphasis on the cable, printing and publishing, and health-care sectors during
the reporting period. We also identified some attractive opportunities in
telecommunications, and we added slightly to the portfolio's holdings in this
sector. The trust's allocation to hotels, motels and gaming also increased
during the reporting period. This industry has been strong this year as
consumers are generally traveling and spending more, and our analysis identified
issuers that offered compelling returns with strong asset coverage.

The trust also benefited during the period from our use of leverage. This
strategy involves borrowing at a short-term lending rate such as LIBOR and
reinvesting the proceeds at a spread above that rate. We use leverage on an
ongoing basis in an effort to enhance the trust's dividend, as it did during the
reporting period. Our strategy entails less interest-rate risks than that
inherent in more traditional leverage strategies, which involve borrowing at
short-term rates and lending at long-term rates.

In an effort to limit risk, we continued to keep the trust broadly diversified,
which helps enhance the portfolio's defensive characteristics. In addition,
while we do not practice sector selection, we do avoid certain industries that
have historically been poor performers in the senior-loan arena, such as fashion
and retail.

Looking ahead, while growth in corporate profits may level off, we believe that
absolute profitability and pricing power are likely to remain strong and that
companies will be able to continue to generate free cash flow. For these
reasons, we believe the environment for senior loans should continue to be quite
favorable in the coming months. We will continue with our disciplined investment
approach, seeking a relatively stable net asset value for the trust and
attractive yields.

INVESTMENT POLICY CHANGES

       At a meeting held on May 26, 2004, the Board of Trustees approved changes
       to certain of the Trust's investment policies in order to expand the
       investment options available to the Trust as the Trust seeks to achieve
       its investment objective of high level of current income, consistent with
       preservation of capital. The Trust's investment policy of investing at
       least 80% of its total assets in senior loans remains unchanged. The
       changes to the Trust's investment policies are as follows:

       1. The Trust may now invest up to 5% of its total assets in senior loans
       or other assets which are denominated in non-U.S. dollars;

       2. The Trust's investments in senior loans now may also include up to 5%
       of its total assets in senior debt obligations that are in the form of
       notes in addition to investments in loan agreements, participations and
       assignments;

       3. The Trust's investment policy of investing up to 20% of its total
       assets in warrants, equity securities and junior debt acquired in
       connection with the Trust's investments in senior loans has been expanded
       so that the Trust may invest up to 20% of its total assets in junior debt
       securities directly and not necessarily in connection with an investment
       in senior loans and the Trust may also invest in warrants and equity
       securities directly provided that the Trust must own or acquire a senior
       loan of the same issuer;

       4. The Trust's ability to invest up to 5% of its total assets in
       structured notes has been clarified to include credit-linked notes and
       other types of structured investments (referred to collectively as
       "structured products"). A structured note is a derivative security that
       has one or more special features, such as an interest rate based on a
       spread over an index or a benchmark interest rate or other reference
       indicator, that may or may not correlate to the total rate of return on
       one or more underlying investments (such as senior loan interests)
       referenced in such notes. A credit-linked note is a derivative instrument
       that is a synthetic obligation between two or more parties where the
       payment of principal and/or interest is based on the performance of some
       obligation (a reference obligation). Generally, investments in structured

 6
<PAGE>

       products are interests in entities organized and operated for the purpose
       of restructuring the investment characteristics of underlying investment
       interests or securities. This generally involves the deposit or purchase
       of the underlying investments (such as senior loan interests) and the
       issuance of one or more classes of securities backed by or representing
       interests in, the underlying investments or referencing an indicator
       related to such underlying investments. The cash flow or rate of return
       on the underlying investments may be apportioned among the newly issued
       classes of securities to create different investment characteristics,
       such as varying maturities, credit quality, payment priorities and
       interest rate provisions. The cash flow or rate of return on a structured
       product may be determined by applying a multiplier to the rate of total
       return on the underlying investments or referenced indicator. Application
       of a multiplier is comparable to the use of financial leverage, a
       speculative technique. Leverage magnifies the potential for gain or the
       risk of loss. As a result, a relatively small decline in the value of the
       underlying investments or referenced indicator could result in a
       relatively large loss in the value of the structured product. Holders of
       structured products bear risks of the underlying index or reference
       obligation and are subject to counterparty risk. Structured products
       where the rate of return is determined by reference to a Senior Loan will
       be treated as senior loans for the purposes of complying with the Trust's
       policy of normally investing at least 80% of its total assets in senior
       loans; and

       5. The Trust's ability to invest up to 20% of its total assets in high
       quality, short-term debt securities with remaining maturities of one year
       or less has been expanded so that the Trust may also invest in Treasury
       Inflation Protected Securities ("U.S. TIPS") and other inflation-indexed
       bonds issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities
       (and such U.S. TIPS and other inflation--indexed bonds may have any
       maturity). U.S. TIPS are fixed income securities issued by the U.S.
       Department of the Treasury, the principal amounts of which are adjusted
       daily based upon changes in the rate of inflation (currently represented
       by the non-seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index for All Urban
       Consumers. The Trust may purchase U.S. TIPS of other inflation-indexed
       bonds of any maturity. U.S. TIPS pay interest on a periodic basis, equal
       to a fixed interest rate applied to the inflation-indexed principal
       amount. The interest on these bonds is fixed at issuance, but over the
       life of the bond, this interest may be paid on an increasing or
       decreasing principal value that has been adjusted for inflation.
       Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for
       inflation) is guaranteed even during a period of deflation. However,
       because the principal amount of U.S. TIPS would be adjusted downward
       during a period of deflation, the Trust will be subject to deflation risk
       with respect to its investments in these securities. In addition, the
       current market value of the bonds is not guaranteed, and

                                                                               7
<PAGE>

       will fluctuate. If the Trust purchases U.S. TIPS in the secondary market
       whose principal values have been adjusted upward due to inflation since
       issuance, the Trust may experience a loss if there is a subsequent period
       of deflation. If inflation is lower than expected during the period the
       Trust holds a U.S. TIPS, the Trust may earn less on the security than on
       a conventional bond. The Trust may invest in inflation-indexed securities
       issued by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities with
       other structures or characteristics as such securities become available
       in the market.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. (Bank
    loan ratings are unaudited.)

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(e) Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(f) Restricted Security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.49%
    of the net assets of the Trust.

(g) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2004.

(i) A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    commitments.

(j) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(k) Payment-in-kind security.

(1) Subsequent to July 31, 2004, this borrower has emerged from bankruptcy.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for

   income to average net asset applicable to common shares by .01%. Net
   investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gains and losses

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of
current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust seeks to
achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of interests in
floating or variable rate senior loans to corporations, partnerships and other
entities which operate in a variety of industries and geographical regions. The
Trust borrows money for investment purposes which will create the opportunity
for enhanced return, but also should be considered a speculative technique and
may increase the Trust's volatility. The Trust commenced investment operations
on June 24, 1998. Effective November 30, 2003, the Trust's investment adviser,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. merged into its affiliate, Van Kampen Asset
Management.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans are valued by the Trust following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Trust's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate, interest rate
redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the
current interest rate, the period until next interest rate redetermination and
the maturity of such Senior Loan. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Trust's Valuation Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by

 36
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

the underlying debt security. The Trust will make payment for such securities
only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of
the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the
underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2004, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $209,217,198, which will expire between July 31, 2009 and
July 31, 2012.

    At July 31, 2004, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

<Table>

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

                                                                              37

    The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended July 31, 2004
and 2003 was as follows:

  Long-term capital gain....................................          -0-            -0-
                                                              -----------    -----------
                                                              $75,570,307    $79,888,289
                                                              ===========    ===========
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A permanent difference
related to book to tax amortization differences totaling $1,808,397 has been
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized loss. A permanent book and tax difference related to excise taxes
which are not deductible for tax purposes totaling $84,040 has been reclassified
to paid in surplus from accumulated undistributed net investment income.

    As of July 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $1,498,215
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions, other losses that were recognized for book purposes but not
tax purposes at the end of the fiscal year and post October losses which are not
realized for tax purposes until the first day of the following fiscal year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the year ended July 31, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $194,100 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of the Trust
is an affiliated person.

    Under a Legal Services agreement, the Adviser provides legal services to the
Trust. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to each Trust. For the
year ended July 31, 2004, the

 38
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

Trust recognized expenses of approximately $78,800 representing Van Kampen
Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing legal services to the Trust, which are reported as "Legal" expenses in
the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to deter all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable for a ten-year period
and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust. The maximum
annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

    During the period, the Trust owned shares of the following affiliated
companies. Affiliated companies are defined by the Investment Company Act of
1940 as those companies in which a fund holds 5% or more of the outstanding
voting securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

4. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Variable Rate Senior Loan agreements,
the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of approximately $133,470,400 as of July
31, 2004. The Trust intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by
segregating cash, liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a reserve.

5. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

    At July 31, 2004, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Trust on a participation
basis.

</Table>

6. BORROWINGS

As of April 29, 2004, the shareholders approved amending the Trust's fundamental
investment restriction regarding the Trust's use of financial leverage. The
Trust is now able to utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, a fund
generally may not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the fund's total
assets or (ii) issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the fund's total
assets. In using a combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares,
the maximum allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no
event more than 50%) of the Fund's total assets based on the relative amounts
borrowed or preferred shares issued.

    The Trust had entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of
the credit line. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the
Trust. For the year ended July 31, 2004, the average daily balance of borrowings
under the revolving credit agreement was $408,658,470 with a weighted average
interest rate of 1.18%.

7. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

As of February 20, 2004, the Trust issued 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series
T, Series W, Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"), $.01 Par
Value, $25,000 liquidation Preference, for a total issuance of $700 million. The
Trust used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down existing borrowings.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven
days through an auction process. The average rate in effect on

 40
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2004 continued

July 31, 2004 was 1.68%. During the year ended July 31, 2004, the rates ranged
from 1.030% to 1.890%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              41

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of July 31, 2004, the related statements of operations and cash
flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each
of the two years then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five
years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits. The Trust's financial highlights for the period ended prior
to July 31, 2000 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated September
14, 1999, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of July 31, 2004, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust as of July 31, 2004, the results of its operations,

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. Common Shareholders who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions of dividends and capital gains in cash paid by check mailed
directly to the Common Shareholder by the Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                                                                              43

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing State Street Bank and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive,
without charge, a share certificate issued in your name for all full Common
Shares credited to your account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made
for any fractional Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may
again elect to participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or
writing to the Trust at:

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

                          AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months

- ----------

(1)      This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), adopted as of the date above, supercedes
and replaces all prior versions that may have been adopted from time to time.

(2)      Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>
from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides
a different period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually
review and pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent
Auditors without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee. The
Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the list of general pre-approved
services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.


2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.


3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following Audit services. All
other Audit services not listed below must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated):
    -    Statutory audits or financial audits for the Fund
    -    Services associated with SEC registration statements (including new
         funds), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or
         other documents issued in connection with securities offerings (e.g.,
         comfort letters for closed-end fund offerings, consents), and
         assistance in responding to SEC comment letters
    -    Consultations by the Fund's management as to the accounting or
         disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or
         potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or
         interpretations by the SEC, FASB, or other regulatory or standard
         setting bodies (Note: Under SEC rules, some consultations may be "audit
         related" services rather than "audit" services)

<PAGE>

4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following Audit-related
services. All other Audit-related services not listed below must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated):
    -    Attest procedures not required by statute or regulation (including
         agreed upon procedures related to the Closed-End Fund asset coverage
         tests required by the rating agencies and/or lenders)
    -    Due diligence services pertaining to potential fund mergers
    -    Issuance of SAS-70 reports on internal controls of Morgan Stanley Trust
         Co. and MSIM Trade Operations
    -    Consultations by the Fund's management as to the accounting or
         disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or
         potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or
         interpretations by the SEC, FASB, or other regulatory or
         standard-setting bodies (Note: Under SEC rules, some consultations may
         be "audit" services rather than "audit-related" services)
    -    Information systems reviews not performed in connection with the audit
         (e.g., application data center and technical reviews)
    -    General assistance with implementation of the requirements of SEC rules
         or listing standards promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    -    Audit of record keeping services performed by Morgan Stanley Trust Fund
         related to the New Jersey State Retirement Plan


5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the following Tax Services. All Tax services involving large and
complex transactions not listed below must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any

<PAGE>
executive officer or trustee/director/managing general partner of the Fund, in
his or her individual capacity, where such services are paid for by the Fund
(generally applicable only to internally managed investment companies):

    -    U.S. federal, state and local tax planning and advice
    -    U.S. federal, state and local tax compliance
    -    International tax planning and advice
    -    International tax compliance
    -    Review of federal, state, local and international income, franchise,
         and other tax returns
    -    Identification of Passive Foreign Investment Companies
    -    Review of closed-end funds pro rata allocation of taxable income and
         capital gains to common and preferred shares.
    -    Domestic and foreign tax planning, compliance, and advice
    -    Assistance with tax audits and appeals before the IRS and similar
         state, local and foreign agencies
    -    Tax advice and assistance regarding statutory, regulatory or
         administrative developments (e.g., excise tax reviews, evaluation of
         Fund's tax compliance function)
    -    Review the calculations of taxable income from corporate actions
         including reorganizations related to bankruptcy filings and provide
         guidance related to the foregoing


6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following All Other services.
Permissible All Other services not listed below must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated):
    -    Risk management advisory services, e.g., assessment and testing of
         security infrastructure controls

         The following is a list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services. The
SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be consulted to determine the precise
definitions of these services and the applicability of exceptions to certain of
the prohibitions:
    -    Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
         financial statements of the audit client
    -    Financial information systems design and implementation
    -    Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or
         contribution-in-kind reports
    -    Actuarial services
    -    Internal audit outsourcing services
    -    Management functions
    -    Human resources
    -    Broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services
    -    Legal services
    -    Expert services unrelated to the audit


7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these

<PAGE>


levels or amounts will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The
Audit Committee is mindful of the overall relationship of fees for audit and
non-audit services in determining whether to pre-approve any such services. For
each fiscal year, the Audit Committee may determine the appropriate ratio
between the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for
the Fund (including any Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
and management will immediately report to the chairman of the Audit Committee
any breach of this Policy that comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief
Financial Officer or any member of management.


9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.


10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:
    -    Van Kampen Investments, Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corporation
    -    Van Kampen Asset Management Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Trust Company

<PAGE>


    -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.
    -    Van Kampen Management Inc.
    -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.
    -    Morgan Stanley Investments LP
    -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company


(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services are determined to have a direct impact
on the operations or financial reporting of the Registrant. 100% of such
services were pre-approved by the audit committee pursuant to the Audit
Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures (attached hereto).

(f)     Not applicable.

(g)    See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

Not applicable.

Item 6.  [Reserved.]

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust invests in exclusively non-voting securities and therefore this item
is not applicable to the Trust.

Item 8.  Purchase of Equity Securities by Closed-End Management Investment
Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

Not Applicable.

Item 9.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not Applicable.

Item 10. Controls and Procedures

(a) The Trust's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in this Form N-CSR
was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, based
upon such officers' evaluation of these controls and procedures as of a date
within 90 days of the filing date of the report.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year
(the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003, AS AMENDED AUGUST 11, 2004



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         -        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         -        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         -        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         -        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         -        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in

<PAGE>


such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund and
the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered
Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In
addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees ("Boards")
that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         -        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment
                  of the Fund;

         -        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         -        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         -        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         -        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;

         -        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         -        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

<PAGE>

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         -        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;

         -        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         -        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         -        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         -        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         -        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         -        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         -        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         -        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         -        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         -        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

- ----------

(3)      Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the
registrant of a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."


<PAGE>


         -        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         -        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         -        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B
or C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.



<PAGE>

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

I, Ronald E. Robison, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Senior Income
     Trust;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   [Omitted]

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
