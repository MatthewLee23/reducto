LETTER FROM THE CEO

Dear Shareholders,

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders,
As a professional investor for more than 20 years, I've often been asked to
name the single most important factor in investment success. My answer is
always the same: diversification. At MFS we talk about applying a disciplined
diversification(SM) strategy to a portfolio as a three step process: allocate
among the major asset classes; diversify within each asset class; and
rebalance regularly to avoid unnecessary risk.

Individual investors sometimes assume that the amount they're putting away is
too small to allow for diversification. My response would be that a good
investment plan, developed with the help of an investment professional, should
provide a way to properly diversify your contributions.

Remember that the purpose of diversification is to own investments that
historically have not moved in sync with each other - in the hope that, in any
given period, underperforming holdings will be somewhat counteracted by other
outperforming holdings. If none of your asset classes did badly in the past
year or so, you're probably not properly diversified.

Americans today have more of their wealth tied up in the markets than in any
previous period of our history, but we are not yet making the most of our
opportunities. While neither asset allocation nor diversification can
guarantee a profit or protect against a loss, I would voice the opinion that,
to a large extent, a failure to have a plan, diversify contributions, and
rebalance a portfolio annually has been behind many U.S. investors' failure to
reach their long-term financial goals.

For more information on how to apply a disciplined diversification(SM)
strategy to your portfolio, I would urge you to contact your own investment
professional. You may also want to refer to information on the subject on our
Website, MFS.COM.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

MFS ORIGINAL RESEARCH(R)

A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT PROCESS

Since 1932 we have built our firm on the philosophy that fundamental, bottom-
up Original Research(SM) is the most effective process to take advantage of
investment opportunities in capital markets across all asset classes around
the world.

From start to finish, here is how the investment process at MFS(R) works:

o ANALYZE: Our analysts uncover investments one opportunity at a time by
  developing in-depth, firsthand knowledge of companies.

o COLLABORATE: Constant communication enables our analysts and portfolio
  managers to exchange opinions and challenge ideas in a spirit of
  collaboration.

o RECOMMEND: The analysts give "buy" ratings to the securities they believe
  offer the greatest long-term opportunities.

o INVEST: Our portfolio managers construct diversified portfolios by taking the
  analysts' recommendations, drawing on their own experience, and using that
  combined knowledge to select securities that they believe match their
  portfolios' investment discipline.

o ASSESS RISK: MFS' quantitative teams help the managers in their efforts to
  ensure that the risk levels they assume are appropriate for their portfolios'
  objectives.

o MONITOR: The analysts and portfolio managers continue to review the
  fundamentals of every security in a portfolio in their efforts to ensure it
  remains a right fit for that particular portfolio.

FOCUSED ON YOUR GOALS

We believe that bottom-up research is the best way to uncover the factors that
drive security prices over the long term and the best way to help investors
pursue their long-term financial goals.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the MFS Government Markets Income Trust
provided a total return of 2.96%, at net asset value. In comparison, the
trust's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Government/Mortgage Index, returned
2.89%. The trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current
income. The trust will attempt to achieve this objective by investing at least
80% of its net assets in U.S. and non-U.S. government securities.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The U.S. fixed-income market experienced a flattening of the yield curve
during the six-month period. (A yield curve for bonds shows the relationship
between yield and time to maturity.) The U.S. Federal Reserve Board raised its
target federal funds rate four times, continuing its steady drumbeat of
quarter-point rate hikes that began on June 30, 2004. But while the Fed seemed
committed to a course of gradually raising short-term rates, several factors
caused long-term rates to stagnate or retreat.

Job growth, which had shot up in the spring of 2004, ebbed and flowed during
the period; uncertainty about the employment situation helped to push down
yields on longer-dated bonds. Another factor that held long-term rates down
was overseas demand for U.S. Treasuries, especially from foreign central
banks. However, moderate GDP growth and inflation concerns kept shorter-term
interest rates moving up. For the period as a whole, the net effect was a
substantial flattening of the yield curve as short-term rates rose
significantly while long-term rates were generally flat to down.

TRUST POSITIONING

MFS Government Markets Income Trust, a closed-end trust, maintains a portfolio
primarily consisting of U.S. government and foreign government securities.

A significant portion of the portfolio was invested in U.S. government
securities while the remainder was invested in emerging market debt and
sovereign debt of foreign governments. The majority of our U.S. holdings were
split amongst agencies, mortgage-backed and government securities. Our foreign
holdings were allocated across Europe and Pacific Rim nations, excluding
Japan. We emphasized European government bonds while avoiding Japan, because
we felt that interest rates there were extremely low and the environment
provided little potential for growth. Alternatively, we invested in Australia,
New Zealand and the U.K.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

The trust's yield curve exposure aided results relative to the benchmark.
Over the period interest rates increased on the short-end of the yield curve
(3 months to 5 years) while decreasing on the longer end (10 years to 30
years). In comparison to the index, the trust had a smaller concentration of
bonds with maturities less than five years, while a greater portion of the
portfolio was invested in bonds with maturities greater than ten years. In
this environment, having greater exposure to long term bonds and less exposure
to short term bonds contributed to the trust's outperformance over the period.
Our positioning in agency related securities and mortgages issued by Fannie
Mae generated strong results. Our holdings in European sovereign debt and
emerging markets contributed over the period as well.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

The trust's Japanese and Swedish currency exposure acted as a drag on
performance. Over the period, the dollar appreciated against the euro, British
pound, and Pacific Rim currencies, which hurt returns of our unhedged foreign
denominated bond holdings. During the period, the benchmark benefited from a
yield advantage over the trust. The benchmark generated a higher level of
income over the period, which negatively impacted performance. Additionally,
the trust's positioning in TIPS (treasury inflation protection securities)
dampened results.

value. The trust's shares also may trade at a premium to their net asset
value.

When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset value of
the underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive
less than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As
a result, the total return that is calculated based on the net asset value and
New York Stock Exchange price can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as
a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her shares
and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be treated as
gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of shareholder capital
have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and increasing the trust's
expense ratio.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
and options. These types of instruments can increase share price fluctuation.

The portfolio invests in foreign and/or emerging markets securities, which are
more susceptible to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic, and
political risks.

The portfolio invests in government-guaranteed securities. These guarantees
apply to the underlying securities only and not to the prices and yields of
the portfolio.

The portfolio can invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in one or
more issuers, thereby making it more susceptible to any single economic,
political or regulatory occurence.

Because the portfolio invests in interest bearing securities, its value will
be affected by changes in interest rates.

These risks can increase share price volatility.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

(S) Effective June 7, 2004, the investment adviser has voluntarily agreed to reimburse the trust for its proportional share of
    substantially all of Independent Chief Compliance Officer services paid to Tarantino LLC. If this fee had been incurred by
    the trust, the net investment income per share and the ratios would have been:

       November 30, 2002 was to decrease net investment income per share by $0.02, increase net realized and unrealized gains

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the trust) is a non-diversified trust
that is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management
investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
trust can invest in foreign securities. Investments in foreign securities are
vulnerable to the effects of changes in the relative values of the local
currency and the U.S. dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's
legal, political, and economic environment.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) in the trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated
bid price as reported by an independent pricing service, or to the extent a
valuation is not reported by a pricing service, such securities are valued on
the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data
processing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-
counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more accurately
the fair value of such securities. Listed options are valued at the closing
price as reported by an independent pricing service on the principal exchange
on which they are traded. Unlisted options are valued by an independent
pricing service or on the basis of quotations obtained from brokers and
dealers. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price as reported by
an independent pricing service on the primary exchange on which they are
traded. Forward foreign currency contracts are valued using spot rates and
forward points as reported by an independent pricing source. Short-term
obligations with a remaining maturity in excess of 60 days will be valued upon
dealer-supplied valuations. All other short-term obligations in the trust's
portfolio are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value as
determined by the Board of Trustees. Investment valuations, other assets, and
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. When pricing
service information or market quotations are not readily available, securities
are priced at fair value as determined under the direction of the Board of
Trustees.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust
requires that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be
transferred to the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to
obtain those securities in the event of a default under the repurchase
agreement. The trust monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral
to ensure that its value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts
owed to the trust under each such repurchase agreement. The trust, along with
other affiliated entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS),
may utilize a joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or
more repurchase agreements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of
both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at
a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is
required to deposit with the broker, either in cash or securities, an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are
made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes
as unrealized gains or losses by the trust. The trust's investment in futures
contracts is designed to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest
or exchange rates or securities prices. Investments in interest rate futures
for purposes other than hedging may be made to modify the duration of the
portfolio without incurring the additional transaction costs involved in
buying and selling the underlying securities. Investments in currency futures
for purposes other than hedging may be made to change the trust's relative
position in one or more currencies without buying and selling portfolio
assets. Investments in equity index contracts or contracts on related options
for purposes other than hedging, may be made when the trust has cash on hand
and wishes to participate in anticipated market appreciation while the cash is
being invested. Should interest or exchange rates or securities prices move
unexpectedly, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
futures contracts and may realize a loss.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the
value of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The trust may enter
into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for hedging purposes as well
as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may enter into
contracts to deliver or receive foreign currency it will receive from or
require for its normal investment activities. The trust may also use contracts
in a manner intended to protect foreign currency-denominated securities from
declines in value due to unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging
purposes, the trust may enter into contracts with the intent of changing the
relative exposure of the trust's portfolio of securities to different
currencies to take advantage of anticipated changes. The forward foreign
currency exchange contracts are adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the
underlying currency and any gains or losses are recorded as unrealized until
the contract settlement date. On contract settlement date, the gains or losses
are recorded as realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions.

DOLLAR ROLL TRANSACTIONS - The trust enters into dollar roll transactions,
with respect to mortgage backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae,
and Freddie Mac, in which the trust sells mortgage backed securities to
financial institutions and simultaneously agrees to accept substantially
similar (same type, coupon, and maturity) securities at a later date at an
agreed-upon price. During the period between the sale and repurchase in a
dollar roll transaction the trust will not be entitled to receive interest and
principal payments on the securities sold but is compensated by interest
earned on the proceeds of the initial sale and by a lower purchase price on
the securities to be repurchased which enhances the trust's total return. The
trust accounts for dollar roll transactions as purchases and sales. If certain
criteria are met these dollar roll transactions may be considered a financing
transaction whereby the difference in the sales price and the future purchase
price is recorded as an adjustment to interest income.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Some securities may be purchased on a "when-issued" or
"forward delivery" basis, which means that the securities will be delivered to
the trust at a future date, usually beyond customary settlement time. Interest
income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium and discount is amortized
or accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. All discount is accreted for tax reporting
purposes as required by federal income tax regulations. Dividends received in
cash are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividend and interest payments
received in additional securities are recorded on the ex-dividend or ex-
interest date in an amount equal to the value of the security on such date.

The trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements involving its
portfolio holdings. Any proceeds received are reflected in realized gain/loss
in the statement of operations, or in unrealized gain/loss if the security is
still held by the trust.

The trust may enter into "TBA" (to be announced) purchase commitments to
purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a future date. Although the unit
price has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the principal amount of the commitments will not fluctuate more than
0.01%. The trust holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or high-
grade debt obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price, or
the trust may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other
securities it owns. Income on the securities will not be earned until
settlement date. TBA purchase commitments may be considered securities in
themselves, and involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be
purchased declines prior to settlement date, which is in addition to the risk
of decline in the value of the trust's other assets. Unsettled TBA purchase
commitments are valued at the current market value of the underlying
securities.

The trust may enter into "TBA" (to be announced) sale commitments to hedge its
portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it owns under
delayed delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale commitments are not
received until the contractual settlement date. During the time a TBA sale
commitment is outstanding, equivalent deliverable securities, or an offsetting
TBA purchase commitment deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are
held as "cover" for the transaction.

Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the
value of a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal
fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer,
which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of
high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the
security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of
capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization
are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance
an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by
the trust. This amount, for the six months ended May 31, 2005, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for foreign currency transactions, amortization and accretion on
debt securities, straddle loss deferrals and wash sales.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended
November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003 was as follows:

                                           11/30/04           11/30/03
        Distributions declared from:
          Ordinary income               $17,946,379        $20,675,908

As of November 30, 2004, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

          Undistributed ordinary income                     $1,417,714
          Capital loss carryforward                        (28,360,010)
          Unrealized appreciation (depreciation)             5,922,320
          Other temporary differences                       (3,680,424)

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration as follows:

          EXPIRATION DATE

          November 30, 2005                                $(7,140,598)

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.32%
of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of gross investment income.
Management fees, from net assets and gross investment income, incurred for the
six months ended May 31, 2005 were at an effective rate of 0.60% of average
daily net assets on an annualized basis.

The trust pays compensation to its Independent Trustees in the form of a
retainer, attendance fees, and additional compensation to Board and Committee
chairpersons, and pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are
officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of the trust, all of whom
receive remuneration for their services to the trust from MFS. Certain
officers and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors of MFS and MFS
Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded, defined benefit plan
for retired Independent Trustees and an unfunded retirement benefit deferral
plan for current Independent Trustees. Included in Trustees' compensation is
$967 as a result of the change in the trust's unfunded retirement benefit
deferral plan for certain current Independent Trustees and a pension expense
of $33,776 for retired Independent Trustees for the six months ended
May 31, 2005.

This trust and certain other MFS funds (the "funds") have entered into a
services agreement (the "Agreement") which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. MFS has agreed to
reimburse each of the funds for a proportional share of substantially all of
the payments made by the funds to Tarantino LLC and also to provide office
space and other administrative support and supplies to the ICCO. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement between the funds and MFS, MFS is entitled to partial reimbursement
of the costs MFS incurs to provide these services, subject to review and
approval by the Board of Trustees. Each fund is allocated a portion of these
administrative costs based on its size and relative average net assets. The
trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the following annual percentage
rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

                                      BEGINNING OF PERIOD
          EFFECTIVE DATE                THROUGH 2/28/05      3/01/05

          First $2 billion                  0.01120%         0.01626%
          Next $2.5 billion                 0.00832%         0.01206%
          Next $2.5 billion                 0.00032%         0.00056%
          In excess of $7 billion           0.00000%         0.00000%

For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the trust paid MFS $23,272, equivalent
to 0.0119% of average daily net assets, to partially reimburse MFS for the
costs of providing administrative services.

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$55,536 for the six months ended May 31, 2005. Also included in transfer agent
and dividend disbursing costs are out-of-pocket expenses, paid to MFSC, which
amounted to $50,302 for the six months ended May 31, 2005, as well as other
expenses paid to unaffiliated vendors.

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The trust's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest. The trust repurchased and retired 1,089,600 shares of
beneficial interest during the six months ended May 31, 2005 at an average
price per share of $6.60 and a weighted average discount of 11.09% per share.

The trust repurchased and retired 1,993,000 shares of beneficial interest
during the year ended November 30, 2004 at an average price per share of $6.66
and a weighted average discount of 10.38% per share. Transactions in trust

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in a $1 billion unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a credit agreement.
Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to
each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve
funds rate plus 0.35%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average
daily, unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee
allocated to the trust for the six months ended May 31, 2005 was $1,515, and
is included in miscellaneous expense. The trust had no significant borrowings
during the six months ended May 31, 2005.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to
market risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These
financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
futures contracts. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments
represent the investment the trust has in particular classes of financial
instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject
to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is
meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

(8) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 31, 2004, MFS settled an administrative proceeding with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding disclosure of brokerage
allocation practices in connection with MFS fund sales (the term "MFS funds"
means the open-end registered management investment companies sponsored by
MFS). Under the terms of the settlement, in which MFS neither admitted nor
denied any wrongdoing, MFS agreed to pay (one dollar) $1.00 in disgorgement
and $50 million in penalty to certain MFS funds, pursuant to a plan developed
by an independent distribution consultant. The brokerage allocation practices
which were the subject of this proceeding were discontinued by MFS in November
2003. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an order of the SEC. The SEC
settlement order states that MFS failed to adequately disclose to the Boards
of Trustees and to shareholders of the MFS funds the specifics of its
preferred arrangements with certain brokerage firms selling MFS fund shares.
The SEC settlement order states that MFS had in place policies designed to
obtain best execution of all MFS fund trades. As part of the settlement, MFS
retained an independent compliance consultant to review the completeness of
its current policies and practices regarding disclosure to MFS fund trustees
and to MFS fund shareholders of strategic alliances between MFS or its
affiliates and broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries who support
the sale of MFS fund shares. Pursuant to the SEC order, on July 28, 2004, MFS
transferred these settlement amounts to the SEC, and those MFS funds entitled
to these settlement amounts accrued an estimate of their pro rata portion of
these amounts. The final distribution plan was approved by the SEC on January
21, 2005, and the affected MFS funds received the payment on February 16,
2005.

In addition, in February 2004, MFS reached agreement with the SEC, the New
York Attorney General ("NYAG") and the Bureau of Securities Regulation of the
State of New Hampshire ("NH") to settle administrative proceedings alleging
false and misleading information in certain MFS open-end retail fund ("MFS
retail funds") prospectuses regarding market timing and related matters (the
"February Settlements"). These regulators alleged that prospectus language for
certain MFS retail funds was false and misleading because, although the
prospectuses for those funds in the regulators' view indicated that they
prohibited market timing, MFS did not limit trading activity in 11 domestic
large cap stock, high grade bond and money market retail funds. MFS' former
Chief Executive Officer and former President also reached agreement with the
SEC in which they agreed to, among other terms, monetary fines and temporary
suspensions from association with any investment adviser or registered
investment company. These individuals have resigned their positions with, and
will not be returning to, MFS and the MFS funds. Under the terms of the
February Settlements, MFS and the executives neither admit nor deny
wrongdoing.

Under the terms of the February Settlements, a $225 million pool has been
established for distribution to shareholders in certain MFS retail funds,
which has been funded by MFS and of which $50 million is characterized as a
penalty. This pool will be distributed in accordance with a methodology
developed by an independent distribution consultant in consultation with MFS
and the Board of Trustees of the MFS retail funds, and acceptable to the SEC.
MFS has further agreed with NYAG to reduce its management fees in the
aggregate amount of approximately $25 million annually over the next five
years, and not to increase certain management fees during this period. MFS has
also paid an administrative fine to NH in the amount of $1 million, which will
be used for investor education purposes (NH retained $250,000 and $750,000 was
contributed to the North American Securities Administrators Association's
Investor Protection Trust). In addition, under the terms of the February
Settlements, MFS is in the process of adopting certain governance changes and
reviewing its policies and procedures.

Since December 2003, MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc., MFS Service Center,
Inc., MFS Corporation Retirement Committee, Sun Life Financial Inc., various
MFS funds, certain current and/or former Trustees of these MFS funds, and
certain officers of MFS have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits
filed in federal and state courts. The lawsuits variously have been commenced
as class actions or individual actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed shares of the MFS funds during specified periods, as ERISA
actions by participants in certain retirement plan accounts on behalf of those
accounts, or as derivative actions on behalf of the MFS funds. The lawsuits
relating to market timing and related matters have been transferred to, and
consolidated before, the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, as part of a multi-district litigation of market timing and related
claims involving several other fund complexes (In re Mutual Funds Investment
Litigation (Alger, Columbia, Janus, MFS, One Group, Putnam, Allianz Dresdner),
No. 1:04-md-15863 (transfer began March 19, 2004)). The market timing cases
related to the MFS complex are Riggs v. MFS et al., Case No. 04-cv-01162-JFM
(direct), Hammerslough v. MFS et al., Case No. 04-md-01620 (derivative) and
Anita Walker v. MFS et al., Case No. 1:04-CV-01758 (ERISA). The plaintiffs in
these consolidated lawsuits generally seek injunctive relief including removal
of the named Trustees, adviser and distributor, rescission of contracts and
12b-1 Plans, disgorgement of fees and profits, monetary damages, punitive
damages, attorney's fees and costs and other equitable and declaratory relief.
Two lawsuits alleging improper brokerage allocation practices and excessive
compensation are pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Massachusetts (Forsythe v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al., No. 04cv10584
(GAO) (a consolidated action) and Marcus Dumond, et al. v. Massachusetts
Financial Servs. Co., et al., No. 04cv11458 (GAO)). The plaintiffs in these
lawsuits generally seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, recovery of
fees, rescission of contracts, an accounting, restitution, declaratory relief,
equitable and/or injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs. The various
lawsuits generally allege that some or all of the defendants (i) permitted or
acquiesced in market timing and/or late trading in some of the MFS funds,
inadequately disclosed MFS' internal policies concerning market timing and
such matters (ii) received excessive compensation as fiduciaries to the MFS
funds, or (iii) permitted or acquiesced in the improper use of fund assets by
MFS to support the distribution of MFS fund shares and inadequately disclosed
MFS' use of fund assets in this manner. The actions assert that some or all of
the defendants violated the federal securities laws, including the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as well as fiduciary duties and other violations
of common law. Insofar as any of the actions is appropriately brought
derivatively on behalf of any of the MFS funds, any recovery will inure to the
benefit of the MFS funds. In February, March, and April 2005, the defendants
filed separate motions to dismiss all claims of the various lawsuits. The
parties continue to brief the issues for the courts and various hearing dates
have been scheduled. Additional lawsuits based on similar allegations may be
filed in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
judgments or settlements for damages against MFS, the MFS funds, or any other
named defendant. As noted above, as part of the regulatory settlements, MFS
has established a restitution pool in the amount of $225 million to compensate
certain shareholders of certain MFS retail funds for damages that they
allegedly sustained as a result of market timing or late trading in certain of
the MFS retail funds, and distributed $50 million to affected MFS funds to
compensate those funds based upon the amount of brokerage commissions
allocated in recognition of MFS fund sales. It is not clear whether these
amounts will be sufficient to compensate shareholders for all of the damage
they allegedly sustained, whether certain shareholders or putative class
members may have additional claims to compensation, or whether the damages
that may be awarded in any of the actions will exceed these amounts. In the
event the MFS funds incur any losses, costs or expenses in connection with
such lawsuits, the Boards of Trustees of the affected MFS funds may pursue
claims on behalf of such funds against any party that may have liability to
the funds in respect thereof.

Review of these matters by the independent Trustees of the MFS funds and their
counsel is continuing. There can be no assurance that these regulatory actions
and lawsuits, or the adverse publicity associated with these developments,
will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced sales of fund shares,
or other adverse consequences to the MFS funds.

While these developments relate to MFS and the MFS' open-end funds, there can
be no assurance that these developments, or the adverse publicity associated
with these developments, will not result in an increase to the market discount
of the MFS closed-end fund shares or other adverse consequences.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Government Markets Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of May 31, 2005, and the related statement of operations,
changes in net assets, and financial highlights for the six-month period ended
May 31, 2005. These interim financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements and financial
highlights referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of changes
in net assets for the year ended November 30, 2004, and financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period ended November 30, 2004, and in our
report dated January 21, 2005, we expressed an unqualified opinion on such
statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights.

                                      (AS REVISED FEBRUARY, 2004 AND MAY, 2005)

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

         o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
           or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
           relationships;

         o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
           reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
           Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
           communications made by the Funds;

         o compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
           and regulations;

         o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
           appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o accountability for adherence to the Code.

II. CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer
should not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests
and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Covered Officer must:

         o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
           improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
           for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
           the detriment of the Fund; and

         o not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
           individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
           benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o running for political office;

         o the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
           has current or prospective business dealings unless such
           entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
           as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
           of impropriety;

         o any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
           relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
           banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
           principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
           thereof;

         o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
           charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
           transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
           interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
           ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
           disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
           others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
           or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
           and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
           her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
           employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
           full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
           reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
           in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
           compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
           standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
           regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
           becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
           or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
           with the requirements of the Code;

         o annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
           or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
           Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
           Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
           employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
           potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
           Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or
other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this
Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to

     b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting.
