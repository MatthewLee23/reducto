               FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular monthly, fixed cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.

   The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid
back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or
"income".

   The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) notices
of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting
purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting
purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder
of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The
Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will
tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.

   The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan at
any time, without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

DEAR FELLOW ZTR SHAREHOLDER:

   I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for the
Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value increased 5.06% for the
quarter ended December 31, 2010, including $0.099 in re-invested distributions.
During the same period, the Fund's Composite Index increased 4.11% including
re-invested dividends. The Fund's average exposure for the quarter was
approximately 40% in bonds and 29% in equities.

   For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Fund's net asset value rose
7.21%, including $0.396 in re-invested distributions. During the same period,
the Fund's Composite Index increased 10.82% including re-invested dividends.
The Fund's average exposure for the year was approximately 36% in bonds and 40%
in equities.

          Sincerely,

          /s/ George R. Aylward
          George R. Aylward
          President, Chairman and
          Chief Executive Officer
          The Zweig Total Return
          Fund, Inc.
                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

                                 EQUITY MARKET


   Marking the second year of recovery from the financial crisis, the stock
market climbed higher in 2010. Gaining 7.3%/(1)/ in the fourth quarter and
18.5%/(1)/ for the second half, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11%/(1)/
for the year and closed at 11,577.51. The Dow ended 76.8%/(1)/ above its low of
6,547.05 on March 9, 2009 but still lags 18%/(1)/ below its all-time high of
14,164.53 on October 9, 2007. Increasing 6.5%/(1)/ in December alone, the S&P
500 Index moved up 12.8%/(1)/ for the year to finish at 1,257.64. This followed
a gain of 23%/(1)/ in 2009. Paced by its strong technology positions, the
Nasdaq Composite finished at 2,652.87, a rise of 16.9%/(1)/ for 2010.

   Despite losses in the debt-challenged countries of Portugal, Italy, Ireland,
Greece and Spain, the broad STOXX Europe 600 advanced 9%/(1)/ to end 2010 at a
two-year high. The biggest gainer was Germany's DAX Index, which increased
16%/(1)/. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 9%/(1)/. In Asia, most markets soared but
China and Japan, the two biggest economies, lost ground. The Shanghai Composite
slipped 14%/(1)/ and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average dipped 3%/(1)/.

   Stating that he expected economic growth to be "moderately stronger this
year," Federal Reserve (the "Fed") Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress that
"we have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer
and business spending may be taking hold." However, he cautioned that
employment "improved only moderately" and that "it could take four or five more
years for the job market to normalize fully."

   The continued weakness in hiring was evident in the Labor Department's
report for December. While the jobless rate dropped to 9.4% from November's
9.8%, employers added only 103,000 jobs in December, far below the pace needed
to establish a stabilized labor market. Much of the decline in the unemployment
rate was attributed to the large number of discouraged people no longer seeking
work.

   Signs of economic strength came from the Institute of Supply Management. Its
index of manufacturing activity expanded in December to 57. Figures above 50
signal expansion. The agency's barometer of service sector activities climbed
to 57.1 in December, the twelfth straight month of expansion and the highest
figure since May 2006.

   Also encouraging was the report by the Commerce Department that new orders
received by American factories, excluding transportation, rose 2.4% in
November, the largest gain in eight months. October showed a 0.1% rise.
Unfilled orders increased 0.6% in November after rising 0.7% in October.

   Reflecting an improved economy, the nation's gross domestic product
increased 2.6% in the third quarter, an upward revision of the earlier 2.5%
growth estimate and significantly above the 1.7% gain in the second quarter,
according to the Commerce Department. Further economic growth was indicated by
the surge in U.S. exports in October, the last month for which figures are
available. A 3.2% gain in exports and a 0.5% drop in imports brought the
domestic trade deficit to a nine-month low of $38.7 billion, according to the
Commerce Department. October exports were the largest since August 2008, the
month before the economic crisis hit.

   The value of the dollar, a key factor in international trade, gained
strength in 2010, with the US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a
basket of world currencies, gaining 1.5%. The dollar ended the year up 6.6%
against the euro and 3.6% against the British pound. However the dollar dropped
12.8% against the Japanese yen.

   Housing activity, a major component of the economy, presented a mixed
picture. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 3.9% in
November to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 555,000 units. However new
building permits declined 4% in November to the lowest level since April 2009,
following a 0.9% gain in October. Sales of new homes reached a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 290,000 against 275,000 in October but was
still only at 20% of the peak level of 2005. Overall construction spending
increased 0.4% in November to an annual pace of $810.2 billion, a five-month
high.

   Rather than investing in expansion and hiring workers, non-financial
companies in the U.S. were holding $1.93 trillion in cash and other liquid
assets at the end of September, up from $1.8 trillion at the end of June,
according to the Federal Reserve. Cash represented 7.4% of the total assets,
the largest proportion since 1959.

   Marking the first world-wide increase in mergers and acquisitions since the
financial crisis, global volume reached $2.74 trillion last year against $2.2
trillion in 2009, according to Dealogic. The U.S. share was $874.7 billion with
9,627 deals. Europe accounted for $786.3 billion in deals and emerging markets,
with 32% of the total, saw $889.3 billion in deals. While down 4% from the
third quarter of 2010, global volume in the fourth quarter grew 17% to $738
billion from $630.3 billion in the final quarter a year ago.

   Initial public offerings also came back to life in 2010. World-wide
registrations totaled 1,376 and raised $269.4 billion, more than double the
amounts in 2009 and 2008, according to Dealogic.

                                      3

The U.S. saw 110 new stocks, valued at $35.5 billion, enter the market, more
than double the 2009 total of $13.9 billion. China, with 471 offerings, raised
$104.4 billion, dominating the market. China alone raised more money than the
U.S. and Europe combined.

   While U.S. consumer spending increased 0.4% in November from October, the
pace of inflation remained subdued. The consumer price index rose only 0.1% in
November and was up 1.1% for the year, according to the Labor Department. The
core measurement, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also gained
0.1% for the month and was only 0.8% higher than a year ago. The Producer Price
Index rose 0.8% in November and was 3.5% above a year earlier. However the
producer price core gauge was only 1.2% above the 2009 level.

   Consumer confidence slipped in November but stock market analysts and
investors remained very bullish. The Conference Board reported that its index
of consumer attitudes fell to 52.5 in December from an upward revised 54.3 in
November. Expressing more positive views, advisors surveyed by Investors
Intelligence showed 56% bulls at the year-end and only 20% bears. Similar views
were reported by members of the American Institute of Investors, which had 62%
bulls and 20% bears. These figures show a stronger bullish sentiment than at
the end of the third quarter when analysts stood at 43% bulls and 28% bears and
investors at 42% bulls and 32% bears. We believe that these readings indicate
an excess of optimism which is not good for the market.

   A less optimistic outlook prevailed for company earnings. Analysts expect
profits to rise by 13.4% this year, far below the projected increase of 37.8%
for 2010, according to Thomson Reuters. The higher profits last year were
largely driven by cost savings by companies. During the recession they became
lean and mean, laying off workers and concentrating on reducing expenditures.
Consequently, earnings climbed substantially. However, as the latest forecast
from analysts shows, they will not rise forever.

   Based on estimated earnings, Bloomberg News reported that stocks in the S&P
500 were trading at a price/earnings ratio of 15.03 on December 31, 2010
against 15.92 on September 30 and 19.61 at the end of 2009. The P/Es for
trailing twelve-month earnings were 21.25, 21.35 and 16.99 respectively. The
declines in P/E's during the year reflect the higher earnings even though the
market went up. On the surface, the valuations appear reasonable but they are
not cheap.

   Looking forward, the major problem, as we mentioned earlier, is too much
optimism. As a result, our sentiment indicator is negative. With the market
continuing to rise slowly, our tape indicator is fine. Our monetary indicator,
which depends largely on Fed actions, is okay. At the moment the Fed is buying
bonds and definitely not tightening, holding short-term interest rates near
zero. Given our policy not to fight the tape or the Fed, we have these two
factors going for us. However, there still is excessive optimism to worry about.

   Because of our nervousness about the sentiment data, our market posture is
somewhat better than neutral but less than moderately bullish. After cutting
back recently from 80%, we are currently at about 75% invested.

                                  BOND MARKET

   Last year turned out to be much better for bonds than most economists and
strategists expected. The benchmark 10-year Treasury began 2010 at a yield of
3.84% and traded upward briefly to nearly 4% in early April when the economy
seemed to be gaining momentum. (Yields move in the opposite direction from
price - when bond yields rise, bond prices fall.) It then began a huge rally as
data showed the broad economy struggling. Ultimately the yield on the 10-year
Treasury hit a low of 2.38% in early October as discussion of a possible
"double dip" mounted and anemic job growth created further worries about the
recovery.

   However, as corporate earnings and retail sales came in stronger than
expected, the bond market sold off, with yields rising to 3.30% on the 10-year
Treasury by the end of 2010. Overall, the actual return on the 10-year Treasury
was 7.9%, including both coupon yield and price appreciation. The broad index
of the Barclay's Government had a total return of 5.53%.

   Given that stocks also had a good year, with an especially upbeat second
half, it is not surprising that corporate bonds out-performed Treasury bonds in
2010. Generally, the lowest credit ratings (junk bonds) did best, with higher
credit bonds not faring quite as well. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
(TIPS) slightly underperformed their plain vanilla counterparts. However, the
difference was very small by the end of the year as deflation fears abated and
commodity prices rose, invoking the spectre of inflation.

   Overall, the year could be viewed as an economic disappointment, which
generally leads to better bond prices. In addition, the Fed's policy of
"quantitative easing" also supported bonds across the risk spectrum. While this
program will not last indefinitely, the Fed appears to have an easy money
policy, under which asset prices should remain firm.

   The Fund's bond portfolio did not change much during the fourth quarter. Our
bonds have a relatively low duration, (a measure of sensitivity to interest
rates) and we hold a diversified mix of corporate bonds, Treasury bonds of
various maturities and TIPS. While the low duration curtailed performance
somewhat, the corporate exposure helped as did sales of bonds at lower yield
levels (higher prices) during the year. The bond model remained cautious and,
given the recent sharp end-of-year selloff in bonds, we remain marginally more
on the sidelines. If the Fed is willing to err on the side of inflation (rather
than risk deflation), bonds will likely struggle in the future. As a result, we
are taking a cautious stand on the bond portfolio in the new year.

              Sincerely,

              /s/Martin E. Zweig, Ph.D.

performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee that
market forecasts will be realized.

As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. As such, this Fund's share value may
decline substantially and it is possible to lose a significant portion of your
principal when interest rates rise.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               DECEMBER 31, 2010

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's investment objective is to seek the
highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and those differences could be significant.

  A. SECURITY VALUATION:

   Security Valuation procedures for the funds have been approved by the Board
of Trustees. All internally fair valued securities referred to below are
approved by a valuation committee appointed under the direction of the Board of
Trustees.

   The Fund utilizes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.

   .   Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

   .   Level 2 -- prices determined using other significant observable inputs
       (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
       prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

   .   Level 3 -- prices determined using significant unobservable inputs
       (including the valuation committee's own assumptions in determining the
       fair value of investments)

   A description of the valuation techniques applied to the Fund's major
categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis is as follows:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price and are categorized as Level
1 in the hierarchy. Restricted equity securities and private placements that
are not widely traded, are illiquid or are internally fair valued by the
valuation committee, are generally categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.

   Certain foreign securities may be fair valued in cases where closing prices
are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily available
market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in the U.S.
securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur between
the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally traded)
and the time that the Fund

                                      18

<PAGE>


calculates its net asset value (generally, the close of the NYSE) that may
impact the value of securities traded in these foreign markets. In such cases
the Fund fair values foreign securities using an external pricing service which
considers the correlation of the trading patterns of the foreign security to
the intraday trading in the U.S. markets for investments such as American
Depositary Receipts, financial futures, exchange-traded funds, and certain
indexes as well as prices for similar securities. Such fair valuations are
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Because the frequency of significant
events is not predictable, fair valuation of certain Foreign Common stocks may
occur on a frequent basis.

   Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on
evaluated quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For most bond types, the pricing service
utilizes matrix pricing which considers yield or price of bonds of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, current cash flows, type, and current day trade
information, as well as dealer supplied prices. These valuations are generally
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Structured debt instruments such as
Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed securities may also incorporate collateral
analysis and utilize cash flow models for valuation and are generally
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Pricing services do not provide
pricing for all securities and therefore dealer supplied prices are utilized
representing indicative bids based on pricing models used by market makers in
the security and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Debt
securities that are not widely traded, are illiquid, or are internally fair
valued by the valuation committee are generally categorized as Level 3 in the
hierarchy.

   Listed derivatives that are actively traded are valued based on quoted
prices from the exchange and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Over
the counter (OTC) derivative contracts, which include forward currency
contracts and equity linked instruments are valued based on inputs observed
from actively quoted markets and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy.

   Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at their closing net asset
value determined as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) each business day and are categorized as
Level 1 in the hierarchy.

   Short-term Notes having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market and are generally categorized as
Level 2 in the hierarchy.

   A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's major categories of assets
and liabilities, which primarily include investments of the Fund, by each major
security type is disclosed at the end of the Schedule of Investments for the
Fund. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

  B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INCOME:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.

  C. SECURITY LENDING ($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS):

   The Fund may loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement with
The Bank of New York Mellon ("BNY Mellon"). Under the terms of the agreement,
the Fund is required to maintain collateral with a market value not less than
100% of the market value of loaned securities. Collateral is adjusted daily in
connection with changes in the market value of securities on loan. Collateral
may consist

                                      19

<PAGE>


of cash and U.S. Government Securities. Cash collateral is invested in a
short-term money market fund. Dividends earned on the collateral and premiums
paid by the broker are recorded as income by the Fund net of fees and rebates
charged by BNY Mellon for its services in connection with this securities
lending program. Lending portfolio securities involves a risk of delay in the
recovery of the loaned securities or in the foreclosure on collateral.

   At December 31, 2010, the Fund had securities on loan with a market value of
$15,076 for which the Fund received cash collateral of $13,907 and U.S.
Government Securities Collateral of $1,527.

  D. INCOME TAXES:

   The Fund is treated as a separate taxable entity. It is the policy of the
Fund to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes
has been made.

   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

   The Fund follows the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure
of uncertainty in tax positions, which requires the Fund to determine whether a
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on
the technical merits of the position. The Fund has determined that there was no
effect on the financial statements from the following of this authoritative
guidance. The Fund does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. The Fund files tax
returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they
operate. In the normal course of business, the Fund is subject to examination
by federal, state and local jurisdictions, where applicable. As of December 31,
2010, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax
jurisdictions under the statute of limitations is from the year 2007 forward
(with limited exceptions).

  E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest.

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10 percent of the Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent
earnings from net investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary,
return of capital. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the
Fund's investment performance from the terms of the Fund's Managed Distribution
Plan.

                                      20

<PAGE>



  F. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

NOTE 3 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED)

NOTE 5 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS

   Under the Fund's organizational documents and related agreements, its
directors and officers are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters
into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these arrangements.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At December 31, 2010, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 114,594,744
shares are outstanding.

   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the periods ended December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, there were no shares issued pursuant to the Plan.

   On December 20, 2010, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.033 per share
to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010. This distribution has an
ex-dividend date of January 4, 2011, and is payable on January 10, 2011. Please
see inside front cover for more information on the Fund's distributions.

NOTE 7 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.

                                      22

<PAGE>



   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

NOTE 8 -- REGULATORY EXAMS

   Federal and state regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries
and conduct examinations regarding compliance by Virtus and its subsidiaries
(collectively "the Company") with securities and other laws and regulations
affecting their registered products.

   There are currently no such matters which the Company believes will be
material to these financial statements.

NOTE 9 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION

($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS)

   At December 31, 2010, federal tax cost and aggregate gross unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) of securities held by the Fund were as follows:

                                                          NET UNREALIZED
      FEDERAL       UNREALIZED          UNREALIZED         APPRECIATION
     TAX COST      APPRECIATION        DEPRECIATION       (DEPRECIATION)
     ---------  ------------------  ------------------  ------------------
     $432,072        $45,811             $(8,048)            $37,763

   For the period ended December 31, 2010, the Fund utilized losses of $9,438
deferred in prior years against current year capital gains.

   Under current tax law, foreign currency and capital losses realized after
October 31 may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Fund
deferred $218 and recognized $1,398 of post-October losses.

   The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the table above)
consist of undistributed ordinary income of $0 and undistributed long-term
capital gains of $0.

   The differences between the book and tax basis components of distributable
earnings relate principally to the timing of recognition of income and gains
for federal income tax purposes. Short-term gain distributions reported in the
Statement of Changes in Net Assets, if any, are reported as ordinary income for
federal tax purposes. Distributions are determined on a tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial
reporting purpose.

NOTE 10 -- RECLASSIFICATION OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

   As of December 31, 2010, the Fund increased undistributed net investment
income by $30,599, decreased the accumulated net realized loss by $6,582, and
decreased capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest by $37,181.

NOTE 11 -- RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

   In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting
Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-06 "Improving Disclosures about Fair Value
Measurements." ASU 2010-06 will require reporting entities to make new
disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll
forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The new and revised

NOTE 12 --  SUBSEQUENT EVENT EVALUATIONS

   Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund
through the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that
the following subsequent event requires recognition or disclosure in these
financial statements.

   On January 18, 2011, the Fund announced that it had issued 29.5 million
Common Shares pursuant to its recently completed non-transferable rights
offering.

   Total net proceeds of the rights offering are estimated at approximately $98
million, after deduction for estimated offering expenses. Net proceeds were
calculated based on a share subscription price of $3.34, which equals 95% of
$3.52, the average of the last reported sales prices of the Fund's Common
Shares on January 7, 2011 (the Pricing Date) and the four preceding business
days.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.:

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Zweig Total Return Fund,
Inc. (the "Fund") at December 31, 2010, the results of its operations for the
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2010 by correspondence with the
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                 AUTOMATIC REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") allows you to conveniently
reinvest distributions monthly in additional Fund shares thereby enabling you
to compound your returns from the Fund. By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able
to invest money regularly and automatically, and watch your investment grow.

   It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure
a profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

ENROLLMENT IN THE REINVESTMENT PLAN

   It is the policy of the Fund to automatically reinvest distributions payable
to shareholders. A "registered" shareholder automatically becomes a participant
in the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). The
Plan authorizes the Fund to credit all shares of common stock to participants
upon a distribution regardless of whether the shares are trading at a discount
or premium to the net asset value. Registered shareholders may terminate their
participation and receive distributions in cash by contacting Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"). The termination will become
effective with the next distribution if the Plan Administrator is notified at
least 7 business days prior to the distribution payment date. Registered
shareholders that wish to change their distribution option from cash payment to
reinvest may do so by contacting the Plan Administrator at 1-800-272-2700.

   In the case of banks, brokers, or other nominees which hold your shares for
you as the beneficial owner, the Plan Administrator will administer the Plan
based on the information provided by the bank, broker or nominee. To the extent
that you wish to participate in the Plan, you should contact the broker, bank
or nominee holding your shares to ensure that your account is properly
represented. If necessary, you may have your shares taken out of the name of
the broker, bank or nominee and register them in your own name.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED THROUGH THE REINVESTMENT PLAN

   When a distribution is declared, nonparticipants in the plan will receive
cash. Participants in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund valued as
described below:

   If on the payable date of the distribution, the market price of the Fund's
common stock is less than the net asset value, the Plan Administrator will buy
Fund shares on behalf of the Participant in the open market, on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) or elsewhere. The price per share will be equal to the
weighted average price of all shares purchased, including commissions.
Commission rates are currently $0.02 per share, although the rate is subject to
change and may vary. If, following the commencement of purchases and before the
Plan Administrator has completed its purchases, the trading price equals or
exceeds the most recent net asset value of the common shares, the Plan
Administrator may cease purchasing shares on the open market and the Fund may
issue the remaining shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) the net asset
value on the last day the Plan Administrator purchased shares or (b) 95% of the
market price on such day. In the case where the Plan Administrator has
terminated open market purchase and the Fund has issued the remaining shares,
the number of shares received by the Participant in respect of the cash
distribution will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares

                                      31

<PAGE>


purchased in the open market and the price at which the Fund issued the
remaining shares. Under certain circumstances, the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission may require limitation or temporary
suspension of market purchases of shares under the Plan. The Plan Administrator
will not be accountable for its inability to make a purchase during such a
period.

   If on the payable date of the distribution, the market price is equal to or
exceeds the net asset value, Participants will be issued new shares by the Fund
at the greater of the (a) the net asset value on the payable date or (b) 95% of
the market price on such date.

   The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve Participants of
any income tax which may be payable on such distributions. A Participant in the
Plan will be treated for federal income tax purposes, as having received on a
payment date, a distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant
could have received instead of shares. If you participate in the Plan, you will
receive a Form 1099-DIV concerning the Federal tax status of distributions paid
during the year.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments
for investment in shares of the Fund. Such payments can be made in any amount
from $100 per payment to $3,000 per month. The Plan Administrator will use the
funds received to purchase Fund shares in the open market on the 15/th/ of each
month or the next business day if the 15/th/ falls on a weekend or holiday (the
"Investment Date"). The purchase price per share will be equal to the weighted
average price of all shares purchased on the Investment Date, including
commissions. There is no charge to shareholders for Cash Purchases. The plan
administrator's fee will be paid by the Fund. However, each participating
shareholder will pay pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred
(currently $0.02 per share, but may vary and is subject to change) with respect
to the Plan Administrator's open market purchases in connection with all cash
investments. Voluntary cash payments should be sent to Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., PO Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078.

   Participants have an unconditional right to obtain the return of any cash
payment if the Plan Administrator receives written notice at least 5 business
days before such payment is to be invested.

AUTOMATIC MONTHLY INVESTMENT

   Participants in the Plan may purchase additional shares by means of an
Automatic Monthly Investment of not less than $100 nor more than $3,000 per
month by electronic funds transfer from a predesignated U.S bank account. If a
Participant has already established a Plan account and wishes to initiate
Automatic Monthly Investments, the Participant must complete and sign an
automatic monthly investment form and return it to the Plan Administrator
together with a voided check or deposit slip for the account from which funds
are to be withdrawn. Automatic monthly investment forms may be obtained from
the Plan Administrator by calling 1-800-272-2700.

TERMINATION OF SHARES

   Shareholders wishing to liquidate shares held with the Plan Administrator
must do so in writing or by calling 1-800-272-2700. The Plan Administrator does
not charge a fee for liquidating your shares; however, currently a brokerage
commission of $0.02 will be charged. This charge may vary and is subject to
change.

                                      32

<PAGE>



   Once terminated, you may re-enroll in the Plan (provided you still have
shares registered in your name) by contacting the Plan Administrator at
1-800-272-2700.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   For more information regarding the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase
Plan, please contact the Plan Administrator at 1-800-272-2700 or visit our
website at Virtus.com.

   The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent
to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan at least 90
days before the record date for such distribution. The Plan also may be amended
or terminated by the Plan Administrator with at least 90 days written notice to
participants in the Plan.

       less than fifty percent.

    (g)The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for

       investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
       primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
       another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
       or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
       to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of the

   where appropriate, to participate in corporate governance, shareholder
   proposals, management communications and legal proceedings. The Fund and its
   Delegate(s) must also identify potential or actual conflicts of interests in
   voting proxies and address any such conflict of interest in accordance with
   this Statement of Policy.

<PAGE>

III Factors to consider when voting.

    A. A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect on
       shareholders' economic interests or the value of the Portfolio Holding
       is indeterminable or insignificant.

    B  In analyzing ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES, the Delegate shall vote on a
       case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
       long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
       industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,
       without limitation, five-year annual compound growth rates for sales,
       operating income, net income, and total shareholder returns (share price
       appreciation plus dividends). Other financial indicators that will be
       considered include margin analysis, cash flow, and debit levels.

    C. In analyzing CONTESTED ELECTIONS, the Delegate shall vote on a
       case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as the
       qualifications of all director nominees. The Delegate shall also
       consider the independence and attendance record of board and key
       committee members. A review of the corporate governance profile shall be
       completed highlighting entrenchment devices that may reduce
       accountability.

    D. In analyzing CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS, the Delegate shall vote on a
       case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as tax and
       economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
       incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
       changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
       supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and bundled
       or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

    E. In analyzing EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSALS and MANAGEMENT MATTERS,
       the Adviser shall vote on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration
       such factors as executive pay and spending on perquisites, particularly
       in conjunction with sub-par performance and employee layoffs.

    F. In analyzing PROXY CONTESTS FOR CONTROL, the Delegate shall vote on a
       case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
       financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
       management's track record; background to the proxy contest;
       qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation of what
       each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the
       proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership positions.

    G. A Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder SOCIAL MATTERS
       proposals.

IV Delegation.

    A. In the absence of a specific direction to the contrary from the Board of
       Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will be responsible for voting proxies
       for all Portfolio Holdings in accordance with this Statement of Policy,
       or for delegating such responsibility as described below.

    B. The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
       Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the best
       interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall accept
       direction or inappropriate influence from any other client, director or
       employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any vote
       inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the prior
       approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).

<PAGE>

    C. With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
       Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
       satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
       Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
       pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
       Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
       thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
       Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
       with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
       however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its own
       proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
       following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
       approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
       determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed to
       further the best economic interests of the affected Fund shareholders,
       and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and approved annually by
       the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will promptly notify the Adviser
       of any material changes to the Subadviser Procedures. The Adviser will
       periodically review the votes by the Subadviser for consistency with
       this Statement of Policy.

V. Conflicts of Interest

    A. The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived conflicts
       of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings between the
       interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of the Adviser,
       Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person of the Fund,
       on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into account a wide
       array of factors in determining whether such a conflict exists, whether
       such conflict is material in nature, and how to properly address or
       resolve the same.

    B. While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
       presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
       or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
       otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
       conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote) proxies
       pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the recommendations of an
       established, independent third party with qualifications to vote proxies
       such as Institutional Shareholder Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the
       recommendation of the proposing Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or
       (iv) where two or more Delegates provide conflicting requests, vote
       shares in proportion to the assets under management of the each
       proposing Delegate.

    C. The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
       actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
       recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
       shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
       any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
       of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
       Article.

    D. In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
       Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
       scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
       shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
       apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
       determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.

<PAGE>

VI.Miscellaneous.

    A. A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting
       and the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio
       Holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
       justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and available
       upon request.

    B. The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from this
       Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of
       Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of Trustees
       may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to the Fund or
       any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy voting pursuant to
       this Statement of Policy at such times and in such format or medium as
       the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser shall be solely
       responsible for complying with the disclosure and reporting requirements
       under applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation,
       Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser
       shall gather, collate and present information relating to the its proxy
       voting activities of those of each Delegate in such format and medium as
       the Fund shall determine from time to time in order for the Fund to
       discharge its disclosure and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule
       30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

    C. The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
       Portfolio Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting
       the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which such proxies
       were voted.

    D. The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
       committee established from time to time by the Adviser, as the case may
       be. In performing its duties hereunder, the Adviser, or any duly
       authorized committee, may engage the services of a research and/or
       voting adviser or agent, the cost of which shall be borne by such entity.

   This Statement of Policy shall be presented to the Board of Trustees
   annually for their amendment and/or approval.

      POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

      There may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in
      connection with the Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's management of each
      Fund's investments and the investments of any other accounts he manages.
      Such conflicts could arise from the aggregation of orders for all
      accounts managed by a particular portfolio manager, the allocation of
      purchases across all such accounts, the allocation of IPOs and any soft
      dollar arrangements that the Adviser may have in place that could benefit
      the Funds and/or such other accounts. The Board of Trustees/Directors has
      adopted on behalf of the Funds policies and procedures designed to
      address any such conflicts of interest to ensure that all transactions
      are executed in the best interest of the Funds' shareholders. The
      Advisers and Sub adviser are required to certify their compliance with
      these procedures to the Board of Trustees on a quarterly basis. There
      have been no material compliance issues with respect to any of these
      policies and procedures during the Funds' most recent fiscal year ended
      December 31, 2010. Additionally, there are no material conflicts of
      interest between the investment strategy of a Fund and the investment
      strategy of other accounts managed by Mr. Neel and Mr. Dickerson since
      portfolio managers generally manage funds and other accounts having
      similar investment strategies.

(A)(3)COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

      For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2010,
      following is a description of Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's compensation
      structure as portfolio managers of ZA and Euclid.

      Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. and its affiliated investment management
      firms (collectively, "Virtus"), believe that the firm's compensation
      program is adequate and competitive to attract and retain high-caliber
      investment professionals. Investment professionals at Virtus receive a
      competitive base salary, an incentive bonus opportunity and a benefits
      package. Portfolio managers may also have the opportunity to participate
      in long-term equity programs, including potential awards of Virtus
      restricted stock units ("RSUs") with multi-year vesting, subject to
      Virtus board approval.

      Following is a more detailed description of the compensation structure of
      the Fund's portfolio managers.

      Base Salary. Each Portfolio Manager is paid a fixed base salary, which is
      designed to be competitive in light of the individual's experience and
      responsibilities. Base salary is determined using compensation survey
      results of investment industry compensation conducted by an independent
      third party in evaluating competitive market compensation for its
      investment management professionals.

      Incentive Bonus. Annual incentive payments are based on targeted
      compensation levels, adjusted based on profitability, investment
      performance factors and a subjective assessment of contribution to the
      team effort. The short-term incentive payment is generally paid in cash,
      but a portion may be made in Virtus RSUs. Individual payments are
      assessed using comparisons of actual investment performance with specific
      peer group or index measures. Performance of the funds managed is
      generally measured over one-, three- and five year periods and an
      individual manager's participation is based on the performance of each
      fund/account managed.

      While portfolio manager compensation contains a performance component,
      this component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for
      managing within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary risk.
      This approach ensures that investment management personnel remain focused
      on managing and acquiring securities that correspond to a fund's mandate
      and risk profile and are discouraged from taking on more risk and
      unnecessary exposure to chase performance for personal gain. We believe
      we have appropriate controls in place to handle any potential conflicts
      that may result from a substantial portion of portfolio manager
      compensation being tied to performance

      Other Benefits. Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
      broad-based plans offered generally to employees of Virtus and its
      affiliates, including 401(k), health and other employee benefit plans.

      In summary, the Investment Manager believes that overall compensation is
      both fair and competitive while rewarding employees for not taking
      unnecessary risks to chase personal performance.

                        SENIOR MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS

I    Background

     Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that each registered
investment company disclose whether or not it has adopted a code of ethics that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the fund or a
third party (collectively, "Senior Management"). If a fund has not adopted such
a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so in certain regulatory
filings.

     Pursuant to various management agreements between The Zweig Fund, Inc. and
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") and Phoenix subsidiaries,
Phoenix employees currently serve as Senior Management to the Funds. As
employees of Phoenix they are subject to the Phoenix Code of Ethics (the "PCE").
The PCE complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other relevant
requirements. The Boards of Directors of the Funds, on October 1, 2003, adopted
the Phoenix Code of Ethics for the Senior Management of the Funds.

II   Board Resolution adopted on October 1, 2003

     WHEREAS, that Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that
each registered investment company publicly disclose whether or not it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals
are employed by the fund or a third party (collectively, "Senior Management");
and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
as presented at this meeting, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"Senior Management Code") and has determined the same to provide written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the
types of conduct by Senior Management that are contemplated by regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; now, therefore, be it

     RESOLVED, that the Fund does hereby approve and adopt the Senior Management
Code as the written code of ethics that applies to its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
individuals are employed by the Fund or a third party;

     FURTHER RESOLVED, the Chairman of the Fund, with the advice of counsel and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
shall be appointed and directed to oversee the consideration and granting of any
waivers of the Senior Management Code with respect to Senior Management other
than the Chairman provided however that the Chairman shall provide notice of any
such waiver to the Board of Directors at the next succeeding regularly scheduled
meeting of the Board of Directors and provided further that any requested
waivers involving the Chairman shall be presented to the Board for approval; and

     FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Compliance Officer of The Phoenix
Companies, Inc. be, and she or he hereby is, authorized and directed to
implement, and oversee compliance with, and administration of the Senior
Management Code and to take such further action and

<PAGE>


deliver and execute any and all instruments, certificates and documents as she
or he may deem necessary or appropriate, with the advice of counsel, to fully
carry out the purposes and intent of the Senior Management Code.

Commitment to Shareholders

Phoenix is committed to providing shareholder value. One way we do this is by
observing the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct in all of our
business dealings.

Conflicts of Interest

Phoenix expects each of its employees and directors to maintain the highest
moral and ethical standards and to avoid conflicts of interest in conducting
business activities. A "conflict of interest" occurs when an individual's
private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, in any way with the
interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an
employee or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee or director, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her
position in the Company.

An employee requested by Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another
company owes a fiduciary duty to Phoenix as well as to the company on whose
board of directors he or she serves. Where conflicts of interest arise between
the interests of Phoenix and the other company, the employee should consult
Phoenix's General Counsel for guidance. Moreover, no employee requested by
Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another company may accept fees or
other compensation for board service. In the event the company for which an
employee serves as a director requires directors to receive fees, any
remuneration received by the employee must be donated to a charitable
organization. The Company will offset any tax consequences incurred by the
employee.

All conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing to the Chief Compliance
Officer. Employees and directors are required to file a Conflict of Interest
Statement annually. Any conflicts of interest that arise following completion of
the Conflict of Interest Statement must be promptly reported to the Chief
Compliance Officer in writing.

Corporate Opportunities

Employees and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate
interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently, employees and
directors are prohibited from engaging in the following activities:

..    taking for themselves personal opportunities that are discovered through
     the use of corporate property, information or position;

..    using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and

..    competing with the Company.

Insider Trading and Personal Trading

Federal securities laws and Company policy prohibit the purchase or sale of
securities while in possession of material non-public information and prohibit
passing such information on to others. No employee or director may buy or sell
Phoenix securities if he or she has material non-public information. This
restriction also applies to an employee's or director's spouse, other adults
living in the employee's or director's household, minor children and persons for
whom the employee exercises investment authority. Employees, directors and their
family members also must avoid passing non-public information on to third
parties.

<PAGE>


Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would probably consider the
information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of the
company to which the information relates.

Directors, officers and their family members1 are also subject to certain
restrictions under New York Insurance Law governing acquisition of Phoenix
shares. Until June 25, 2006, directors and officers, whether acting directly or
indirectly, may only acquire, or offer to acquire, such shares: (i) through a
Phoenix plan; or (ii) through a registered broker or dealer at quoted prices on
the date of purchase. Family members may only acquire such shares through the
latter method.

All directors, all employees with a title of Vice President or higher, plus
certain other employees whose positions place them in regular contact with
non-public information, and certain family members of all of them are subject to
a further restriction as well: these individuals may only buy or sell Phoenix
securities during "window" periods. You have been or will be notified: (i) if
these restrictions apply to you; and (ii) when periods begin and end.

In addition, officers with a title of Executive Vice President or higher,
certain other individuals who have been notified by the Corporate Secretary, and
certain family members of each of them, must pre-clear all transactions in
Phoenix securities through our Corporate Secretary. Further, they must promptly
report such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

No employee or director may buy or sell securities of another company with the
knowledge that those securities are being considered for purchase or sale by
Phoenix, any of its subsidiaries or any of the Company's advisory accounts. In
the case of any company in which Phoenix owns 10 percent or more of the
outstanding equity, no employee (nor certain family members) may make any
personal investment without prior approval from the Law Department.

Certain employees who are involved with the Company's investment adviser and
broker-dealer operations may be required to secure pre-clearance of and/or
report all personal securities transactions by these individuals. In addition,
the Company reserves the right to require duplicate confirmations, quarterly
transaction reports and prior clearance for any personal securities transactions
by those individuals. If you have any question as to whether your position
requires pre-clearance or reporting, you should contact the compliance officer
for your business area (investment adviser or broker-dealer) or the Corporate
Compliance Department.

Footnote 1 An officer's or director's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,
step-parent, grandparent, spouse, or sibling, including in-laws and adoptive
relationships.

Market Timing

Company policy prohibits employees from engaging in excessive trading or market
timing activities with respect to any mutual fund, regardless of whether such
mutual fund is affiliated with the Company. This prohibition does not apply to
money market funds or other funds designed to permit short term investment or to
non-volitional investment vehicles such as 401(k) plans, automatic reinvestment
programs, or asset allocation programs.

Confidentiality

Directors and employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of
information entrusted to them in the course of their work for the Company.
Disclosure of confidential information is restricted to authorized persons or
situations in which disclosure is legally mandated. Confidential information
includes all non-public information about the Company or persons with which it
conducts business (such as customers, vendors and potential investment targets)
including, but not limited to: internal operating procedures; investment
strategies; sales data and customer lists; financial plans; projections; and
clients' personal information. (See also Privacy and Confidential Personal
Information below). A director's or employee's obligation to protect
confidential information continues even after termination of his or her position
with the Company.

<PAGE>


Protection and Use of Company Property and Assets

Employees have access to Company property to assist them in effectively carrying
out their duties to the Company. Company property should only be used for
legitimate purposes. All employees should protect the Company's property and
ensure its efficient use. Theft, fraud, carelessness and waste have a direct
impact on the Company's profitability.

Examples of Company property include proprietary and non-public information,
equipment, facilities, vehicles, funds and other assets. Improper use or abuse
of Company property is prohibited. Expenses to be paid for by the Company, via
reimbursement or direct payment, are limited to those expenses that are
authorized and related to legitimate business activities.

Contract Review

The following contracts must be reviewed by the Law Department prior to being
signed, amended or terminated early:

..    Contracts that involve an expenditure or value of greater than $25,000;

..    Contracts that pose significant legal obligations on Phoenix (such as an
     obligation not to solicit business, not to hire, or to provide
     indemnification); and

..    Contracts that involve employment or consulting services.

In addition, contracts that could have a significant impact on Phoenix's
financial results or reports must be reviewed by Corporate Finance for business
risks and financial implications.

Corporate Disclosures

As a public company, Phoenix is required to publicly disclose certain
information on a regular basis. This includes financial information and other
material information about the Company. It is imperative that such information
be disseminated in a consistent manner and in accordance with SEC disclosure
requirements and Company policy. In order to ensure that information released is
accurate and properly disseminated, only certain individuals are authorized to
speak on behalf of the Company. Employees are prohibited from speaking with
rating agencies, analysts, investors or the press without obtaining prior
authorization from the President and Chief Executive Officer. Employees
receiving any such inquiries should refer such individuals to the appropriate
area for response:

..    Members of the Press - to the senior officer, Corporate Communications;

..    Rating Agencies - to any officer in the Rating Agency Relations unit; and

..    Securities Analysts and Investors - to any officer in the Investor
     Relations unit.

In order to enable the Company to comply with applicable law, Company policy
prohibits directors and employees from publicly disclosing any non-public
information about the Company's financial performance, other than at times and
through methods approved by the Company's President or Chief Financial Officer.
Employees are also prohibited from commenting on the Company's stock
performance.

Accuracy and Retention of Company Records

The integrity of Phoenix's records is vital to the Company's continued success.
The falsification, misuse or inappropriate alteration of Company documents is
strictly prohibited. Phoenix's business transactions must be accurately recorded
on the Company's books and records in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, any other required accounting basis and established
Company policy. Financial information must fairly represent all relevant
information.

The retention and destruction of Company records must follow established Company
policies and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

<PAGE>


Commitment to Customers

Phoenix upholds its commitment to our customers by conducting our business
fairly and honestly and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all
dealings with customers.

Safeguarding Customer Assets

Employees have an obligation to safeguard the assets of our customers at all
times, and to protect them from all forms of misuse. Misappropriation of funds
can include theft, fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized borrowing. Employees must
not, under any circumstances, misappropriate funds, property or other assets, or
assist another individual in doing so.

Ethical Market Conduct

The Company expects all who are involved in the sales and marketing of its
products and services to abide by the following principles:

..    conduct business according to high standards of honesty and fairness;

..    provide competent and customer-focused sales and service;

..    engage in active and fair competition;

..    provide clear, honest and fair advertising and sales materials;

..    handle customer complaints and disputes in an appropriate and timely
     manner; and

..    monitor sales and service procedures to help ensure compliance with ethical
     market conduct.

Privacy and Confidential Personal Information

It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain the privacy of
confidential personal information. Confidential personal information includes
non-public financial and health information obtained from consumers and
customers in connection with providing a financial product or service. Specific
examples of confidential personal information include information concerning
assets, income, businesses, estates, financial plans or health.

The misuse of confidential personal information could subject the Company and
its employees to civil liability or criminal penalties. Before releasing
confidential information to anyone, employees must make certain that releasing
it is permitted under the Company's policies or authorized in writing by the
person to whom it relates.

Customer Complaints

The Company is committed to fairly and expeditiously handling all customer
complaints. All complaints must be handled and reported in accordance with
established corporate policies as well as procedures established for the
applicable business unit or affiliate. To facilitate resolution of each customer
complaint, as well as to facilitate any related regulatory inquiries, all
customer complaints and related communications are centrally retained.

Fraud

The Company strongly supports all efforts to detect and prevent fraud. It
believes that only through aggressive action to combat fraud can the Company
continue to meet its fundamental obligations to its stockholders and customers.
When there is reason to believe that the Company has been the target of fraud or
attempted fraud, it will aggressively work with the appropriate law enforcement
officials to seek prosecution and conviction of the responsible individual(s).
Any employee who is aware or suspects that the Company has been the target of
fraud or attempted fraud should report it to the Corporate Audit Department
immediately.

<PAGE>


Insurance Anti-Fraud Plan

In accordance with insurance regulatory requirements, the Company has a
comprehensive insurance anti-fraud plan that is designed to:

..    prevent insurance fraud, including internal fraud involving the Company's
     officers, employees or agents, fraud resulting from misrepresentations on
     applications for insurance, and claims fraud;

..    report insurance fraud to appropriate law enforcement and regulatory
     authorities;

..    encourage cooperation in the prosecution of insurance fraud cases; and

..    aggressively pursue recovery of all sums improperly paid by the Company as
     a result of fraud.

Commitment to Corporate Citizenship

Phoenix is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, which includes
complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we
operate as well as engaging in fair competition in the marketplace.

Complying with Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The Company expects all employees to conduct business in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations related to the
financial services industry are complex, thus placing a duty on each employee to
take all reasonable steps to ensure his or her actions are in compliance.
Compliance with the law does not, however, comprise our entire ethical
responsibility. Rather, it is a minimum standard for performance of our duties.
(See also the provisions below on Commitment to Ethics and Compliance).

Accounting, Internal Accounting Controls and Auditing Matters

The Company treats complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls, or
auditing matters seriously and expeditiously. Employees have the opportunity to
submit confidential and anonymous complaints about accounting or auditing
matters for review by representatives of Phoenix, and if appropriate, the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors. These complaints will be handled in a
manner that protects the confidentiality and anonymity of the employee when so
requested by the employee. (See the Toll-Free Help Line section of this Code, on
page 11).

No employee will be terminated or otherwise retaliated against for submitting a
complaint under this procedure if he or she reasonably believes that the
complaint may involve a violation of federal securities or anti-fraud laws.

Fair Dealing

Each employee must deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone
through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information,
misrepresentation of material facts, or other unfair-dealing practice.

Antitrust

The Company is committed to preserving a free and competitive marketplace and
will not engage in any understandings or agreements with any competitor that
could result in a restraint of trade. Employees must avoid engaging in any
conduct that violates the antitrust laws, such as agreements with competitors
regarding prices, terms of sale, division of markets and allocations of
customers. Discussions with competitors related to market share, projected sales
for any specific product or service, revenues and expenses, production
schedules, unannounced products and services, pricing or marketing strategies
are prohibited.

The antitrust laws and, thus, the above prohibitions, also apply to informal
contacts with competitors, such as encounters at trade shows or meetings of
professional organizations. Every employee has an obligation to avoid situations
that could result in a violation of the antitrust laws.

Anti-Money Laundering

<PAGE>


It is the responsibility of every employee to protect the Company from
exploitation by individuals engaged in money laundering activities. Accordingly,
affected employees must:

..    become familiar with the anti-money laundering laws and their requirements
     as applied to the Company; and

..    learn and fully comply with the Company's anti-money laundering policies
     and procedures.

Failure to comply with applicable laws or the Company's policies may result in
significant criminal and civil penalties for the Company as well as for those
individuals involved. Furthermore, even association with money laundering
activity could subject both the Company and its employees to civil and criminal
penalties.

Lobbying and Political Contributions

Lobbying is generally defined as communicating with a public official, or a
member of his or her staff, in the legislative or executive branch of
government, for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action.
Lobbying is highly regulated and lobbyists are required to be registered and to
report their activities. No employee may engage in lobbying on behalf of Phoenix
without prior permission of the Law Department. The giving of gifts to local
public officials and members of their staff, whether in the form of meals,
tickets to events or otherwise, is strictly regulated by most states and by the
federal government. Special restrictions also apply to employees who provide
investment management services to public entities.

Employees must be careful to distinguish between personal and corporate
political activities. Unless specifically requested by the Company to
communicate on its behalf on a particular issue, you should identify
communications with legislators as expressing your own personal beliefs and not
those of Phoenix. The use of Phoenix stationery for any personal political
communication is prohibited. Any employee wishing to be a candidate for elective
office should consult with his or her supervisor and department head in advance.

Questions regarding the Company's position on proposed legislation or
regulations should be directed to Government Relations or the Law Department.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits the payment or authorization of the
payment of any money, or the giving of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of:

..    influencing any act or decision of the foreign official; or

..    inducing the foreign official to use his influence to assist in obtaining
     business for or directing business to any person.

A "foreign official" is any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of a
foreign government, agency, department or instrumentality. Also included under
the term "foreign official" are foreign political parties, officials of
political parties and candidates for foreign political office.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to all directors, employees and agents
of the Company. Violation of the act can result in both fines and imprisonment.

Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents

Employees must avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others.
Intellectual property includes copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents
and trade secrets. Improper use includes copying, distributing or modifying
third party copyrighted materials without permission. Infringement may result in
criminal as well as civil liabilities for Phoenix and its employees.

The Company has an agreement with the Copyright Clearance Center that gives a
license to Phoenix employees to make photocopies of many publications for
business purposes. Questions about the types of copying that are covered by the
agreement should be directed to the Corporate Compliance Department.

<PAGE>


Commitment to Employees

Phoenix's employees are our most important asset and we are committed to
fostering a work environment in which employees have the opportunity to grow,
contribute and participate free from discrimination.

Equal Opportunity

The Company employs and promotes on the basis of merit and achievement without
regard to age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, marital status, or disability. This policy applies to every phase
of the employment process and every aspect of the employment relationship:
recruitment, hiring, training, promotions, transfers, terminations, benefits,
compensation and participation in Company-sponsored educational, social and
recreational programs.

Sexual Harassment

The Company prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment
includes: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal, visual or physical conduct when:

..    submission is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a
     person's employment;

..    submission to or rejection of inappropriate conduct by an employee is used
     as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or

..    the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
     individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
     offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment also includes: unwelcome sexual flirtations and advances;
verbal abuse of a sexual nature; inappropriate touching; graphic or verbal
comments about an individual's body; displaying in the workplace a sexually
suggestive object or picture; and sexually explicit or offensive jokes.

Employment of Relatives

Except in the limited circumstances described in this section, the Company does
not permit the employment of a director's or employee's "relative", which term
includes a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, step-parent,
step-child, step-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece,
or first cousin including in-laws. Specifically, the Company prohibits the
hiring of a "relative" of any director or officer, or of any employee working in
the Corporate Audit, Corporate Compliance, Human Resources or Law Departments.
Although this policy does not require the termination of any employee who
becomes related to a person described in the preceding sentence through a
post-hiring event such as marriage or a promotion, any employee who becomes
"related" through such an occurrence should promptly advise his or her
supervisor. The Company will then take steps to assure that no employee reports
to or supervises a relative and that related employees do not work in the same
department or report to the same supervisor. The employment of a "relative" of
any officer at the level of Executive Vice President or higher will not be
permitted or accommodated even if the relationship results from a post-hiring
event.

Workplace Safety

The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment that is safe and
healthy for its employees and others. All job-related injuries or illnesses
should be reported immediately to your supervisor or Human Resources
representative. Questions concerning health and safety matters should also be
referred to one of them.

The Company does not tolerate acts of violence or threats of violence against
employees or Company property. Possession of firearms or other weapons anywhere
on Company property or while conducting Company business is prohibited. Any
situation or concern involving violent

<PAGE>


behavior or the threat of violence should be immediately reported to Security or
Human Resources.

Drugs and Alcohol

The sale, purchase, use, possession or transfer of narcotics or other legally
controlled substances by employees while on Company premises or on Company
business (other than use of prescription drugs in accordance with a physician's
orders) is prohibited. Employees attending functions on behalf of the Company
where alcohol is served are expected to use good judgment and avoid consuming
excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages.

Felony Convictions

Federal law prohibits the employment by an insurance company, without the
consent of the appropriate state insurance department, of any person convicted
of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust. To assist the Company in
fulfilling its responsibilities under this law, employees are required to
disclose any felony conviction to the Company at the time of application for
employment. Any employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony must report
this fact to the Company immediately.

Employee Ownership of Phoenix Stock

Employees and directors are subject to various requirements governing their
ownership of Company stock, including federal securities law and New York
insurance law. Please refer to the Insider Trading and Personal Trading section
of this Code (at page 1) for more information.

Commitment to Ethics and Compliance

A strong commitment to business ethics and compliance is the foundation of a
successful organization. Every employee is expected to carry out the Company's
business activities in an ethical manner and in a fashion consistent with
applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidelines.

Ethical Decision Making

Phoenix's success is dependent on each of us applying the highest ethical
standards to whatever we do on behalf of the Company. Employees should consider
the following questions before making decisions.

..    Is my action consistent with approved Company practices?

..    Is my action consistent with the Company's values?

..    Does my action give the appearance of impropriety?

..    Can I, in good conscience, defend my action to my supervisor, other
     employees and the general public?

..    Does my action meet my personal code of ethical behavior?

..    Does my action conform to the spirit of these and all other applicable
     guidelines?

Monitoring Code Compliance

The Corporate Compliance and the Corporate Audit Departments are responsible for
monitoring the compliance activities of all areas of the Company and for
ensuring that this Code of Conduct is being followed. Compliance will be
monitored by periodic audits where appropriate. Additionally, the Company's
Chief Compliance Officer must report annually to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors on the level of compliance with our requirement that each
employee and director complete the Code of Conduct Acknowledgement and the
Conflict of Interest Declaration. Waivers of violations of the Code by directors
or by officers with a title of Senior Vice President or higher may only be
granted by the Audit Committee or the Board. Such waivers must be promptly
reported to shareholders. All other waivers, which may be granted by

<PAGE>


the Chief Compliance Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President,
shall be reported to the Audit Committee but need not be reported to the
shareholders.

Toll-Free Help Line

Phoenix maintains a confidential, 24-hour, toll-free telephone help line for
employees for the purpose of requesting assistance concerning, or reporting
violations of, this Code or reporting complaints about accounting or auditing
matters. The number is: 1-800-813-8180.

Assistance is available during regular business hours. If you call outside of
regular business hours, you may leave a confidential message and your call will
be returned the following business day. Special security measures have been
taken with this help line to ensure confidentiality. If you wish to remain
anonymous, you may request a case identification number and refer to that number
in subsequent phone calls.

Obligation to Report

Employees are obligated to report suspected violations of this Code to their
department head, the Chief Compliance Officer or the Law Department.

Whistleblower Protection

No retaliation or retribution of any kind will be taken against an employee who,
in good faith, reports a suspected violation of this Code.

Investigation

All allegations of suspected violations will be promptly investigated and
appropriate action will be taken. Investigations will be conducted in an
objective, professional manner. The specifics of an investigation, including the
identity of the individual reporting the information, will be kept confidential
except as such disclosure is necessary to fully investigate the allegations,
facilitate resolution and/or report the results to appropriate authorities.

Disclosure to Government Authorities

Certain actions and omissions prohibited by this Code may also violate criminal
laws and may subject violators to criminal prosecution. The Law Department will
review the results of investigations that indicate potential violations of
criminal law and recommend to the appropriate senior officers whether disclosure
to appropriate enforcement authorities is warranted.

Disciplinary Action for Violations

Failure to adhere to this Code, other Company policies or applicable laws or
government regulations may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Situations in which disciplinary action may be
appropriate include the following, insofar as they relate to conduct of the
Company's business:

..    authorization of or participation in activities that violate the law,
     government regulations, this Code or other Company policies;

..    retaliation, direct or indirect, or encouragement of others to retaliate
     against a Company employee who reports a suspected violation;

..    failure to cooperate with an investigation of suspected violations,
     including interfering with or obstructing an investigation; and

..    failure to report a suspected violation of the law, government regulations,
     this Code or other Company policies.
