Series G - Letter to Members
as of March 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC -
Series G ("Multi-Strategy" or the "Portfolio") was up 4.96% annualized since its
inception in January 2003. For the same time period, the S&P 500 was up 15.97%,
while the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index was up 3.53%.

COMMENTARY
- ----------

March was a difficult month for hedge funds, with the exception of fixed-income
arbitrage strategies. All major global equity markets were down while fixed
income markets were mainly unchanged. The macro environment saw rising oil
prices, inflationary worries, and increasing interest rates. Global macro
managers struggled as sharp reversals in many markets made directional trading
difficult. Long/short equity managers were generally down for the month.
Convertible arbitrage strategies continued to underperform amidst falling equity
prices, widening credit spreads, and continued redemptions. Distressed debt
managers were generally down as spreads widened by 79 basis points ("bps") from
285 bps to 364 bps. Fixed income arbitrage strategies performed well as they
benefited from a widening of spreads among credit, emerging markets, swaps and
mortgages.

QUARTERLY OUTLOOK
- -----------------

The first quarter of 2005 was generally difficult for both traditional and
alternative money managers. Volatility remained stubbornly low and most markets
finished at or close to their low points of 2005. Whereas in recent years such
performance has generally been attributed to geopolitical risks, such as
terrorism and the War in Iraq, this past quarter was relatively quiet in terms
of external events. What proved challenging to markets last quarter, however,
were the risks posed to economic growth by the withdrawal of monetary and other
economic stimuli. Central banks across the globe have been steadily increasing
shortterm interest rates and reducing liquidity, and none have been as
aggressive as the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (the "Fed"). Over the past year, the
Fed has raised interest rates seven times, moving the Fed Funds Rate from 1.00%
to 2.75%. Moreover, commodity prices, in particular energy, have continued to
surge. Crude oil, for example, has surged from $43 a barrel to over $55 in the
past three months. As demand for most energy products is relatively inelastic,
this has acted in effect as a consumption tax and a withdrawal of liquidity.

Nevertheless, corporations, consumers and governments alike are doing what they
can to offset the deleterious effects of this withdrawal of liquidity. Consumers
are withdrawing equity from their homes while lowering monthly payments by
assuming interest rate risk. Corporations are actively buying and selling each
other in search of cost savings and synergy. Governments are spending, cutting
taxes and running up large deficits. All of these beneficiaries of the recent
monetary and credit expansion have been successful thus far in staving off the
effects of monetary tightening. This has lead some to believe that the current
deceleration will be transitory in nature and that both stronger growth and
earnings are in the offing in the second half of this year. Somewhat
contradictory is that it is also expected that the monetary contraction under
way will continue and conditions will be even more restrictive. As growth seems
to be a largely monetary phenomenon, it would seem unlikely that it will re-
accelerate as rates rise. In the short term, these conflicting influences have
made markets choppy, directionless and frustrating. In the long term, it makes
them vulnerable to potential dislocations and economic disappointment.

The divergence between short-term and long-term prospects poses challenges for
money managers of all stripes, hedge fund managers being no exception. While no
longer being able to rely on beta as a steady source of returns as market
direction seems unclear, dramatic capital inflows into hedge funds and other
absolute return strategies have made their pursuit of alpha more competitive and
difficult. It has never been

Series G - Letter to Members

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

more important to invest with the right managers and in the right strategies,
which is what the Investment Manager will continue to focus on going forward.

TACTICAL VIEW
- -------------

GLOBAL MACRO: POSITIVE

The macro community remains divided on the likely direction of interest rates
and currencies in the short term. Both markets remain in transition leaving room
for some significant moves and therefore opportunities in the quarters to come.

LONG/SHORT EQUITY: NEUTRAL

Global equity markets generally had a difficult first quarter, as did most
long/short managers. If this continues, long short managers will have to
scramble to generate alpha and not be able to rely on beta as a significant
source of returns.

EQUITY ARBITRAGE: POSITIVE

Volatility picked up in the first quarter, which helped most managers in this
strategy. Equity arbitrage managers should benefit if this trend continues.

CONVERTIBLE ARBITRAGE: NEUTRAL

The pick up in volatility was a welcomed relief for most managers but
unfortunately it was accompanied by a widening of credit spreads. Both of these
developments were relatively modest in scope and largely offsetting. As the tug
of war continues, managers will continue to face a challenging environment.

DISTRESSED: NEUTRAL

Spreads widened and rates increased modestly during the quarter, hurting many
distressed managers. Whether it was just a much needed correction or the
beginning of a reversal remains to be seen. Either way, spreads still remain
tight, and the risks remain negatively skewed.

MERGER ARBITRAGE/MULTI-STRATEGY EVENT: POSITIVE

The corporate transaction market remains active and provides an excellent
backdrop for managers using this strategy.

FIXED INCOME ARBITRAGE: NEUTRAL

Uncertainty about the direction of interest rates remains both an opportunity
and challenge for most fixed income managers, as is the widening of mortgage
spreads for most mortgage managers.

investment in the Portfolio. Investing in hedge funds is speculative, not
suitable for all clients, and intended for investors with sufficient knowledge
and experience who are willing to bear the high economic risks of the
investment, which can include:

o     loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging,
      short-selling or other speculative investment practices;

o     lack of liquidity in that there may be no secondary market for the fund
      and none expected to develop;

o     volatility of returns;

o     restrictions on transferring interests in the fund;

o     absence of information regarding valuations and pricing;

o     delays in tax reporting;

o     less regulation and higher fees than mutual funds; and

o     manager risk.

Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
LLC-Multi-Strategy Series G

We have  audited  the  accompanying  statement  of  assets  and  liabilities  of
Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge  Fund   Portfolios

two-year  period  ended  March 31,  2005 and the  period  from  January  1, 2003
(commencement of operations) to March 31, 2003.  These financial  statements and
financial  highlights  are the  responsibility  of the  Fund's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company

and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included verification of
investments owned as of March 31, 2005, by inspection of investment subscription
documents and  confirmation  with  underlying  investment  funds.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge  Fund   Portfolios
LLC-Multi-Strategy Series G, as of March 31, 2005, the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members' capital

highlights  for each of the  years in the  two-year  period  then  ended and the
period  from  January 1, 2003  through  March 31, 2003 in  conformity  with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION

            Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge   Fund
            Portfolios LLC ("the  Company") was organized as a Delaware  Limited
            Liability  Company on August 16,  2002.  The  Company is  registered
            under  the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act")  as
            amended,  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment
            company.  The Company is also registered under the Securities Act of
            1933 ("1933  Act").  The Company  consists of two  separate  series,
            Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  (each  a
            "Series").   The  financial   statements  included  herein  are  for
            Multi-Strategy  Series G. The investment objective of Multi-Strategy
            Series G is to  achieve  capital  appreciation  principally  through
            investing  in  investment  funds  ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by
            third-party investment managers ("Investment  Managers") that employ
            a variety of alternative  investment  strategies.  These  investment
            strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage
            or   short-side   positions   to   take   advantage   of   perceived
            inefficiencies  across  the global  markets,  often  referred  to as
            "alternative"   strategies.   Because   Investment  Funds  following
            alternative  investment  strategies  are  often  described  as hedge
            funds,  the  investment  program of  Multi-Strategy  Series G can be
            described as a fund of hedge funds.

            Units of  Multi-Strategy  Series G are  sold to  eligible  investors
            (referred  to as  "Members").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in
            Multi-Strategy Series G from each Member is $25,000 (and was $50,000
            from  January 1, 2003 to November 1, 2003);  the minimum  additional
            investment is $10,000.

            Citigroup Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI" or "the "Adviser"),  a
            Delaware  limited  liability  company  and  indirect,  wholly  owned
            subsidiary of Citigroup Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
            investment  adviser.  The  Adviser is  registered  as an  investment
            adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and,
            among  other  things,   is   responsible   for  the   allocation  of
            Multi-Strategy Series G's assets to various Investment Funds. AMACAR
            Partners, Inc. is the managing member of Multi-Strategy Series G and
            has delegated  substantially all authority to oversee the management
            of the operations and assets of Multi-Strategy Series G to the Board
            of Directors.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            Investments  in  Investment  Funds are  subject  to the terms of the
            respective limited partnership agreements, limited liability company
            agreements and offering  memoranda.  Multi-Strategy  Series G values
            these  investments at fair value based on financial data supplied by
            the Investment Funds.

            A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The net asset value of  Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of
            the close of  business at the end of each month in  accordance  with
            the  valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be  determined
            from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the Board of
            Directors.

MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2005 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  investments  in  Investment  Funds  are
            carried at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
            pro-rata  interest in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All
            valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
            Fund and are net of management  and  performance  incentive  fees or
            other  allocations  payable to the  Investment  Funds'  managers  as
            required  by  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment
            Manager  to  which  the   Adviser   allocates   assets  will  charge
            Multi-Strategy  Series G, as  investor in an  underlying  Investment
            Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the Investment Managers
            will  receive  performance-based  compensation  in  the  form  of an
            incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of the Investment  Managers are
            generally expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the net assets
            under their  management and the incentive fee is generally  expected
            to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

            As a general  matter,  the fair value of  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
            investment  in  an  Investment   Fund  represents  the  amount  that
            Multi-Strategy  Series G can  reasonably  expect to receive  from an
            Investment  Fund  if  Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  investment  were
            redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available at
            the time.  The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions
            ranging from monthly to annually. Investment Funds generally require
            advance notice of a Member's intent to redeem its interest, and may,
            depending on the Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or
            delay a redemption request.  Multi-Strategy Series G does not take a
            liquidity  discount on any  Investment  Funds held.  The  underlying
            investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value
            as described in each Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.  The
            Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their assets in restricted
            securities and other investments that are illiquid.

            B.    FUND EXPENSES

            Multi-Strategy Series G bears all expenses incurred in the course of
            its operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all
            costs and expenses  related to portfolio  transactions and positions
            for Multi-Strategy  Series G's account;  professional fees; costs of
            insurance;  registration  expenses;  and expenses of meetings of the
            Board of Directors.  Costs  incurred in connection  with the initial
            offering were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of
            operations;  costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy Series
            G's  subsequent  registration  under the 1933 Act have been deferred
            and were  amortized  over the  twelve  months  commencing  after the
            effective date of such registration statement.

            C.    INCOME TAXES

            Multi-Strategy   Series  G   currently   intends  to  operate  as  a
            partnership and not as an association or publicly traded partnership
            taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Each
            Member will be required to report on his,  her or its own annual tax
            return the Member's  distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series G's
            taxable income or loss.

            D.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank,
            N.A.  account that pays money market rates and are  accounted for at
            cost plus accrued interest.

            E.    CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

            Contributions   received   in  advance  of   $2,340,925   represents
            subscriptions  received to be credited to Members'  capital accounts
            on April 1,  2005.  Such  amount is  included  within the short term
            investments  balance as  depicted  on the  accompanying  schedule of
            investments.

            F.    RECEIVABLE FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

            Receivable from investment funds of $22,060,190  represents  amounts
            due to  Multi-Strategy  Series G for sales of  interests  in certain
            investment funds.

            G.    USE OF ESTIMATES

            The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with U.S.
            generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Adviser to
            make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
            the  financial   statements  and  accompanying  notes.  The  Adviser
            believes  that the  estimates  utilized in preparing  Multi-Strategy
            Series G's financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however,
            actual results could differ from these estimates.

      3.    MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
            OTHER

            CAI, as Adviser,  provides  certain  management  and  administrative
            services to Multi-Strategy  Series G. CAI acts primarily to evaluate
            and select Investment Managers, to allocate assets, to establish and
            apply risk management procedures,  and to monitor overall investment
            performance.  In addition,  CAI also provides office space and other
            support services. In consideration for such services, Multi-Strategy
            Series G will pay the  Adviser  a  monthly  management  fee equal to
            0.188%  (2.25%  on an  annualized  basis)  of end of month  Members'
            capital.  The  Adviser  will  pay  a  portion  of  the  fee  to  its
            affiliates.

            A reduction  in the  management  fee to 1.5% of net assets  annually
            (from 2.25%  annually for  Multi-Strategy  Series G) was approved by
            the Board of Directors to be effective August 1, 2005.

            In addition,  CAI allocated  certain  marketing  related expenses of
            $49,315 to  Multi-Strategy  Series G during the year ended March 31,
            2005.

            Placement  agents may be  retained  by the  Company to assist in the
            placement of Units. A placement  agent  affiliated  with the Adviser
            will  generally  be entitled to receive a fee from each  investor in
            the Company whose Units the agent places. The specific amount of the
            placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent
            on the size of the investment in a Series. Placement agents may also
            be reimbursed  by the Company with respect to certain  out-of-pocket
            expenses.

            Citigroup Global Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
            wholly owned  subsidiary  of Citigroup,  Inc.  serves as a placement
            agent of the Multi-Strategy Series G Units. For the year ended March
            31, 2005, CGM earned  $1,085,065 in placement fees on Multi-Strategy
            Series G Units.  Such fees are  deducted  from an  investor's  gross
            contribution amount.

            The Company has entered into agreements with third parties to act as
            additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  G Units.
            Placement  fees may range from 0 to 3%. In  addition,  the  Adviser,
            and/or its affiliates,  will pay the placement agents an annual fee,
            payable monthly in arrears. The fee shall be paid from the Adviser's
            own resources (or those of its affiliates).

            Multi-Strategy  Series G pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on
            an annualized basis) for administration based primarily upon average
            net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,  and will  reimburse
            certain  expenses.  CAI, as  Administrator,  has retained  PFPC Inc.
            ("PFPC"), an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of
            The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
            its administrative duties. PFPC provides certain accounting,  record
            keeping, tax and investor related services.

            Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of the Company,  as
            defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
            a fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $500.  Such  Director
            fees are  allocated to each series  pro-rata,  based on the relative
            net  assets  of each  series.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested
            person"  does not receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.
            All  Directors  are  reimbursed  for all  reasonable  out of  pocket
            expenses.   Total   amounts   expensed   related  to   Directors  by
            Multi-Strategy  Series G for the year  ended  March  31,  2005  were
            $25,483.

            PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as custodian of
            Multi-Strategy Series G's assets and provides custodial services for
            Multi-Strategy   Series  G.  Fees  payable  to  the   custodian  and
            reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series
            G.

            Series  G.  The  Board  of  Directors  from  time to time and in its
            complete  and   exclusive   discretion,   may   determine  to  cause
            Multi-Strategy Series G to repurchase Units from Members pursuant to
            written  tenders by Members on such terms and  conditions  as it may
            determine. CAI expects that it typically will recommend to the Board
            of Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Units from Members
            quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31
            (or,  if any such date is not a  business  day,  on the  immediately
            preceding business day).

            Net  profits  or net  losses  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G for each
            month-end will be allocated among and credited to or debited against
            the capital accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month
            in accordance with the Members'  respective  investment  percentages
            for the month.

APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S ADVISORY AGREEMENT BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
(UNAUDITED)

      The  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  between the  Company  and  Citigroup
Alternative Investments LLC as investment adviser to each of Series M and Series
G was approved by the initial  Member of each Series on November 27, 2002 and by
the Board of Directors most recently on September 10, 2004 (with  Management Fee
reductions applicable to each Series subsequently approved on March 11, 2005, as
described  below).  The Board of  Directors  anticipates  next  considering  the
Investment Advisory Agreement before November 2005.

      In approving the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement in September  2004,  the
Board of Directors  considered  the  Company's  existing  relationship  with the
Adviser and its affiliates,  as well as the ongoing commitment of the Adviser to
the Company. The Directors also considered Series investment performance to date
and  the  resources  and  experience  of the  Adviser,  its  affiliates  and the
individuals  dedicated to the Company's  investment program. In this regard, the
Directors  reviewed  materials  relevant to the  investment  performance  of the
Company and the Adviser, as well as various materials describing the Adviser and
its personnel.  They evaluated these factors in light of the nature,  extent and
quality  of  the  services  provided  by the  Adviser,  the  total  compensation
received,  directly or indirectly,  by the Adviser from the Company (no indirect
compensation,  such  as  through  soft  dollar  arrangements  or  other  service
benefits,  was  identified)  and the  total  cost to the  Company  of using  the
Adviser's  services,  taking into account both expenses borne by the Adviser and
those  that may be passed to the  Company  by the  Adviser.  In  addition,  they
compared competitive prices for comparable  services,  reviewing fee information
for a variety of  investment  funds  similar in structure to the Company.  Among
other things,  the Directors  determined the Adviser's fees were  competitive to
those charged by investment  advisers to similar funds for  comparable  services
(when,  if  applicable,  the fees charged to those other funds were  adjusted to
reflect  the effects of the  incentive  compensation  to which  certain of those
funds were subject) and Series expense ratios were  reasonable  given Series net
assets.

      The Directors noted that performance,  while lower than that targeted, had
been  satisfactory,  providing stable absolute returns,  that estimated costs of
the services to be provided and profitability of the Adviser appeared reasonable
and that the Adviser's  affiliation with Citigroup offered  assurances as to its
institutional stability. As to economies of scale, it was noted that the Company
had not yet  grown  sufficiently  to  warrant  evaluation  of  whether  benefits
relating  to its size were being  shared  properly  between  the Adviser and the
Members. The Directors indicated,  however, that they would monitor each Series'
expense  ratio  over time and would look for a reduced  expense  ratio as assets
grow. The Directors also determined the Adviser's  resources and experience were
satisfactory  overall, and that sufficient resources and personnel were assigned
to  the  Adviser's  management  of  the  Company.  Accordingly,  they  concluded
continuing  the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  served  the  interests  of the
Company, each Series and the Members.

      Reductions in the Management Fee to 1.5% of net assets annually as to each
Series (from 2.0% and 2.25% annually as to Series M and Series G,  respectively)
were  approved by the Board of  Directors  on March 11,  2005,  to be  effective
August 1, 2005.  In  approving  these  reductions,  the  Directors  paid special
attention to assurances from the Adviser that the nature,  extent and quality of
services  provided by the  Adviser to the  Company and each Series  would not be
adversely affected.

                                 FUND MANAGEMENT
                                   (UNAUDITED)

      The  Company's  officers are  appointed by the  Directors  and oversee the
management of the day-to-day operations of the Company and each Series under the
supervision  of the  Board of  Directors.  Two of the  Directors  and all of the
officers of the Company are directors, officers or employees of the Adviser, the
Managing Member,  their  subsidiaries or Citigroup.  The other Directors are not
affiliated  with  the  Adviser,  the  Managing  Member,  their  subsidiaries  or
Citigroup and are not "interested  persons" as defined under Section 2(a)(19) of
the 1940 Act (the  "Independent  Directors").  The Directors and officers of the
Company  also  may be  directors  and  officers  of other  investment  companies
managed, advised,  administered or distributed by Citigroup or its subsidiaries.
A list of the  Directors  and  officers of the Company and a brief  statement of
their present positions and principal occupations during the past five years are
set out below.  To the fullest extent allowed by applicable  law,  including the
1940 Act, the Limited Liability Company Agreement  indemnifies the Directors and
officers for all costs,  liabilities  and expenses that they may experience as a
result of their service as such.

      Certain of the  Directors  and officers of the Company are also  directors
and/or officers of other investment companies that are advised by the Adviser or
its affiliates. The address for each Director and officer in his or her capacity
as such is 399 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10043.

as of March 31, 2005

Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC -
Series M ("Multi-Strategy" or the "Portfolio") was up 3.75% annualized since its
inception in January 2003. For the same time period, the S&P 500 was up 15.97%,
while the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index was up 3.53%.

COMMENTARY
- ----------

March was a difficult month for hedge funds, with the exception of fixed-income
arbitrage strategies. All major global equity markets were down while fixed
income markets were mainly unchanged. The macro environment saw rising oil
prices, inflationary worries, and increasing interest rates. Global macro
managers struggled as sharp reversals in many markets made directional trading
difficult. Long/short equity managers were generally down for the month.
Convertible arbitrage strategies continued to underperform amidst falling equity
prices, widening credit spreads, and continued redemptions. Distressed debt
managers were generally down as spreads widened by 79 basis points ("bps") from
285 bps to 364 bps. Fixed income arbitrage strategies performed well as they
benefited from a widening of spreads among credit, emerging markets, swaps and
mortgages.

QUARTERLY OUTLOOK
- -----------------

The first quarter of 2005 was generally difficult for both traditional and
alternative money managers. Volatility remained stubbornly low and most markets
finished at or close to their low points of 2005. Whereas in recent years such
performance has generally been attributed to geopolitical risks, such as
terrorism and the War in Iraq, this past quarter was relatively quiet in terms
of external events. What proved challenging to markets last quarter, however,
were the risks posed to economic growth by the withdrawal of monetary and other
economic stimuli. Central banks across the globe have been steadily increasing
shortterm interest rates and reducing liquidity, and none have been as
aggressive as the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (the "Fed"). Over the past year, the
Fed has raised interest rates seven times, moving the Fed Funds Rate from 1.00%
to 2.75%. Moreover, commodity prices, in particular energy, have continued to
surge. Crude oil, for example, has surged from $43 a barrel to over $55 in the
past three months. As demand for most energy products is relatively inelastic,
this has acted in effect as a consumption tax and a withdrawal of liquidity.

Nevertheless, corporations, consumers and governments alike are doing what they
can to offset the deleterious effects of this withdrawal of liquidity. Consumers
are withdrawing equity from their homes while lowering monthly payments by
assuming interest rate risk. Corporations are actively buying and selling each
other in search of cost savings and synergy. Governments are spending, cutting
taxes and running up large deficits. All of these beneficiaries of the recent
monetary and credit expansion have been successful thus far in staving off the
effects of monetary tightening. This has lead some to believe that the current
deceleration will be transitory in nature and that both stronger growth and
earnings are in the offing in the second half of this year. Somewhat
contradictory is that it is also expected that the monetary contraction under
way will continue and conditions will be even more restrictive. As growth seems
to be a largely monetary phenomenon, it would seem unlikely that it will re-
accelerate as rates rise. In the short term, these conflicting influences have
made markets choppy, directionless and frustrating. In the long term, it makes
them vulnerable to potential dislocations and economic disappointment.

The divergence between short-term and long-term prospects poses challenges for
money managers of all stripes, hedge fund managers being no exception. While no
longer being able to rely on beta as a steady source of returns as market
direction seems unclear, dramatic capital inflows into hedge funds and other
absolute return strategies have made their pursuit of alpha more competitive and
difficult. It has never been

Series M - Letter to Members

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

more important to invest with the right managers and in the right strategies,
which is what the Investment Manager will continue to focus on going forward.

TACTICAL VIEW
- -------------

GLOBAL MACRO: POSITIVE

The macro community remains divided on the likely direction of interest rates
and currencies in the short term. Both markets remain in transition leaving room
for some significant moves and therefore opportunities in the quarters to come.

LONG/SHORT EQUITY: NEUTRAL

Global equity markets generally had a difficult first quarter, as did most
long/short managers. If this continues, long short managers will have to
scramble to generate alpha and not be able to rely on beta as a significant
source of returns.

EQUITY ARBITRAGE: POSITIVE

Volatility picked up in the first quarter, which helped most managers in this
strategy. Equity arbitrage managers should benefit if this trend continues.

CONVERTIBLE ARBITRAGE: NEUTRAL

The pick up in volatility was a welcomed relief for most managers but
unfortunately it was accompanied by a widening of credit spreads. Both of these
developments were relatively modest in scope and largely offsetting. As the tug
of war continues, managers will continue to face a challenging environment.

DISTRESSED: NEUTRAL

Spreads widened and rates increased modestly during the quarter, hurting many
distressed managers. Whether it was just a much needed correction or the
beginning of a reversal remains to be seen. Either way, spreads still remain
tight, and the risks remain negatively skewed.

MERGER ARBITRAGE/MULTI-STRATEGY EVENT: POSITIVE

The corporate transaction market remains active and provides an excellent
backdrop for managers using this strategy.

FIXED INCOME ARBITRAGE: NEUTRAL

Uncertainty about the direction of interest rates remains both an opportunity
and challenge for most fixed income managers, as is the widening of mortgage
spreads for most mortgage managers.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2005

      1.    ORGANIZATION

            Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge   Fund
            Portfolios LLC ("the  Company") was organized as a Delaware  Limited
            Liability  Company on August 16,  2002.  The  Company is  registered
            under  the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act")  as
            amended,  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment
            company.  The Company is also registered under the Securities Act of
            1933 ("1933  Act").  The Company  consists of two  separate  series,
            Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  (each  a
            "Series").   The  financial   statements  included  herein  are  for
            Multi-Strategy  Series M. The investment objective of Multi-Strategy
            Series M is to  achieve  capital  appreciation  principally  through
            investing  in  investment  funds  ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by
            third-party investment managers ("Investment  Managers") that employ
            a variety of alternative  investment  strategies.  These  investment
            strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage
            or   short-side   positions   to   take   advantage   of   perceived
            inefficiencies  across  the global  markets,  often  referred  to as
            "alternative"   strategies.   Because   Investment  Funds  following
            alternative  investment  strategies  are  often  described  as hedge
            funds,  the  investment  program of  Multi-Strategy  Series M can be
            described as a fund of hedge funds.

            Units of  Multi-Strategy  Series M are  sold to  eligible  investors
            (referred  to as  "Members").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in
            Multi-Strategy Series M from each Member is $25,000 (and was $50,000
            from  January 1, 2003 to November 1, 2003);  the minimum  additional
            investment is $10,000.

            Citigroup Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI", or the "Adviser"),  a
            Delaware  limited  liability  company  and  indirect,  wholly  owned
            subsidiary of Citigroup Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
            investment  adviser.  The  Adviser is  registered  as an  investment
            adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and,
            among  other  things,   is   responsible   for  the   allocation  of
            Multi-Strategy Series M's assets to various Investment Funds. AMACAR
            Partners, Inc. is the managing member of Multi-Strategy Series M and
            has delegated  substantially all authority to oversee the management
            of the operations and assets of Multi-Strategy Series M to the Board
            of Directors.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            Investments  in  Investment  Funds are  subject  to the terms of the
            respective limited partnership agreements, limited liability company
            agreements and offering  memoranda.  Multi-Strategy  Series M values
            these  investments at fair value based on financial data supplied by
            the Investment Funds.

            A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The net asset value of  Multi-Strategy  Series M is determined as of
            the close of  business at the end of each month in  accordance  with
            the  valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be  determined
            from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the Board of
            Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2005 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  investments  in  Investment  Funds  are
            carried at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
            pro-rata  interest in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All
            valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
            Fund and are net of management  and  performance  incentive  fees or
            other  allocations  payable to the  Investment  Funds'  managers  as
            required  by  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment
            Manager  to  which  the   Adviser   allocates   assets  will  charge
            Multi-Strategy  Series M, as  investor in an  underlying  Investment
            Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the Investment Managers
            will  receive  performance-based  compensation  in  the  form  of an
            incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of the Investment  Managers are
            generally expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the net assets
            under their  management and the incentive fee is generally  expected
            to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

            As a general  matter,  the fair value of  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
            investment  in  an  Investment   Fund  represents  the  amount  that
            Multi-Strategy  Series M can  reasonably  expect to receive  from an
            Investment  Fund  if  Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  investment  were
            redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available at
            the time.  The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions
            ranging from monthly to annually. Investment Funds generally require
            advance notice of a Member's intent to redeem its interest, and may,
            depending on the Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or
            delay a redemption request.  Multi-Strategy Series M does not take a
            liquidity  discount on any  Investment  Funds held.  The  underlying
            investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value
            as described in each Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.  The
            Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their assets in restricted
            securities and other investments that are illiquid.

            B.    FUND EXPENSES

            Multi-Strategy Series M bears all expenses incurred in the course of
            its operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all
            costs and expenses  related to portfolio  transactions and positions
            for Multi-Strategy  Series M's account;  professional fees; costs of
            insurance;  registration  expenses;  and expenses of meetings of the
            Board of Directors.  Costs  incurred in connection  with the initial
            offering were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of
            operations;  costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy Series
            M's  subsequent  registration  under the 1933 Act have been deferred
            and were  amortized  over the  twelve  months  commencing  after the
            effective date of such registration statement.

            C.    INCOME TAXES

            Multi-Strategy   Series  M   currently   intends  to  operate  as  a
            partnership and not as an association or publicly traded partnership
            taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Each
            Member will be required to report on his,  her or its own annual tax
            return the Member's  distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series M's
            taxable income or loss.

            D.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank,
            N.A.  account which pays money market rates and are accounted for at
            cost plus accrued interest.

            E.    CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

            Contributions   received   in   advance   of   $401,700   represents
            subscriptions  received to be credited to Members'  capital accounts
            on April 1,  2005.  Such  amount is  included  within the short term
            investments  balance as  depicted  on the  accompanying  schedule of
            investments.

            F.    RECEIVABLE FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

            Receivable from investment  funds of $8,392,061  represents  amounts
            due to  Multi-Strategy  Series M for sales of  interests  in certain
            investment funds.

            G.    USE OF ESTIMATES

            The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with U.S.
            generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Adviser to
            make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
            the  financial   statements  and  accompanying  notes.  The  Adviser
            believes  that the  estimates  utilized in preparing  Multi-Strategy
            Series M's financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however,
            actual results could differ from these estimates.

      3.    MANAGEMENT FEE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
            OTHER

            CAI, as Adviser,  provides  certain  management  and  administrative
            services to Multi-Strategy  Series M. CAI acts primarily to evaluate
            and select Investment Managers, to allocate assets, to establish and
            apply risk management procedures,  and to monitor overall investment
            performance.  In addition,  CAI also provides office space and other
            support services. In consideration for such services, Multi-Strategy
            Series M will pay the  Adviser  a  monthly  management  fee equal to
            0.167%  (2.00%  on an  annualized  basis)  of end of month  Members'
            capital.  The  Adviser  will  pay  a  portion  of  the  fee  to  its
            affiliates.

            A reduction  in the  management  fee to 1.5% of net assets  annually
            (from 2.00%  annually for  Multi-Strategy  Series M) was approved by
            the Board of Directors to be effective August 1, 2005.

            In addition,  CAI allocated  certain  marketing  related expenses of
            $22,742 to  Multi-Strategy  Series M during the year ended March 31,
            2005.

            Placement  agents may be  retained  by the  Company to assist in the
            placement of Units. A placement  agent  affiliated with the Adviser,
            will  generally  be entitled to receive a fee from each  investor in
            the Company whose Units the Agent places. The specific amount of the
            placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent
            on the size of the investment in a Series. Placement agents may also
            be reimbursed  by the Company with respect to certain  out-of-pocket
            expenses.

            Citigroup Global Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
            wholly owned  subsidiary  of Citigroup,  Inc.  serves as a placement
            agent of the Multi-Strategy Series M Units. For the year ended March
            31, 2005, CGM earned  $292,000 in placement  fees on  Multi-Strategy
            Series M Units.  Such fees are  deducted  from an  investor's  gross
            contribution amount.

            The Company has entered into agreements with third parties to act as
            additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M Units.
            Placement  fees may range from 0 to 3%. In  addition,  the  Adviser,
            and/or its affiliates,  will pay the placement agents an annual fee,
            payable monthly in arrears. The fee shall be paid from the Adviser's
            own resources (or those of its affiliates).

            Multi-Strategy  Series M pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on
            an annualized basis) for administration based primarily upon average
            net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,  and will  reimburse
            certain  expenses.  CAI, as  Administrator,  has retained  PFPC Inc.
            ("PFPC"), an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of
            The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
            its administrative duties. PFPC provides certain accounting,  record
            keeping, tax and investor related services.

            Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of the Company,  as
            defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
            a fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $500.  Such  Director
            fees are  allocated to each series  pro-rata,  based on the relative
            net  assets  of each  series.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested
            person"  does not receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.
            All  Directors  are  reimbursed  for all  reasonable  out of  pocket
            expenses.   Total   amounts   expensed   related  to   Directors  by
            Multi-Strategy  Series M for the year  ended  March  31,  2005  were
            $10,510.

            PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as custodian of
            Multi-Strategy Series M's assets and provides custodial services for
            Multi-Strategy   Series  M.  Fees  payable  to  the   custodian  and
            reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series
            M.

      5.    CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

            Generally,  initial and  additional  subscriptions  for Units may be
            accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized
            by the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  to accept or reject any
            initial and  additional  subscriptions  for Units in  Multi-Strategy
            Series  M.  The  Board  of  Directors  from  time to time and in its
            complete   and   exclusive   discretion   may   determine  to  cause
            Multi-Strategy Series M to repurchase Units from Members pursuant to
            written  tenders by Members on such terms and  conditions  as it may
            determine. CAI expects that it typically will recommend to the Board
            of Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Units from Members
            quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31
            (or,  if any such date is not a  business  day,  on the  immediately
            preceding business day).

            Net  profits  or net  losses  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M for each
            month-end will be allocated among and credited to or debited against
            the capital accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month
            in accordance with the Members'  respective  investment  percentages
            for the month.

      6.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S ADVISORY AGREEMENT BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
(UNAUDITED)

      The  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  between the  Company  and  Citigroup
Alternative Investments LLC as investment adviser to each of Series M and Series
G was approved by the initial  Member of each Series on November 27, 2002 and by
the Board of Directors most recently on September 10, 2004 (with  Management Fee
reductions applicable to each Series subsequently approved on March 11, 2005, as
described  below).  The Board of  Directors  anticipates  next  considering  the
Investment Advisory Agreement before November 2005.

      In approving the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement in September  2004,  the
Board of Directors  considered  the  Company's  existing  relationship  with the
Adviser and its affiliates,  as well as the ongoing commitment of the Adviser to
the Company. The Directors also considered Series investment performance to date
and  the  resources  and  experience  of the  Adviser,  its  affiliates  and the
individuals  dedicated to the Company's  investment program. In this regard, the
Directors  reviewed  materials  relevant to the  investment  performance  of the
Company and the Adviser, as well as various materials describing the Adviser and
its personnel.  They evaluated these factors in light of the nature,  extent and
quality  of  the  services  provided  by the  Adviser,  the  total  compensation
received,  directly or indirectly,  by the Adviser from the Company (no indirect
compensation,  such  as  through  soft  dollar  arrangements  or  other  service
benefits,  was  identified)  and the  total  cost to the  Company  of using  the
Adviser's  services,  taking into account both expenses borne by the Adviser and
those  that may be passed to the  Company  by the  Adviser.  In  addition,  they
compared competitive prices for comparable  services,  reviewing fee information
for a variety of  investment  funds  similar in structure to the Company.  Among
other things,  the Directors  determined the Adviser's fees were  competitive to
those charged by investment  advisers to similar funds for  comparable  services
(when,  if  applicable,  the fees charged to those other funds were  adjusted to
reflect  the effects of the  incentive  compensation  to which  certain of those
funds were subject) and Series expense ratios were  reasonable  given Series net
assets.

      The Directors noted that performance,  while lower than that targeted, had
been  satisfactory,  providing stable absolute returns,  that estimated costs of
the services to be provided and profitability of the Adviser appeared reasonable
and that the Adviser's  affiliation with Citigroup offered  assurances as to its
institutional stability. As to economies of scale, it was noted that the Company
had not yet  grown  sufficiently  to  warrant  evaluation  of  whether  benefits
relating  to its size were being  shared  properly  between  the Adviser and the
Members. The Directors indicated,  however, that they would monitor each Series'
expense  ratio  over time and would look for a reduced  expense  ratio as assets
grow. The Directors also determined the Adviser's  resources and experience were
satisfactory  overall, and that sufficient resources and personnel were assigned
to  the  Adviser's  management  of  the  Company.  Accordingly,  they  concluded
continuing  the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  served  the  interests  of the
Company, each Series and the Members.

      Reductions in the Management Fee to 1.5% of net assets annually as to each
Series (from 2.0% and 2.25% annually as to Series M and Series G,  respectively)
were  approved by the Board of  Directors  on March 11,  2005,  to be  effective
August 1, 2005.  In  approving  these  reductions,  the  Directors  paid special
attention to assurances from the Adviser that the nature,  extent and quality of
services  provided by the  Adviser to the  Company and each Series  would not be
adversely affected.

                                   (UNAUDITED)

      The  Company's  officers are  appointed by the  Directors  and oversee the
management of the day-to-day operations of the Company and each Series under the
supervision  of the  Board of  Directors.  Two of the  Directors  and all of the
officers of the Company are directors, officers or employees of the Adviser, the
Managing Member,  their  subsidiaries or Citigroup.  The other Directors are not
affiliated  with  the  Adviser,  the  Managing  Member,  their  subsidiaries  or

the 1940 Act (the  "Independent  Directors").  The Directors and officers of the
Company  also  may be  directors  and  officers  of other  investment  companies
managed, advised,  administered or distributed by Citigroup or its subsidiaries.
A list of the  Directors  and  officers of the Company and a brief  statement of
their present positions and principal occupations during the past five years are
set out below.  To the fullest extent allowed by applicable  law,  including the
1940 Act, the Limited Liability Company Agreement  indemnifies the Directors and
officers for all costs,  liabilities  and expenses that they may experience as a
result of their service as such.

      Certain of the  Directors  and officers of the Company are also  directors
and/or officers of other investment companies that are advised by the Adviser or
its affiliates. The address for each Director and officer in his or her capacity
as such is 399 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10043.

       ===================================================================
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT
       ===================================================================


         Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC (the "Adviser" or "CAI") and
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (the
"Company") are each committed to the highest standards of professional
excellence and ethics. The interests of the Company's members and other advisory
clients of CAI are paramount and must be placed at all times ahead of the
personal interests of Company/CAI personnel. It is critical that there be no
actual or potential conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict.
In addition, Company/CAI personnel should not take advantage of their position
in the firm to obtain a benefit that would not be generally available. The
actual or apparent conflict of interest from such actions would be extremely
harmful to the reputation of the Company and of CAI and to investor
relationships.
         This Code of Conduct (the "Company Code") is intended to be a general
guideline and cannot address every specific situation which may arise. Specific
situations should be discussed with the Compliance Officer. In addition to the
Company Code, Company/CAI personnel should familiarize themselves with the
CITIGROUP GLOBAL INVESTMENTS Personal Securities Trading Policy (the "CGI
Policy") attached hereto as Appendix A, which is applicable to all Company
employees.

     A.   PRE-CLEARANCE

          1.   No Access Person shall purchase or sell a Security for a personal
               account without obtaining approval in advance. Such approval
               shall be obtained in advance in the manner set forth in the CGI
               Policy. Approval for the purchase or sale of a Security is only
               valid for the day on which it is given. Notwithstanding this
               general pre-clearance requirement, Access Persons are not
               required to obtain pre-clearance for transactions in dividend
               reinvestment programs, company sponsored stock purchase programs,
               rights offerings, and involuntary situations (such as mergers).

          2.   An Independent Director will not be subject to the pre-clearance
               provisions of this Code unless the Independent Director knows, or
               in the course of fulfilling his or her official duties as an
               Independent Director should know, that, within the most recent
               fifteen (15) days, the Company has purchased or sold, or
               considered for purchase or sale, the Security under consideration
               for purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the Independent
               Director.

     B.   PRIVATE PLACEMENTS

     No Investment Person (or other natural person in a control relationship to
the Company or the Adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations
made to the Company with regard to the purchase or sale of a Security by or on
behalf of the Company) shall acquire Securities in a private placement
transaction unless prior approval is obtained in the manner set

<PAGE>

forth in the CGI Policy (the individual's business head should also be consulted
as part of the prior approval process). If a Security is acquired in a private
placement transaction, the Investment Person (or other such control person, if
applicable) must disclose such ownership in any future discussions or decision
making process concerning the issuer of such Security and any subsequent
decision to acquire a Security issued by such issuer can only be made with the
concurrence of a Company Portfolio Manager other than such Investment Person (or
such other control person, if applicable).

     C.   INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS

     The acquisition of Securities in an initial public offering by any person
subject to this Code is discouraged, but may be made if prior approval is
obtained in the manner set forth in the CGI Policy. In addition, the acquisition
of equity Securities in an initial public offering is prohibited under the CGI
Policy. Independent Directors are not subject to these pre-clearance provisions
with respect to their investments in Securities in an initial public offering
unless the Independent Director knows, or in the course of fulfilling his or her
official duties as an Independent Director should know, that, within the most
recent fifteen (15) days, the Company has purchased or sold, or considered for
purchase or sale, the Security under consideration for purchase or sale,
directly or indirectly, by the Independent Director.

     D.   BLACKOUT PERIODS

          1.    No Access Person may buy or sell a Security if the Adviser is
buying or selling such Security (or a related Security) for or on behalf of an
Account for one business day before or after the Account's transactions are
executed or withdrawn. No Portfolio Manager may purchase or sell a security
within seven (7) calendar days before or after a day on which an Account which
he or she manages has traded in such Security (or a related Security). Any
profits realized on such a trade must be disgorged. Notwithstanding this general
blackout

<PAGE>

requirement, transactions exempt from pre-clearance under item II.A.(2) also are
exempt from this blackout requirement.

          2.    An Independent Director will not be subject to the blackout
period provisions of this Code unless the Independent Director knows, or in the
course of fulfilling his or her official duties as an Independent Director
should know, that, within the most recent fifteen (15) days, the Company has
purchased or sold, or considered for purchase or sale, the Security under
consideration for purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the Independent
Director.

     E.   BAN ON CERTAIN TRADING

          1.    No Access Person shall purchase or sell, directly or indirectly,
any Security which he or she knows, or should have known, at the time of such
purchase or sale is being considered for purchase or sale by an Account or is
being purchased or sold by an Account.

          2.    No Access Person shall cause an Account to take action, or to
fail to take action, for the purpose of achieving a personal benefit. Examples
of this conduct include causing an Account to purchase a Security owned by the
Access Person for the purpose of supporting or driving up the price of the
Security, and causing an Account to refrain from selling a Security in an
attempt to protect the value of the Access Person's investment.

          3.    No Access Person shall use knowledge of a transaction for an
Account to profit by the market effect of such transaction.

          4.    Investment Persons shall not engage in the trading of Securities
on a short-term basis. No Investment Person shall be allowed to profit from the
purchase and sale or the sale and purchase of the same or equivalent Securities
within a sixty (60) calendar day period. Any profit realized on such a
short-term trade must be disgorged. If unforeseen circumstances require the sale
of a Security within such sixty (60) calendar day period,

<PAGE>

exceptions to the prohibition on sale may be requested from the Company's
Compliance Officer or his or her designate.

          5.    The sale of a call on an individual stock that you do not own
(i.e., a short call) is prohibited, as is the sale of a narrow-based stock index
option. Subject to the sixty (60) day holding period, the purchase of such a put
or call option (i.e., a long put or call) is permitted, as is the sale of a call
or the purchase of a put on an individual stock to hedge a long stock position
(i.e., a covered call or put). Special rules under the CGI Policy apply to
options on the stock of Citigroup and its affiliates. This restriction does not
apply to an Independent Director.

          6.    No Access Person may purchase or sell a Security if the Access
Person has any material nonpublic information regarding the issuer or an
affiliated issuer.

     F.   LOCATION OF TRADING ACCOUNTS (AND TRANSACTION REPORTING)

          1.    Access Persons (other than Independent Directors) generally are
encouraged to maintain their Securities trading accounts at subsidiaries of
Citigroup. However, an Access Person may maintain a trading account elsewhere if
the Access Person gives prior written notice to the Compliance Officer or
designate and the third party specifically agrees to provide the Compliance
Officer with copies of trade confirmations at the same time as they are sent to
the employee. In any event, it is the responsibility of each Access Person
(other than an Independent Director) to instruct their brokers (subsidiaries of
Citigroup or otherwise) to provide the Compliance Officer or designate with
copies of trade confirmations (or, to the extent permitted by the CGI Policy, to
report such person's Securities' transactions to the Compliance Officer or
designate directly on at least a quarterly basis not later than ten days after
the end of the particular calendar quarter).

          2.    An Independent Director will be subject to the reporting
provisions of this Code only with respect to transactions by the Independent
Director, directly or indirectly, in

<PAGE>

Securities as to which the Independent Director knows, or in the course of
fulfilling his or her official duties as an Independent Director should know,
that, within the 15-day period before or after the Independent Director's
transaction in such Security, the Company has purchased or sold, or considered
for purchase or sale, such Security. Any such transaction report may include a
statement disclaiming the report as an admission of direct or indirect
"beneficial ownership". In addition, no report is required if effected for an
account over which the Independent Director has no direct or indirect influence
or control, or which is managed on a discretionary basis by a person other than
an the Independent Director and as to which the Independent Director does not in
fact exercise influence or control.

     G.   APPLICABLE ACCOUNTS

     The restrictions in II(A)-(F) above apply to accounts in which an Access
Person, Investment Person, Portfolio Manager and members of their immediate
family have an ownership interest and/or over which they have control.

III. REPORTING

     Upon employment, each Access Person (other than an Independent Director)
shall provide a listing of all Securities held by or for such person, as well as
the name of any broker or bank with whom the Access Person has an account
holding Securities held by or for such person (as is further described in the
CGI Policy).

IV.  GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

     Access Persons and close family members are not permitted to accept gifts,
loans or preferential treatment from any person doing business with or on behalf
of the Company or its Adviser. This prohibition does not include occasional
business meals which can be reciprocated or gifts of purely nominal value.

<PAGE>

V.   SERVICE ON BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

     No Access Person (other than an Independent Director) shall serve on the
board of directors of a publicly traded company without compliance with all
applicable Company or CGI policies and the obtaining of all required approvals.

VI.  ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

     Each Access Person must certify in writing on an annual basis that he or
she has received the Company Code, understands its provisions and agrees to be
bound by its terms. Each Access Person must certify annually that he or she has
complied with the requirements of this Code and has disclosed or reported all
personal securities transactions required to be disclosed or reported pursuant
to its requirements.

VII. SANCTIONS

     Violations of this Code will be scrutinized carefully by the Company. The
penalty for violation can include dismissal from the Company and its affiliates.

<PAGE>

                                                                      Appendix A



                          CITIGROUP GLOBAL INVESTMENTS

                       PERSONAL SECURITIES TRADING POLICY

                                  JUNE 5, 2002

This Personal Securities Trading Policy (the "Policy" or "Policies") applies to
all U.S. based full and part time personnel of Citigroup Global Investments
("CGI"), including Citigroup Alternative Investments ("CAI"), ("Covered
Persons"). While similar policies apply to employees located overseas, such
local policies may be more or less stringent depending on local requirements and
circumstances. TAMIC and CAI Codes of Ethics that are more restrictive will also
apply to TAMIC "access persons" and all CAI personnel.

The purpose of these Policies is to ensure that securities trading activities by
Covered Persons do not intentionally or inadvertently violate applicable laws
and regulations, do not give even the appearance of inappropriate activity or a
conflict of interest, and do not interfere with investment activities for
corporate or fiduciary portfolios. While these policies are designed to address
both identified and potential conflicts, they cannot possibly be written broadly
enough to cover all potential situations. Covered Persons accordingly are
expected to adhere not only to the letter, but also the spirit, of these
policies.

VIOLATIONS OF THESE POLICIES CAN NOT ONLY CAUSE EMBARRASSMENT, LOSS OF BUSINESS,
FINES AND OTHER LEGAL RESTRICTIONS FOR THE COVERED COMPANIES BUT ALSO CAN LEAD
TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR THE PERSONS INVOLVED. UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A
VIOLATION, THE OFFENDING EMPLOYEE WILL RECEIVE A WRITTEN WARNING. THE EMPLOYEE'S
SUPERVISOR WILL RECEIVE A COPY OF THE WARNING. COMPLIANCE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH
BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO ASSESS ADDITIONAL PENALTIES,
WHICH WOULD INCREASE WITH THE SEVERITY AND/OR FREQUENCY OF THE OFFENSE. THE
ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL PENALTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE PLACEMENT OF
A WRITTEN REPRIMAND IN THE EMPLOYEE'S PERSONNEL FILE, THE IMPOSITION OF A FINE,
THE SUSPENSION OF THE RIGHT TO TRADE OR THE SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF
EMPLOYMENT.

These Policies are in addition to other applicable Citigroup policies, including
policies regarding the treatment of material, non-public information. Covered
Persons must never trade in a security or commodity while in possession of
material, non-public information about the issuer or the market for those
securities or commodities, even if the such person has satisfied all other
requirements of these policies.

Information concerning your personal securities transactions will be kept
confidential and used ONLY for purposes of administering the Policy and assuring
compliance with its requirements. As noted above, supervisors and other
appropriate business managers will be informed of violations of these policies.

<PAGE>

If you have any questions regarding the application of the Policy, please
contact your designated compliance officer (the "Compliance Officer") who,
together with the General Counsel, will be responsible for its implementation.

SECURITIES TRADING POLICY
- -------------------------

VIII. COVERAGE

     A.   COVERED ACCOUNTS

          In the absence of an exception, this Policy applies to transactions in
          securities (as defined below) and related financial instruments in
          "covered accounts." A covered account is any account in which a
          Covered Person has a financial interest or has the power, directly or
          indirectly, to make or influence investment decisions. Included within
          the definition are accounts of (i) a Covered Person's spouse or
          domestic partner; (ii) a Covered Person's minor children and any other
          related individuals who reside in the same house with or are
          financially dependent upon the Covered Person; (iii) any other
          individual to whose financial support the Covered Person materially
          contributes; and (iv) any account for which a Covered Person is the
          trustee or fiduciary or has power of attorney.

          A.   EXCLUDED ACCOUNTS

          These policies do not apply to (i) fully discretionary or managed
          accounts with professional money management organizations where the
          Covered Person receives portfolio transaction information not more
          often than monthly*; (ii) estate or trust accounts in which a Covered
          Person has a beneficial interest but no power to affect or ability to
          influence investment decisions, (iii) accounts at mutual funds that
          hold only shares of open-end funds purchased directly from that fund
          company provided that the account does not by its terms allow for the
          execution of securities or commodities transactions; (iv) 401(k),
          403(b) and Keogh accounts where the Covered Person has no power to
          invest in individual


- ----------------------------------
*         Fully discretionary brokerage accounts generally do not qualify for
          this exemption because confirmations are delivered promptly after the
          execution of each transaction. Provided that there is no communication
          between the broker and the covered person regarding investment
          decisions prior to execution, however, these accounts will not be
          subject to preclearance or to the 60 day holding period. Compliance
          with the other rules in Sections IV through ` including the provision
          of duplicate trade confirmations and account statements, is still
          required.

<PAGE>

          securities**; (v) CDs, money market, savings or checking accounts at
          banks provided that the account does not by its terms allow for the
          execution of securities or commodities transactions; and (v) direct
          investment programs which allow the purchase of securities directly
          from the issuer without the intermediation of a broker-dealer provided
          that the timing and size of the purchases are established by a
          pre-arranged schedule.

     B.   SECURITIES AND RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

          For purposes of this policy, the term "securities" includes stocks,
          notes, bonds, closed-end mutual funds, options, warrants and other
          derivative securities regardless of whether they are private or
          publicly traded. However, certain financial instruments that do not
          present compliance issues are not considered to be "securities" for
          these purposes and are exceptions to this policy. These excluded
          instruments are U.S. government and agency securities, municipal
          securities, short-term money market instruments, certificates of
          deposit, commodities and open-end mutual funds. Futures, options on
          futures and options on broad-based stock indices are also excluded, as
          are trust securities that replicate broad-based stock indices.

IX.  BASIC RULES

          B.   No transaction may be completed for a Covered Account if the
               employee has any material nonpublic information regarding the
               issuer or an affiliated issuer. Please refer to CGI's Policy on
               Confidential Information and Chinese Walls for further
               information about material nonpublic information and your
               obligations in such a situation.

          C.   No transaction may be completed for a Covered Account in any
               security that is included on a restricted list to which that
               Covered Account is subject. In addition, no transaction in any
               security may be completed for a Covered Account that (i) will
               violate any applicable laws or regulations,


- ------------------------------
**   The Citigroup 401 (k) plan is not a covered account.

<PAGE>

               (ii) could give the appearance of inappropriate activity or a
               conflict of interest, or (iii) could disadvantage or interfere
               with investing or securities trading activities by firm or
               customer accounts.

     A.   COVERED PERSONS WHOSE JOB FUNCTIONS RELATE TO PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ARE
          PROHIBITED FROM SELLING SHORT FOR COVERED ACCOUNTS ANY SECURITY OR
          RELATED CONVERTIBLE SECURITY OWNED BY THE PORTFOLIOS FOR WHICH THEY
          ARE RESPONSIBLE. SIMILARLY, BUYING FOR COVERED ACCOUNTS ANY SECURITY
          OR RELATED CONVERTIBLE SECURITY SOLD SHORT BY THOSE PORTFOLIOS IS
          PROHIBITED. COVERED PERSONS ARE ALSO PROHIBITED FROM USING DERIVATIVES
          TO EFFECT ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TRANSACTIONS.

     B.   TRANSACTIONS FOR COVERED ACCOUNTS IN ANY SECURITY AT ANY TIME THAT
          TRANSACTIONS OF ANY SORT IN THE SECURITY OR RELATED CONVERTIBLE
          SECURITY ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR ANY OF THE PORTFOLIOS TO WHICH
          THE COVERED PERSON'S JOB FUNCTION RELATES ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
          CERTAIN BLACK-OUT PERIODS DURING WHICH TRADES IN SUCH SECURITIES ARE
          PROHIBITED APPLY TO COVERED PERSONS WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE THE
          MANAGEMENT OF SECURITIES INVESTMENTS FOR THIRD PARTIES (I.E., CAI AND
          TAMIC PERSONNEL). THOSE BLACK-OUT PERIODS ARE SET FORTH IN SECTION
          IV.A. OF THIS POLICY.

          D.   No short-term transaction in any security may be completed for a
               Covered Account. Securities may only be purchased for investment
               purposes, and speculative or excessive trading is discouraged.

     C.   COVERED PERSONS MAY NOT EFFECT THE PURCHASE AND SALE, OR SHORT SALE
          AND COVER, OF THE SAME OR EQUIVALENT SECURITIES WITHIN 60 CALENDAR
          DAYS. SECURITIES MAY BE SOLD, OR A SHORT POSITION COVERED, ON THE 61ST
          DAY AFTER THE POSITION WAS ESTABLISHED. A HEDGE IS THE ONLY OFFSETTING
          TRANSACTION THAT MAY BE EFFECTED WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL
          TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED.

     D.   A SHORTER HOLDING PERIOD MAY BE ALLOWED IN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO
          AVOID PERSONAL HARDSHIP WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL OF THE
          COMPLIANCE OFFICER. AN EXCEPTION MAY BE GRANTED WHEN THE VALUE OF A
          COVERED PERSON'S INVESTMENT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED FROM THE
          ORIGINAL ACQUISITION PRICE. HOWEVER, THIS EXCEPTION WILL NOT BE
          GRANTED REPEATEDLY TO PERMIT WHAT AMOUNTS TO SPECULATIVE SHORT-TERM
          TRADING.

     E.   CITIGROUP SECURITIES RECEIVED AS PART OF A COVERED PERSON'S
          COMPENSATION PACKAGE ARE EXEMPT FROM THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD. THESE
          INCLUDE CAP SHARES THAT HAVE VESTED AND SHARES RECEIVED UPON THE
          EXERCISE OF OPTIONS WHOSE RESALE RESTRICTIONS HAVE EXPIRED. EXERCISES
          AND RELOADS OF CITIGROUP STOCK OPTIONS ARE ALSO EXEMPT FROM THE 60-DAY
          HOLDING PERIOD.

<PAGE>

          E.   Subject to the limitations set forth below, Covered Persons may
               buy or sell derivative instruments such as individual stock
               options, options and futures on stock indexes and options and
               futures on fixed income securities. Except as otherwise provided
               herein, these transactions must comply with the preclearance,
               60-day holding period and other restrictions of the Policy.

     F.   SUBJECT TO THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD, COVERED PERSONS MAY HEDGE A LONG
          STOCK POSITION BY SELLING CALLS OR PURCHASING PUTS ON THAT STOCK OR
          MAY HEDGE A SHORT STOCK POSITION BY PURCHASING CALLS ON THAT STOCK.
          HOWEVER, THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD DOES NOT APPLY TO INDIVIDUAL STOCK
          OPTIONS THAT ARE PART OF A HEDGED POSITION WHERE THE UNDERLYING STOCK
          HAS BEEN HELD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS AND THE ENTIRE POSITION (INCLUDING
          THE UNDERLYING SECURITY) IS CLOSED OUT.

     G.   COVERED PERSONS MAY BUY A CALL OPTION, BUY A PUT OPTION OR SELL A PUT
          OPTION ON A STOCK SUCH PERSONS DO NOT OWN, BUT MAY NOT SELL A CALL
          OPTION WITHOUT OWNING THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION,
          COVERED PERSONS MAY NOT EFFECT A SHORT SALE OF A NARROW-BASED STOCK
          INDEX OPTION. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO OPTIONS ON COMMON STOCK OTHER
          THAN CITIGROUP, WHICH IS GOVERNED BY SPECIAL RULES.

          F.   The Compliance Officer may grant discretionary exceptions on a
               case-by-case basis to the general pre-clearance rule, the 60-day
               holding period or to other elements of this Policy if appropriate
               under the circumstances. Requests for and approvals of exceptions
               must be in writing. An approval must be received before it may be
               acted on.

X.   PRECLEARANCE RULE

     A.   GENERAL RULE

     A.   ABSENT AN EXCEPTION, EACH TRANSACTION IN ANY SECURITY MUST RECEIVE
          PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND BE COMPLETED ON
          THE SAME DAY THAT APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED.

     B.   IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A PRECLEARANCE, THE COVERED PERSON MUST FILL OUT
          THE TRADING CLEARANCE FORM, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT A
          AND SUBMIT

<PAGE>

          IT TO THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER, WHO WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS
          PROMPTLY AS PRACTICABLE (USUALLY WITHIN ONE HOUR).

     C.   THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE COVERED PERSON MUST INCLUDE ANY
          POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS TOGETHER WITH WRITTEN CERTIFICATION
          THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM
          AND CUSTOMERS TO TRANSACT IN THE SECURITY.

     B.   EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRECLEARANCE RULE

          There are several automatic exceptions to the general preclearance
          rule for which a separate written exception from the Compliance
          Officer is not necessary. However, compliance with the other rules in
          Sections IV through VI below is still required. These automatic
          exceptions cover the following transactions:

     A.   TRANSACTIONS IN CLOSED-END MUTUAL FUNDS.

     B.   TRANSACTIONS IN COMPANY-SPONSORED STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS, RIGHTS
          OFFERINGS AND INVOLUNTARY SITUATIONS (SUCH AS TENDERING INTO A
          MERGER).

     C.   MUNICIPAL SECURITIES. (NOTE: CAI and TAMIC personnel are required to
          preclear transactions in municipal securities to comply with their
          Codes of Ethics.)

     D.   ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE TERM "SECURITIES" IN
          SECTION 1C ABOVE.

XI.  OTHER RULES

     A.   BLACK-OUT PERIODS

          Certain black-out periods apply to Covered Persons whose business
          units manage securities investments for third parties (i.e., CAI and
          TAMIC personnel). For one business day before or after a day on which
          a third party account managed by a Covered Person's unit buys or sells
          a security, no Covered Person employed by that unit may buy or sell
          the security (or a related security). For seven (7) calendar days
          before or after a day on which a third party account buys or sells a
          security, no Covered Person who is a portfolio manager for the account
          may purchase or sell the security (or a related security). Any profits
          realized on such a trade must be disgorged. Municipal securities are
          covered by this blackout requirement. Notwithstanding this general
          blackout requirement, transactions exempt from preclearance under this
          Policy also are exempt from this blackout requirement.

<PAGE>

     B.   INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS

     A.   COVERED EMPLOYEES MAY NOT PURCHASE EQUITY SECURITIES IN AN INITIAL
          PUBLIC OFFERING.

     C.   PRIVATE EQUITY/ LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS/ HEDGE FUNDS

     A.   INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY (BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH
          FUNDS), LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND HEDGE FUNDS BY COVERED PERSONS OF CGI
          REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM BOTH THE COVERED PERSONS' BUSINESS HEAD AND CGI
          COMPLIANCE.

XII. REPORTING PROCESS

     A.   COVERED PERSONS MUST CERTIFY IN WRITING THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED A COPY
          OF THIS POLICY AND HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ITS PROVISIONS. THE FORM
          OF CERTIFICATION, WHICH YOU ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND RETURN, IS
          ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT B.

     B.   COVERED PERSONS ARE GENERALLY ENCOURAGED TO MAINTAIN THEIR SECURITIES
          TRADING ACCOUNTS AT SUBSIDIARIES OF CITIGROUP. COVERED PERSONS MAY,
          HOWEVER, MAINTAIN COVERED ACCOUNTS ELSEWHERE. NEW EMPLOYEES MUST
          WITHIN 10 DAYS OF REPORTING FOR DUTY COMPLETE THE FORM ATTACHED AS
          EXHIBIT C TO REPORT ALL COVERED ACCOUNTS, AND FIRMS AT WHICH SUCH
          ACCOUNTS ARE HELD MUST SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO PROVIDE THE COMPLIANCE
          OFFICER WITH COPIES OF TRADE CONFIRMATIONS AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY
          ARE SENT TO THE COVERED PERSON.

     C.   COVERED PERSONS MUST GIVE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER
          PRIOR TO OPENING A COVERED ACCOUNT. SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD BE
          PROVIDED ON THE FORM ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT C. THE FIRM AT WHICH THE
          ACCOUNT IS OPENED MUST SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO PROVIDE THE COMPLIANCE
          OFFICER WITH COPIES OF TRADE CONFIRMATIONS AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY
          ARE SENT TO THE COVERED PERSON.

     D.   COVERED PERSONS MUST DISCLOSE IMMEDIATELY TO THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER
          ANY SITUATION THAT THE COVERED PERSON BELIEVES APPEARS TO INVOLVE A
          VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY OR OF APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, OR
          OF ANY INQUIRY FROM ANY SELFREGULATORY, REGULATORY OR GOVERNMENTAL
          AGENCY.

     E.   ANNUALLY, EACH COVERED PERSON WILL BE ASKED TO ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF
          THE POLICY AND ANY MODIFICATIONS, AND TO CERTIFY HIS OR HER COMPLIANCE
          WITH THE POLICY. THE FORM OF CERTIFICATION IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT D.

XIII. TRANSACTIONS IN CITIGROUP SECURITIES

          Unless a Covered Person is a member of a designated group subject to
          more restrictive provisions, or is otherwise notified to the contrary,
          the Covered Person may trade in Citigroup securities without
          restriction (other than the pre-clearance and

<PAGE>

          other requirements of this policy), subject to the limitations set
          forth below.

     G.   Covered Employees may not engage in any transactions in Citigroup
          securities during the "blackout periods" beginning on the first day of
          a calendar quarter and ending 24 hours following release of
          Citigroup's earnings for the prior quarter. Citigroup stock option
          exercises, including cash purchase, swap and reload exercises, are
          permitted during a blackout period, but exercises which involve the
          simultaneous sale of the underlying Citigroup common stock (i.e.,
          same-day-sale or sell-to-cover exercises) are prohibited. With regard
          to exchange-traded options, no transactions in Citigroup options are
          permitted except to close or roll an option position that expires
          during a blackout period. Charitable contributions of Citigroup
          securities may be made during the blackout period, but a private
          foundation controlled by a Covered Employee may not sell donated
          Citigroup common stock during the blackout period.


     H.   No Covered Person may engage at any time in any personal transaction
          in Citigroup securities while in possession of material non-public
          information relating to Citigroup or its securities. Investments in
          Citigroup securities must be made with a long-term orientation rather
          than for speculation or for the generation of short-term trading
          profits, and must be held for at least 60 days. In addition, please
          note that Covered Persons may not engage in any of the following
          transactions in Citigroup securities:

A.   SHORT SALES, OTHER THAN SHORTS AGAINST THE BOX;

<PAGE>

B.   SALES OF PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, OTHER THAN SELLING A CALL TO HEDGE A LONG
     POSITION IN DELIVERABLE CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK;

C.   PURCHASES OF PUTS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES (PUTS MAY BE PURCHASED TO HEDGE
     A LONG POSITION IN DELIVERABLE CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK);

D.   SPECULATIVE OPTION STRATEGIES (I.E., STRADDLES, COMBINATIONS, SPREADS);

E.   ANY TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE HEDGING OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK
     AWARDED UNDER THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM ("CAP").

     I.   The number of Citigroup shares that a Covered Person is entitled to in
          the Citigroup Stock Purchase Plan is not treated as a long stock
          position until such time as the Covered Person has given instructions
          to purchase the shares of Citigroup. Thus, Covered Persons are not
          permitted to use options to hedge their financial interest in the
          Citigroup Stock Purchase Plan.

     J.   Contributions into and transfers within the firm's 401(k) Plan are not
          subject to the restrictions and prohibitions (including preclearance)
          set forth in this policy.
