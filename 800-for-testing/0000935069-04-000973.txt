that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic  changes and market  risks.  This may result in greater share price
volatility.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   June 14, 2004

Dear Shareholders,

   For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the Central Europe and Russia Fund's
total return based on net asset value rose 16.7%.  This compares with the Fund's
benchmark  return of 15.8% in US dollar term. The region continues to outperform
developed  markets as the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index rose 5.39% and the
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Europe Index rose 11.1%.

   The Fund's  out-performance was due to both country and stock selection.  The
Fund's exposure in Central Europe contributed to investment returns. The Central
European  equity  markets  performed  particularly  well  in the  run-up  to the
European Union ("EU")  accession,  which was completed  successfully on May 1st,
2004,  with ten  countries,  including  three of the Fund's core markets  (Czech
Republic,  Hungary,  and Poland) joining the EU. The Czech Republic was the best
performing country in the Fund's portfolio, gaining more than 30% during the six
month reporting period.  Our overweight  position in Ceske  Radiokomunikace,  as
well as our  underweight  position in the  underperforming  Cesky Telecom shares
added value during the first six months of the fiscal year. The Hungarian market
also  outperformed  the region,  rising  nearly 24% in USD terms.  The strongest
performance came from the Fund's holding in OTP Bank.  Hungarian  pharmaceutical
companies  fell  victim  to  government  actions,  imposing  price  cuts  on the
regulated  pharmaceuticals.  However, a negative impact on your Fund performance
was avoided by selling  the  position  in Gedeon  Richter in due time.  Poland's
equity market slightly  underperformed the region by rising slightly over 13% in
US dollar terms.

   Late April risk  aversion  increased  due to investor  concerns over the much
anticipated  rise  in  interest  rates  in the US and the  Chinese  government's
efforts to slow its economy.  As a result more volatile markets,  such as Russia
and Turkey,  faced greater  selling  pressure than the Central  European  equity
markets,  giving up some of their previous gains. In Russia,  the Fund benefited
from its  exposure  to Lukoil and  Transneft,  the oil  pipeline  operator.  The
Turkish stock market has seen a steep price decline of nearly 20% in April. As a
consequence the Fund's Turkish  holdings  declined in value,  however,  the Fund
benefited from its underweight position versus its benchmark.

   On March  30,  2004,  The  Central  Europe  and  Russia  Fund  announced  the
successful  completion  of its rights  offering to holders of the Fund's  common
stock with 2,555,677 new shares issued. The offering, which expired on March 19,
2004, was  over-subscribed  and new shares were issued at the subscription price
of  $20.82.  The  proceeds  of the  offering  were used to  increase  the Fund's
position in Russia and to invest in Turkey. On April 1, 2004, the Central Europe
and Russia  Fund  changed its  benchmark  to a new index blend of 45% in Central
Europe  (CECE-Index),  45% in Russia (RTX-Index) and 10% in Turkey  (ISE-Index).
This change will better reflect the regional markets in which the Fund invests.

   At its April 23rd Board  Meeting,  the Board of Directors  elected  Sandra M.
Schaufler as new Chief Investment Officer of your Fund. Located in New York, Ms.
Schaufler will be working closely with the Fund's investment  adviser,  Deutsche
Asset Management International GmbH in Frankfurt.

   Sincerely,

/S/ CHRISTIAN STRENGER                  /S/ RICHARD T. HALE

Index returns assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Fund returns, do not
reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Investments in funds involve risks including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified and may focus its investments in certain
geographical regions, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in
that region. Investing in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic changes and market risks. This may result in greater share price
volatility.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of
which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict
whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION:  On May 1, 2004,  the  European  Union ("EU") has welcomed its ten new
members,  thereby expanding the EU to a total of 25 nations. Before the Euro can
be introduced the new member  countries must fulfill the membership  criteria of
the Exchange Rate Mechanism II ("ERM II"). What is the best strategy for the new
member countries to join ERM II?

ANSWER: There are no hard and fast rules for judging the merits of an entry into
ERM II. Joining ERM II quickly offers the reward of introducing  the Euro early,
but it also has  serious  disadvantages.  The main  benefit  of an early  ERM II
membership is for a country to achieve  relative  price  stability as well as to
improve fiscal  responsibility.  The downside is, that these countries will lose
an important  monetary  policy tool of managing  exchange  rates.  However,  the
threat of potential monetary  instability can be minimized,  if the ERM II entry
is delayed until all the membership criteria have been met. This could also help
to reduce the costs of adjustment  to ERM II. On balance,  there is no "one size
fits all" solution for the accession candidates.

QUESTION:  Most of the new member countries seem to be committed to adopting the
Euro at some point.  With no fixed  timetable laid out, which countries are more
likely to be early candidates?

ANSWER:  The three Baltic States are the most likely countries to adopt the Euro
early,  as their  economies  already  display a low rate of inflation  and sound
fiscal policies.  The European  Central Bank ("ECB") has already  indicated that
the existing currency boards of LITHUANIA and ESTONIA are compatible with ERM II
membership, since they are pegged to the Euro. The same will presumably apply to
LATVIA'S de facto currency board.

HUNGARY and  SLOVENIA  are likewise  tending  towards an early ERM II entry.  In
Hungary, the central bank and government officials hope that their stated policy
of  "self-commitment"  may help to improve fiscal deficit and inflation targets.
At  present,  the value of such a  self-regimentation  is  considered  important
enough to compensate for exchange rate risks. Slovenia is likewise banking on an
early ERM II entry.  Despite a somewhat  high  inflation  rate,  the  country is
looking  to benefit  from the  exchange  rate peg as a  stability  anchor.  Both
countries rightly point to synchronous cyclical trends with the Euro area, which
should make it easier to cope with the loss of an exchange rate policy tool.

POLAND,  the CZECH  REPUBLIC and SLOVAKIA,  seem set to delay joining the ERM II
for the time being. The ECB and European  Commission are commenting in a similar
vein, and the IMF has pointed out that "a breathing space before entering ERM II
would make it  possible to go ahead with a much  needed  fiscal  consolidation".
Sounder  government  finances  may also help to minimize  the danger of currency
speculation,  as none of the three  countries  have much  experience  with fixed
exchange rates.

QUESTION: During the past few weeks Emerging Europe's and Russia's stock markets
have seen a strong  sell-off.  With  some of the  higher-beta  markets,  such as
Russia and Turkey  suffering the worst, is it now a good time to invest in these
markets?

ANSWER:  The main reason for the sell-off  comes from the US, as  investors  are
nervous about inflationary  pressures, as a result of higher oil prices, as well
as a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve Bank.  Additionally,  the Chinese
government's  attempts to cool down its strong economic growth  triggered severe
price erosion in commodities and as a result Russian  commodity  stocks suffered
price declines.  However, the macroeconomic outlook for Russia remains promising
and real GDP growth for 2004 is currently  estimated at 6.7%.  With an estimated
price earnings ratio of 7.1 times for 2004, the Russian market,  in our opinion,
still  looks  attractive.  In the case of Turkey,  the joint  occurrence  of the
Cyprus related political  tensions and the withdrawal of global liquidity led to
a  large  sell-off  in  the  financial   markets  despite   improving   economic
fundamentals.  Turkey's  economic  growth is  supported by lower  inflation  and
interest  rates.   Earnings  have  been  enhanced  by  lower  financing   costs.
Furthermore, the delayed privatization program by the government appears finally
set to move forward again.  In our opinion,  with a market P/E ratio of 12 times
2004  earnings,  Turkish  equities  appear  attractive.  Investments in emerging
market  countries  such as Russia and Turkey are subject to greater risk of loss
than  investments  in developed  countries.  This is due to among other  things,
greater  market  volatility,   lower  trading  volume,  political  and  economic
instability,  greater risk of market shut down and more governmental limitations
on foreign investment policy than those typically found in developed markets.

Fund

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN ECONOMIES

CZECH REPUBLIC:  After a disappointing  first half the pace of economic activity
accelerated  in the second half and resulted in real GDP growth of 2.9% in 2003.
Growth has been driven by personal  consumption  and a strong upturn in business
investments. With the export share as high as 55%, the Czech Republic would be a
primary beneficiary of a pick-up in Western European economic growth. Assuming a
moderate recovery in Western Europe, the economic outlook for the Czech Republic
should gradually improve in 2004 and 2005.  Inflation remained moderate but will
be  far  above  last  year's  0.1%,  and  is  partly   triggered  by  government
administered  price hikes.  Unemployment has been rising, and for the first time
since the fall of communism in November  1989,  again  exceeded the 10% barrier.
Despite the economic  and  political  problems  the Czech  Republic is currently
facing,  the  country  is  still  a  leading   destination  for  foreign  direct
investment.

HUNGARY:  Economic  activity  accelerated  after the second quarter 2003 and GDP
growth picked up in each of the following quarters, resulting in real GDP growth
of 2.9% for all of last year.  Export  growth  has been  outpacing  imports  for
several months, allowing the current account deficit to be reduced.  Despite the
fact,  that inflation has recently  receded from the extreme high levels,  rates
are still much higher  than in Poland and the Czech  Republic,  which  contrasts
sharply with the general  global  disinflationary  trend.  High inflation is the
prime reason for the current  tight  monetary  policy that is limiting  economic
growth.  Still,  the primary area of concern in Hungary is the large  government
budget  deficit,  which stood at 5.7% of GDP in 2003. The Hungarian  market will
continue to face volatility,  as the government and the National Bank of Hungary
come to grips with the pressing matters of the "twin deficits".  Notwithstanding
all  the  economic  problems,  Hungary  is  still  perceived  as  an  attractive
investment  designation by most international  investors and as a relatively low
credit risk by the rating agencies.  Most importantly,  Hungary is well advanced
with its economic reforms and the privatization process.

POLAND:   Economic  and  political  conditions  have  been  moving  in  opposite
directions  in recent  months,  as the economy  strengthened  and the  political
situation  continued to deteriorate.  However,  this seeming  incongruity is not
unusual in Central and Eastern Europe and it has been particularly  prevalent in
Poland.  The Polish economy ended last year on a strong note. Real GDP had grown
4.7% in the fourth  quarter,  which  resulted  in a 3.7%  growth rate for all of
2003,  a  striking  contrast  to the near  stagnant  conditions  two years  ago.
Moreover,  the speed of the economic  activity has  accelerated in recent months
and industrial  production has been rising at  double-digit  rates.  Despite the
strengthening economy, inflation remained well under control, as consumer prices
increased by 1.7% in 2003. However,  inflationary  pressure is increasing due to
rising  commodity  and food  prices,  and the impact of tax and import  tariffs.
Another favorable economic development was the strong export performance,  which
was helped by the undervalued Zloty.  Exports were the main driving force of the
economy and narrowed the current  account  deficit to a mere 1.9% in 2003.  This
generally positive situation has been marred by two important developments.  One
weak  point is the high  rate of  unemployment  and the  other is the  unsettled
fiscal situation.  The deteriorating fiscal situation led to Mr. Leszek Miller's
resignation as Prime Minister.

RUSSIA:  The macroeconomic  picture for Russia remains  promising.  In 2003, the
economy grew by an impressive  7.3%,  up from 4.7% in 2002. In 2003,  industrial
production  (+6.9%),  alongside  with strong  consumption  (+8%) and  investment
(+12.5%),  contributed  significantly to GDP growth. Also, on the back of higher
oil prices,  continuing  strong  investment and robust consumer  demand,  Russia
again  recorded  an  impressive  GDP growth of 8% in the first  quarter of 2004.
Russia, unlike most of its Central European neighbors, has its finances in order
and once again achieved a fiscal surplus of 1.7% of GDP. However,  Russia is one
of the few countries in the world with  surpluses in both the federal budget and
the current account. Additionally, Russia recorded a significant increase in its
gold and  foreign  exchange  reserves,  reaching a  historical  high of USD 76.9
billion  in  2003.  However,   Russia's  economic  dependence  on  international
commodity  markets  continues  to be a major  source  of  risk.  Last  year  the
government  established a  stabilization  fund,  which was created to reduce the
country's  dependence  on  oil.  Helped  by  Putin's  re-election  victory,  the
government  continues to make sound  progress in  structural  reforms.  However,
uncertainties  remain,  created by the Yukos trial and  questions  over  Putin's
goals, that have impacted Russian securities.  The administration has approved a
new fiscal  package with cuts to the unified  social tax rate,  and introduced a
new concept of budget reforms aimed at  streamlining  expenditure and optimizing
the  budgetary  process.  The  Ministry of Finance  estimates  that the proposed
measures will allow  expenditure to increase by 10-20% over the next three years
without raising the tax burden.

TURKEY:  In 2003,  Prime Minister  Erdogan has continued the process of economic
reforms.  Gross  National  Product  growth of 5.9% was  surprisingly  strong and
private consumption and investment rates were robust, growing at 10.3% and 19.2%
respectively  during the year.  Furthermore,  recent data also  confirm that the
disinflation  process  remains in tact as consumer  prices  continue to decline,
while  fiscal  performance  remains  solid.  Following  the  worse-than-expected
current account deficit in January of this year, concerns regarding the widening
external  deficit  continued to escalate,  evidenced by a weak currency,  as the
lira came  under  pressure.  While the  situation  warrants  a certain  level of
concern,  we do not believe  that the current  state is alarming  given the high
level of  foreign  exchange  reserves.  After  having  suffered a setback in the
Cyprus referendum, the Turkish market is likely to have over-reacted, due to the
lack of clarity  surrounding the EU's approach to Turkey.  In the meantime,  the
Turkish  government has accelerated its efforts to meet EU membership  criteria,
and has submitted a constitutional amendment package to the parliament.

THE CENTRAL EUROPE AND RUSSIA FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--APRIL 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The  Central  Europe  and  RussiaFund,  Inc.  is a  non-diversified,  closed-end
management investment company incorporated in Maryland.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations. The Fund had no security lending activity for the period ended April
30, 2004.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.
The  resultant  gains and losses  arising from exchange  rate  fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable to  investments,  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

In the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations which provide general indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code   applicable   to  regulated   investment   companies   and  to  distribute
substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
        ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

The Fund has a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager"),  and an Investment Advisory Agreement with Deutsche Asset Management
International  GmbH (the "Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the Investment
Adviser are affiliated companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $100  million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $100  million.
The Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides the Investment Adviser with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100  million.  Accordingly,  for the period  ended April 30,  2004,  the fee
pursuant to the Management and Investment  Advisory Agreements was equivalent to
an annual effective rate of .88% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser,  in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objective,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders and select  brokers  and  dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions  on
behalf of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for  the  period  ended  April  30,  2004  were   $95,322,562  and  $45,458,230,
respectively.  The cost of investments at October 31, 2003 was  $112,378,144 for
United States Federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, as of October 31, 2003,
net unrealized  appreciation  of investments  aggregated  $58,550,978,  of which
$61,073,178 and $2,522,200 related to unrealized  appreciation and depreciation,
respectively.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward at October 31, 2003 of  approximately  $22,085,000,  of which  $330,000,
$14,942,000 and $6,813,000 will expire in 2006, 2009 and 2010, respectively.  No
capital gains  distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders  until future
net gains have been realized in excess of such carry forward.

NOTE 5. CAPITAL AND RIGHTS OFFERING

During the period ended April 30, 2004 and the year ended October 31, 2003,  the
Fund  purchased  97,300 and  237,400  of its shares of common  stock on the open
market at a total cost of $2,074,803 and $3,905,384,  respectively. The weighted
average  discount of these purchased shares comparing the purchased price to the
net asset value at the time of purchase was 9.35% and 16.9%, respectively. These
shares are held in treasury. In addition, during the period ended April 30, 2004
the  Fund  reissued  37,769  shares  held in  treasury  as part of the  dividend
reinvestment plan.

During  March  2004,  the  Fund  issued  2,555,677  shares  of  common  stock in
connection with a rights  offering of the Fund's shares.  Shareholders of record
on February  24, 2004 were issued one  transferable  right for each share owned.
The rights  entitled the  shareholders to purchase one new share of common stock
for every three rights held. These shares were issued at a subscription price of
$20.82.   Net  proceeds  to  the  Fund  were  $50,713,850  after  deducting  the
solicitation/dealer  manager  fees  of  $1,995,345  and  estimated  expenses  of
$500,000.  The net asset value per share of the Fund's common  shareholders  was
reduced by approximately $2.40 per share as a result of the share issuance.

++   Total investment return based on market value is calculated assuming that
     shares of the Fund's common stock were purchased at the closing market
     price as of the beginning of the year, dividends, capital gains and other
     distributions were reinvested as provided for in the Fund's dividend
     reinvest-ment plan and then sold at the closing market price per share on
     the last day of the year. The computation does not reflect any sales
     commission investors may incur in purchasing or selling shares of the Fund.
     The total investment return based on the net asset value is similarly
     computed except that the Fund's net asset value is substituted for the
     closing market value.
*    The custody credits are attributable to interest earned on U.S. cash
     balances. The ratios of total expenses after custody credits to average net
     assets are 1.28%, 1.50%, 1.54%, 1.62%, 1.35% and 1.43% for 2004, 2003,
     2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
**   Annualized.
***  Not Annualized.
**** Not Annualized. The ratio for six months ended April 30, 2004 has not been
     annualized since the Fund believes it would not be appropriate because the
     Fund's dividend income is not earned ratably throughout the fiscal year.

The Fund offers  shareholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the
plan agent:
