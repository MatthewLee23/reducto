LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders:

    What a difference a year can make. By the end of 2005, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average had lost value over the course of the year, as stocks were
beaten back by a myriad of investor worries, including a spike in oil prices,
a rise in interest rates, and political uncertainty in the Middle East.

    Fast forward to 2006, and we have seen a dramatically different picture.
While there were some fluctuations in the global markets in the first half of
the year, the second half of 2006 has, so far, been good to many investors.
Oil prices retreated, boosting consumer confidence, and interest rates have
held steady. U.S. stock markets responded favorably to this news, as the Dow
reached a record high in October, passing the 12,000 mark.

    What does all of this mean for you? If you're focused on a long-term
investment strategy, the high points in the road -- and the bumps -- should
not necessarily dictate portfolio action on your part. Markets are inherently
cyclical, and we firmly believe that investors who remain committed to a long-
term investment strategy are more likely to achieve their goals than those who
consistently chase short-term performance.

    At MFS(R), our unique teamwork approach to managing money and our global
research platform support an unwavering focus on helping you realize your
long-term financial goals. We believe in a three-pronged investment strategy
of allocating your holdings across major asset classes, diversifying within
each class, and rebalancing regularly. Of course, these strategies cannot
guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. Investing and planning for the
long term require diligence and patience -- two traits that are essential to
capitalizing on the many opportunities the financial markets can offer.


    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

    January 16, 2007

              ------------------------------------------------

(a) The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
    weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
    agencies.
(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price is likely to fluctuate with
    general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond with a
    5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(i) For purposes of this graphical presentation, the bond component includes
    both accrued interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any
    derivative holdings, if applicable.
(m) The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
    the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which have
    been pre- refunded or pre-paid to an earlier date or which have a mandatory
    put date prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown takes into
    account these earlier dates.
(r) Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
    rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
    Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based on
    the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a security
    which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is considered
    Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency mortgage-backed
    securities, if any, are included in the "AAA"-rating category. Percentages
    are based on the total market value of investments as of 11/30/06.

Percentages are based on net assets as of 11/30/06, unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed and current holdings may be different.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the twelve months ended November 30, 2006, the MFS Government Markets
Income Trust provided a total return of 5.74%, at net asset value. This
compares with a return of 5.85% for the trust's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers
U.S. Government/Mortgage Bond Index.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

Over the reporting period, the trust's yield curve(y) positioning held back
relative results.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

The trust's foreign currency exposure contributed to relative performance. Our
positioning in agency related securities and some sovereign debt securities of
Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain also generated positive results.

Respectfully,

Geoffrey Schechter
Portfolio Manager

Note to Shareholders: Effective April 1, 2006, Geoffrey Schechter became
portfolio manager of the trust replacing Peter Vaream.

(y) A yield curve graphically depicts the yields of different maturity bonds of
    the same credit quality and type; a normal yield curve is upward sloping,
    with short-term rates lower than long-term rates.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers U.S. Government/Mortgage Bond Index - measures debt issued by
the U.S. Government as well as mortgage-backed pass-through securities of
Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset
value underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive
less than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As
a result, the total returns that are calculated based on the net asset value
and New York Stock Exchange prices can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as
a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her shares
and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be treated as
gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of shareholder capital
have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and may increase the trust's
expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio's yield and share prices change daily based on the credit quality
of its investments and changes in interest rates. In general, the value of debt
securities will decline when interest rates rise and will increase when
interest rates fall. Debt securities with longer maturity dates will be subject
to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter maturities. Mortgage
securities are subject to prepayment risk which can offer less potential for
gains in a declining interest rate environment and greater potential for loss
in a rising interest rate environment. Derivatives involve risks that may be
different from, and potentially greater than, those of the underlying
indicator's in whose value the derivative is based. The value of the derivative
can move in unexpected ways and result in unanticipated losses and increased
volatility if the value of the underlying indicator(s) does not move in the
direction or the extent anticipated. Interest payments on inflation adjusted
debt instruments can be unpredictable and vary based on the level of inflation.
The value of floating rate loans depends on the credit quality and adequacy of
the collateral securing the loan. Enforcing rights against the collateral may
be difficult or insufficient if the borrower of the floating rate loan
defaults. Foreign investments can be more volatile than U.S. investments.
Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the portfolio's net asset value,
the value of dividends and interest earned and gains and losses realized on the
sale of securities. Investing in emerging markets can involve risks in addition
to those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign markets.
When you sell your shares, they may be worth more or less than the amount you
paid for them. Please see the prospectus for further information regarding
these and other risk considerations.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on such
terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND
CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you
to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the
shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price
of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.
Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in any amount
over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please have
available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details. When you
withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in
one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the trust's financial performance for the past 5 years.
Certain information reflects financial results for a single trust share. The total returns in the table represent the rate by
which an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the trust share class (assuming reinvestment of all
distributions) held for the entire period. This information has been audited by the trust's independent registered public
accounting firm, whose report, together with the trust's financial statements, are included in this report.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the trust) is organized as a Massachusetts
business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as a closed-end diversified management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest in foreign securities, including securities of emerging market
issuers. Investments in foreign securities are vulnerable to the effects of
changes in the relative values of the local currency and the U.S. dollar and to
the effects of changes in each country's legal, political, and economic
environment. The markets of emerging markets countries are generally more
volatile than the markets of developed countries with more mature economies.
All of the risks of investing in foreign securities previously described are
heightened when investing in emerging markets countries.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated or
composite bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Values of debt
instruments obtained from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied
valuations and electronic data processing techniques, which take into account
factors such as institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities,
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics,
and other market data. Short-term instruments with a maturity at issuance of 60
days or less may be valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
Futures contracts are generally valued at last posted settlement price as
reported by an independent pricing service on the market on which they are
primarily traded. Futures contracts for which there were no trades that day for
a particular position are generally valued at the closing bid quotation as
reported by an independent pricing service on the market on which they are
primarily traded. Forward foreign currency contracts are generally valued at
the mean of bid and asked prices for the time period interpolated from rates
reported by an independent pricing service for proximate time periods.
Securities and other assets generally valued on the basis of information from
an independent pricing service may also be valued at a broker-dealer bid
quotation. The values of foreign securities and other assets and liabilities
expressed in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the mean of
bid and asked prices for rates reported by an independent pricing service.

The Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility for determining or
causing to be determined the value of the trust's investments (including any
fair valuation) to the adviser pursuant to valuation policies and procedures
approved by the Board. If the adviser determines that reliable market
quotations are not readily available, investments are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with such procedures
under the oversight of the Board of Trustees. Under the trust's valuation
policies and procedures, market quotations are not considered to be readily
available for many types of debt instruments. These investments are generally
valued at fair value based on information from independent pricing services. In
addition, investments may be valued at fair value if the adviser determines
that an investment's value has been materially affected by events occurring
after the close of the exchange or market on which the investment is
principally traded (such as foreign exchange or market) and prior to the
determination of the trust's net asset value, or after the halting of trading
of a specific security where trading does not resume prior to the close of the
exchange or market on which the security is principally traded. Events that
occur on a frequent basis after foreign markets close (such as developments in
foreign markets and significant movements in the U.S. markets) and prior to the
determination of the trust's net asset value may be deemed to have a material
affect on the value of securities traded in foreign markets. Accordingly, the
trust's foreign equity securities may often be valued at fair value. The
adviser may rely on independent pricing services or other information (such as
the correlation with price movements of similar securities in the same or other
markets; the type, cost and investment characteristics of the security; the
business and financial condition of the issuer; and trading and other market
data) to assist in determining whether to fair value and at what value to fair
value an investment. The value of an investment for purposes of calculating the
trust's net asset value can differ depending on the source and method used to
determine value. When fair valuation is used, the value of investments used to
determine the trust's net asset value may differ from quoted or published
prices for the same investments.

In September 2006, FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (the
"Statement") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 and for all interim periods within those fiscal years. This
Statement provides a single definition of fair value, a hierarchy for measuring
fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. Management
is evaluating the application of the Statement to the trust, and believes the
impact will be limited to expanded disclosures resulting from the adoption of
this Statement in the trust's financial statements.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust requires
that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to
the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to obtain those
securities in the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The trust
monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its
value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the trust
under each such repurchase agreement. The trust, along with other affiliated
entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), may utilize a joint
trading account for the purpose of entering into one or more repurchase
agreements.

INFLATION-ADJUSTED DEBT SECURITIES - The trust invests in inflation-adjusted
debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. The trust may also invest in
inflation-adjusted debt securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and
instrumentalities other than the U.S. Treasury and by other entities such as
U.S. and foreign corporations and foreign governments. The principal value of
these debt securities is adjusted by references to changes in the Consumer
Price Index or another general price or wage index. These debt securities
typically pay a fixed rate of interest, but this fixed rate is applied to the
inflation-adjusted principal amount. The principal paid at maturity of the debt
security is typically equal to the inflation-adjusted principal amount, or the
security's original par value, whichever is greater. Other types of
inflation-adjusted securities may use other methods to adjust for other
measures of inflation.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of both
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The trust may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-
hedging purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains. When the trust uses derivatives as an investment to
gain market exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from derivative
instruments may be substantially greater than the derivative's original cost.
Derivative instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
futures contracts.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at
a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is
required to deposit with the broker either in cash or securities an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are
made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as
unrealized gains or losses by the trust. Upon entering into such contracts, the
trust bears the risk of interest or exchange rates or securities prices moving
unexpectedly, in which case, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits
of the futures contracts and may realize a loss.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value
of the contract. The trust may enter into forward foreign currency exchange
contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging
purposes, the trust may enter into contracts to deliver or receive foreign
currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment activities.
The trust may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect foreign
currency denominated securities from declines in value due to unfavorable
exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the trust may enter into
contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the trust's
portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of
anticipated changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are
adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or
losses are recorded as unrealized until the contract settlement date. On
contract settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded as realized gains or
losses on foreign currency transactions.

INDEMNIFICATIONS - Under the trust's organizational documents, its officers and
trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to the trust. Additionally, in the
normal course of business, the trust enters into agreements with service
providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The trust's maximum
exposure under these agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims
that may be made against the trust that have not yet occurred.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All discount is
accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax
regulations.

The trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements involving its
portfolio holdings. Any proceeds received are reflected in realized gain/loss
in the Statement of Operations, or in unrealized gain/loss if the security is
still held by the trust.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the year ended November 30, 2006, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust intends to qualify as a regulated
investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code,
and to distribute all of its taxable income, including realized capital gains.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is required in the financial
statements. Foreign taxes, if any, have been accrued by the trust in the
accompanying financial statements.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are
periodically adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax
character. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value
per share. Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain items of
income, expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and
tax purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess
of net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions
for financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and tax
purposes.

Book/tax differences primarily relate to amortization and accretion of debt
securities, straddle loss deferrals, and foreign currency transactions.

The tax character of distributions declared to shareholders is as follows:

                                                      11/30/06       11/30/05

Ordinary income (including any short-term
capital gains)                                     $18,296,971    $16,936,571

The federal tax cost and the tax basis components of distributable earnings
were as follows:

          Other temporary differences                    (1,323,108)

offset future realized gains. Such losses expire as follows:

              11/30/07                                 $(11,594,208)

              Total                                    $(22,831,879)

In June 2006, FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes (the "Interpretation") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as
of no later than May 30, 2008. This Interpretation prescribes a minimum
threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and requires certain expanded
disclosures. Management is evaluating the application of the Interpretation to
the trust, and has not at this time determined the impact, if any, resulting
from the adoption of this Interpretation on the trust's financial statements.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with MFS to
provide overall investment management and related administrative services and
facilities to the trust. The management fee is computed daily and paid monthly
at an annual rate of 0.32% of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of
gross income. Gross income is calculated based on tax elections that generally
include the accretion of discount and exclude the amortization of premium,
which may differ from investment income reported in the Statement of
Operations. The management fee, from net assets and gross income, incurred for
the year ended November 30, 2006 was equivalent to an annual effective rate of
0.62% of the trust's average daily net assets.

TRANSFER AGENT - MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
MFS, receives a fee from the trust for its services as registrar and dividend-
disbursing agent. Pursuant to a written agreement, the trust pays MFSC an
account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a dividend services fee of
$0.75 per reinvestment. For the year ended November 30, 2006, these fees
amounted to $90,342. MFSC also receives payment from the trust for out-of-
pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the trust. For the year ended
November 30, 2006, these costs amounted to $37,610.

Computershare Trust Company, N.A. became the Transfer Agent and Registrar of
the trust effective December 18, 2006, succeeding MFSC.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to the trust.
Under an administrative services agreement, the trust partially reimburses MFS
the costs incurred to provide these services. The trust is charged a fixed
amount plus a fee based on calendar year average net assets. From July 1, 2005
through March 31, 2006, the trust's annual fixed amount was $10,000. Effective
April 1, 2006, the trust's annual fixed amount is $17,500.

The administrative services fee incurred for the year ended November 30, 2006
was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.0178% of the trust average
daily net assets.

TRUSTEES' AND OFFICERS' COMPENSATION - The trust pays compensation to
independent trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional
compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The trust does not pay
compensation directly to trustees or to officers of the trust who are also
officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers and trustees of the trust are
officers or directors of MFS and MFSC. The trust has an unfunded, defined
benefit plan for certain retired independent trustees which resulted in a
pension expense of $12,240. The trust also has an unfunded retirement benefit
deferral plan for certain independent trustees which resulted in an expense of
$2,927. Both amounts are included in independent trustees' compensation for the
year ended November 30, 2006. The liability for deferred retirement benefits
payable to certain independent trustees under both plans amounted to $167,487
at November 30, 2006, and is included in payable for independent trustees'
compensation.

DEFERRED TRUSTEE COMPENSATION - Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan)
independent trustees previously were allowed to elect to defer receipt of all
or a portion of their annual compensation. Trustees are no longer allowed to
defer compensation under the Plan. Amounts previously deferred are treated as
though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the trust or
other MFS funds selected by the trustee. Deferred amounts represent an
unsecured obligation of the trust until distributed in accordance with the
Plan. Included in other assets and payable for independent trustees'
compensation is $12,906 of deferred trustees' compensation.

OTHER - This trust and certain other MFS funds (the funds) have entered into a
services agreement (the Agreement) which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other funds managed by MFS participate in a $1 billion unsecured

agreement. In addition, the trust and other funds managed by MFS have
established uncommitted borrowing arrangements with certain banks. Borrowings
may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to each fund,
based on its borrowings, generally at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds
rate plus 0.35%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average daily,
unused portion of the committed line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. For the year ended
November 30, 2006, the trust's commitment fee and interest expense were $2,362
and $0, respectively, and are included in miscellaneous expense on the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To The Trustees and the Shareholders of MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the
"Trust") as of November 30, 2006, and the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2006, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received
from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS Government
Markets Income Trust as of November 30, 2006, the results of its operations for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of the five years
in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

    Mr. Butler a total of $351,119.29.

The Trust holds annual shareholder meetings for the purpose of electing Trustees, and Trustees are
elected for fixed terms. The Board of Trustees is currently divided into three classes, each having a
term of three years.

Each year the term of one class expires. Each Trustee's term of office expires on the date of the third
annual meeting following the election to office of the Trustee's class. Each Trustee and officer will
serve until next elected or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement or removal.

Messrs. Butler, Gutow, Sherratt and Uek and Ms. Thomsen are members of the Trust's Audit Committee.

Each of the Trust's Trustees and officers holds comparable positions with certain other funds of which
MFS or a subsidiary is the investment adviser or distributor, and, in the case of the officers, with
certain affiliates of MFS. As of January 1, 2006, the Trustees served as board members of 98 funds
within the MFS Family of Funds.

The Statement of Additional Information for the Trust and further information about the Trustees are
available without charge upon request by calling 1-800-225-2606.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT
ADVISORY AGREEMENT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that both the full Board of
Trustees and a majority of the non-interested ("independent") Trustees, voting
separately, annually approve the continuation of the Fund's investment advisory
agreement with MFS. The Trustees consider matters bearing on the Fund and its
advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year, including a review
of performance data at each regular meeting. In addition, the independent
Trustees met several times over the course of three months beginning in May and
ending in July, 2006 ("contract review meetings") for the specific purpose of
considering whether to approve the continuation of the investment advisory
agreement for the Fund and the other investment companies that the Board
oversees (the "MFS Funds"). The independent Trustees were assisted in their
evaluation of the Fund's investment advisory agreement by independent legal
counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met
separately from MFS during various contract review meetings. The independent
Trustees were also assisted in this process by the MFS Funds' Independent Chief
Compliance Officer, a full-time senior officer appointed by and reporting to
the independent Trustees.

In connection with their deliberations regarding the continuation of the
investment advisory agreement, the Trustees, including the independent
Trustees, considered such information and factors as they believed, in light of
the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be
relevant. The investment advisory agreement for the Fund was considered
separately, although the Trustees also took into account the common interests
of all MFS Funds in their review. As described below, the Trustees considered
the nature, quality, and extent of the various investment advisory,
administrative, and shareholder services performed by MFS under the existing
investment advisory agreement and other arrangements with the Fund.

In connection with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and
relied upon materials which included, among other items: (i) information
provided by Lipper Inc. on the investment performance (based on net asset
value) of the Fund for various time periods ended December 31, 2005 and the
investment performance (based on net asset value) of a group of funds with
substantially similar investment classifications/objectives (the "Lipper
performance universe"), as well as the investment performance (based on net
asset value) of a group of funds identified by objective criteria suggested by
MFS ("MFS peer funds"), (ii) information provided by Lipper Inc. on the Fund's
advisory fees and other expenses and the advisory fees and other expenses of
comparable funds identified by Lipper (the "Lipper expense group"), as well as
the advisory fees and other expenses of MFS peer funds, (iii) information
provided by MFS on the advisory fees of comparable portfolios of other clients
of MFS, including institutional separate accounts and other clients, (iv)
information as to whether and to what extent applicable expense waivers,
reimbursements or fee "breakpoints" are observed for the Fund, (v) information
regarding MFS' financial results and financial condition, including MFS' and
certain of its affiliates' estimated profitability from services performed for
the Fund and the MFS Funds as a whole, (vi) MFS' views regarding the outlook
for the mutual fund industry and the strategic business plans of MFS, (vii)
descriptions of various functions performed by MFS for the Funds, such as
compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices, and (viii) information
regarding the overall organization of MFS, including information about MFS'
senior management and other personnel providing investment advisory,
administrative and other services to the Fund and the other MFS Funds. The
comparative performance, fee and expense information prepared and provided by
Lipper Inc. was not independently verified and the independent Trustees did not
independently verify any information provided to them by MFS.

The Trustees' conclusion as to the continuation of the investment advisory
agreement was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information
provided to the Trustees and not the result of any single factor. Some of the
factors that figured particularly in the Trustees' deliberations are described
below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information
presented differently from one another, giving different weights to various
factors. It is also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for the
Fund and other MFS Funds are the result of years of review and discussion
between the independent Trustees and MFS, that certain aspects of such
arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some years than others, and that
the Trustees' conclusions may be based, in part, on their consideration of
these same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years.

Based on information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS, the Trustees reviewed the
Fund's total return investment performance as well as the performance of peer
groups of funds over various time periods. The Trustees placed particular
emphasis on the total return performance of the Fund's common shares in
comparison to the performance of funds in its Lipper performance universe over
the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, which the Trustees believed was
a long enough period to reflect differing market conditions. The Fund ranked
2nd out of a total of 2 funds in the Lipper performance universe for this
three-year period (a ranking of 1st place out of the total number of funds in
the performance universe indicating the best performer and a ranking of last
place out of the total number of funds in the performance universe indicating
the worst performer). The total return performance of the Fund's common shares
ranked 3rd out of a total of 3 funds for the one-year period and 1st out of a
total of 2 funds for the five-year period ended December 31, 2005. Given the
size of the Lipper performance universe and information previously provided by
MFS regarding differences between the Fund and other funds in its Lipper
performance universe, the Trustees also reviewed the Fund's performance in
comparison to a custom benchmark developed by MFS. The Fund had the same
performance as its custom benchmark for the one-year period ended December 31,
2005 and out-performed its custom benchmark for each of the three- and five-
year periods ended December 31, 2005. Because of the passage of time, these
performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent
periods, including those shown elsewhere in this report.

In the course of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account
information provided by MFS in connection with the contract review meetings, as
well as during investment review meetings conducted with portfolio management
personnel during the course of the year regarding the Fund's performance. After
reviewing these and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the context
of their overall conclusions regarding the investment advisory agreement, that
they were satisfied with MFS' responses and efforts relating to investment
performance.

In assessing the reasonableness of the Fund's advisory fee, the Trustees
considered, among other information, the Fund's advisory fee and the total
expense ratio of the Fund's common shares as a percentage of average net assets
and the advisory fee and total expense ratios of peer groups of funds based on
information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS. The Trustees considered that,
according to the Lipper data, the Fund's effective advisory fee rate and total
expense ratio were each approximately at the Lipper expense group median.

The Trustees also considered the advisory fees charged by MFS to institutional
accounts. In comparing these fees, the Trustees considered information provided
by MFS as to the generally broader scope of services provided by MFS to the
Fund in comparison to institutional accounts and the impact on MFS and expenses
associated with the more extensive regulatory regime to which the Fund is
subject in comparison to institutional accounts.

The Trustees considered that, as a closed-end fund, the Fund is unlikely to
experience meaningful asset growth. As a result, the Trustees did not view the
potential for realization of economies of scale as the Fund's assets grow to be
a material factor in their deliberations. The Trustees noted that they would
consider economies of scale in the future in the event the Fund experiences
significant asset growth, such as through an offering of preferred shares
(which is not currently contemplated) or a material increase in the market
value of the Fund's portfolio securities.

The Trustees also considered information prepared by MFS relating to MFS' costs
and profits with respect to the Fund, the MFS Funds considered as a group, and
other investment companies and accounts advised by MFS, as well as MFS'
methodologies used to determine and allocate its costs to the MFS Funds, the
Fund and other accounts and products for purposes of estimating profitability.

After reviewing these and other factors described herein, the Trustees
concluded, within the context of their overall conclusions regarding the
investment advisory agreement, that the advisory fees charged to the Fund
represent reasonable compensation in light of the services being provided by
MFS to the Fund.

In addition, the Trustees considered MFS' resources and related efforts to
continue to retain, attract and motivate capable personnel to serve the Fund.
The Trustees also considered current and developing conditions in the financial
services industry, including the entry into the industry of large and
well-capitalized companies which are spending, and appear to be prepared to
continue to spend, substantial sums to engage personnel and to provide services
to competing investment companies. In this regard, the Trustees also considered
the financial resources of MFS and its ultimate parent, Sun Life Financial Inc.
The Trustees also considered the advantages and possible disadvantages to the
Fund of having an adviser which also serves other investment companies as well
as other accounts.

The Trustees also considered the nature, quality, cost, and extent of
administrative services provided to the Fund by MFS under agreements other than
the investment advisory agreement. The Trustees also considered the nature,
extent and quality of certain other services MFS performs or arranges for on
the Fund's behalf, which may include securities lending programs, directed
expense payment programs, class action recovery programs, and MFS' interaction
with third-party service providers, principally custodians and sub-custodians.
The Trustees concluded that the various non-advisory services provided by MFS
and its affiliates on behalf of the Funds were satisfactory.

The Trustees also considered benefits to MFS from the use of the Fund's
portfolio brokerage commissions, if applicable, to pay for investment research
(excluding third-party research, for which MFS pays directly) and various other
factors. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called "fall-out benefits" to
MFS such as reputational value derived from serving as investment manager to
the Fund.

Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material, including
those factors described above, the Board of Trustees, including a majority of
the independent Trustees, concluded that the Fund's investment advisory
agreement with MFS should be continued for an additional one-year period,
commencing August 1, 2006.

A discussion regarding the Board's most recent review and renewal of the Fund's
investment advisory agreement is available by visiting the Closed-End section
of the MFS Web site (mfs.com).

The Registrant has adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and as defined in Form N-CSR that applies to the

  # This amount reflects the aggregate fees billed by Deloitte for non-audit services rendered to the Fund and for
    non-audit services rendered to MFS and the MFS Related Entities.
(1) The fees included under "Audit-Related Fees" are fees related to assurance and related services that are
    reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements, but not reported under
    "Audit Fees," including accounting consultations, agreed-upon procedure reports, attestation reports, comfort
    letters and internal control reviews.
(2) The fees included under "Tax Fees" are fees associated with tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning,
    including services relating to the filing or amendment of federal, state or local income tax returns, regulated
    investment company qualification reviews and tax distribution and analysis.
(3) The fees included under "All Other Fees" are fees for products and services provided by Deloitte other than
    those reported under "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees", including fees for services related to
    sales tax refunds, consultation on internal cost allocations, consultation on allocation of monies pursuant to
    an administrative proceeding regarding disclosure of brokerage allocation practices in connection with fund
    sales, and analysis of certain portfolio holdings verses investment styles.

ITEM 4(e)(1):
Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and
non-audit related services: To the extent required by applicable law,
pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the Board is needed for all audit and
permissible non-audit services rendered to the Fund and all permissible
non-audit services rendered to MFS or MFS Related Entities if the services
relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant.
Pre-approval is currently on an engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event
pre-approval of such services is necessary between regular meetings of the
Audit Committee and it is not practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the
next regular meeting of the Audit Committee, pre-approval of such services may
be referred to the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval; provided that the
Chair may not pre-approve any individual engagement for such services exceeding
$50,000 or multiple engagements for such services in the aggregate exceeding
$100,000 between such regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement
pre-approved by the Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall
be presented for ratification by the entire Audit Committee at its next
regularly scheduled meeting.

ITEM 4(e)(2):
None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and
All Other Fees paid by the Fund and MFS and MFS Related Entities relating
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant disclosed
above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C)
of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after
the start of the engagement with respect to services other than audit, review
or attest services, if certain conditions are satisfied).

ITEM 4(f): Not applicable.

ITEM 4(h): The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the
provision by a Registrant's independent registered public accounting firm of
non-audit services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved
by the Committee (because such services were provided prior to the
effectiveness of SEC rules requiring pre-approval or because such services did
not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Registrant) was compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent
registered public accounting firm as the Registrant's principal auditors.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The Registrant has an Audit Committee established in accordance with Section

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Trustees and the Board of Managers of the investment
companies (the "MFS Funds") advised by Massachusetts Financial Services Company
("MFS") have delegated to MFS the right and obligation to vote proxies for
shares that are owned by the MFS Funds, in accordance with MFS' proxy voting
policies and procedures (the "MFS Proxy Policies"). The MFS Proxy Policies are
set forth below:

                    MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

             SEPTEMBER 17, 2003, AS REVISED ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2004,
                       MARCH 15, 2005 AND MARCH 1, 2006

         Massachusetts Financial Services Company, MFS Institutional Advisors,
Inc. and MFS' other investment adviser subsidiaries (collectively, "MFS") have
adopted proxy voting policies and procedures, as set forth below ("MFS Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures"), with respect to securities owned by the
clients for which MFS serves as investment adviser and has the power to vote
proxies, including the registered investment companies sponsored by MFS, other
than the MFS Union Standard Equity Fund (the "MFS Funds"). References to
"clients" in these policies and procedures include the MFS Funds and other
clients of MFS, such as funds organized offshore, sub-advised funds and
separate account clients, to the extent these clients have delegated to MFS the
responsibility to vote proxies on their behalf under the MFS Proxy Voting
Policies and Procedures.

                  The MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures include:

                  A. Voting Guidelines;

                  B. Administrative Procedures;

                  C. Monitoring System;

                  D. Records Retention; and

                  E. Reports.

A. VOTING GUIDELINES

    1. GENERAL POLICY; POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         MFS' policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what MFS
believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not
in the interests of any other party or in MFS' corporate interests, including
interests such as the distribution of MFS Fund shares, administration of 401(k)
plans, and institutional relationships.

         MFS has carefully reviewed matters that in recent years have been
presented for shareholder vote by either management or shareholders of public
companies. Based on the overall principle that all votes cast by MFS on behalf
of its clients must be in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
interests of such clients, MFS has adopted proxy voting guidelines, set forth
below, that govern how MFS generally will vote on specific matters presented
for shareholder vote. In all cases, MFS will exercise its discretion in voting
on these matters in accordance with this overall principle. In other words, the
underlying guidelines are simply that - guidelines. Proxy items of significance
are often considered on a case-by-case basis, in light of all relevant facts
and circumstances, and in certain cases MFS may vote proxies in a manner
different from these guidelines.

         As a general matter, MFS maintains a consistent voting position on
similar proxy proposals with respect to various issuers. In addition, MFS
generally votes consistently on the same matter when securities of an issuer
are held by multiple client accounts. However, MFS recognizes that there are
gradations in certain types of proposals that might result in different voting
positions being taken with respect to different proxy statements. There also
may be situations involving matters presented for shareholder vote that are not
clearly governed by the guidelines, such as proposed mergers and acquisitions.
Some items that otherwise would be acceptable will be voted against the
proponent when it is seeking extremely broad flexibility without offering a
valid explanation. MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines with
respect to a particular shareholder vote when such an override is, in MFS' best
judgment, consistent with the overall principle of voting proxies in the best
long-term economic interests of MFS' clients.

     From time to time, MFS receives comments on these guidelines as well as
regarding particular voting issues from its clients and corporate issuers.
These comments are carefully considered by MFS, when it reviews these
guidelines each year and revises them as appropriate.

     These policies and procedures are intended to address any potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that are
likely to arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS'
clients. If such potential material conflicts of interest do arise, MFS will
analyze, document and report on such potential material conflicts of interest
(see Sections B.2 and E below), and shall ultimately vote the relevant proxies
in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
clients. The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring and reporting
with respect to such potential material conflicts of interest.

    2. MFS' Policy on Specific Issues

         ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

         MFS believes that good governance should be based on a board with a
majority of directors who are "independent" of management, and whose key
committees (e.g., compensation, nominating, and audit committees) are comprised
entirely of "independent" directors. While MFS generally supports the board's
nominees in uncontested elections, we will withhold our vote for a nominee for
a board of a U.S. issuer if, as a result of such nominee being elected to the
board, the board would be comprised of a majority of members who are not
"independent" or, alternatively, the compensation, nominating or audit
committees would include members who are not "independent." MFS will also
withhold its vote for a nominee to the board if we can determine that he or she
failed to attend at least 75% of the board and/or relevant committee meetings
in the previous year without a valid reason. In addition, MFS will withhold its
vote for all nominees standing for election to a board of a U.S. issuer if we
can determine: (1) if, since the last annual meeting of shareholders and
without shareholder approval, the board or its compensation committee has
repriced underwater options; or (2) if, within the last year, shareholders
approved by majority vote a resolution recommending that the board rescind a
"poison pill" and the board has failed to take responsive action to that
resolution. Responsive action would include the rescission of the "poison
pill"(without a broad reservation to reinstate the "poison pill" in the event
of a hostile tender offer), or public assurances that the terms of the "poison
pill" would be put to a binding shareholder vote within the next five to seven
years.

         MFS evaluates a contested election of directors on a case-by-case
basis considering the long-term financial performance of the company relative
to its industry, management's track record, the qualifications of the nominees
for both slates and an evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders.

         MFS votes for reasonably crafted proposals calling for directors to be
elected with an affirmative majority of votes cast and/or the elimination of
the plurality standard for electing directors (including binding resolutions
requesting that the board amend the company's bylaws), provided the proposal
includes a carve-out for a plurality voting standard when there are more
director nominees than board seats (e.g., contested elections) ("Majority Vote
Proposals").

         MFS considers voting against Majority Vote Proposals if the company
has adopted, or has proposed to adopt in the proxy statement, formal corporate
governance principles that present a meaningful alternative to the majority
voting standard and provide an adequate response to both new nominees as well
as incumbent nominees who fail to receive a majority of votes cast.

         MFS believes that a company's election policy should address the
specific circumstances at that company. MFS considers whether a company's
election policy articulates the following elements to address each director
nominee who fails to receive an affirmative majority of votes cast in an
election:

o Establish guidelines for the process by which the company determines the
  status of nominees who fail to receive an affirmative majority of votes cast
  and disclose the guidelines in the annual proxy statement;
o Guidelines should include a reasonable timetable for resolution of the
  nominee's status and a requirement that the resolution be disclosed together
  with the reasons for the resolution;
o Vest management of the process in the company's independent directors, other
  than the nominee in question; and
o Outline the range of remedies that the independent directors may consider
  concerning the nominee.

         CLASSIFIED BOARDS

         MFS opposes proposals to classify a board (e.g., a board in which only
  one-third of board members are elected each year). MFS supports proposals to
  declassify a board.

         NON-SALARY COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

         Restricted stock plans should reward results rather than tenure. In
some cases, restricted stock is granted to the recipient at deep discounts to
fair market value, sometimes at par value. The holder cannot sell for a period
of years, but in the meantime the holder is able to vote and receive dividends.
Eventually the restrictions lapse and the stock can be sold by the holder.

         MFS votes against stock option programs for officers, employees or
non-employee directors that do not require an investment by the optionee, that
give "free rides" on the stock price, or that permit grants of stock options
with an exercise price below fair market value on the date the options are
granted.

         MFS opposes stock option programs that allow the board or the
compensation committee, without shareholder approval, to reprice underwater
options or to automatically replenish shares (i.e., evergreen plans). MFS will
consider on a case-by-case basis proposals to exchange existing options for
newly issued options (taking into account such factors as whether there is a
reasonable value-for-value exchange).

         MFS opposes stock option and restricted stock plans that provide
unduly generous compensation for officers, directors or employees, or could
result in excessive dilution to other shareholders. As a general guideline, MFS
votes against stock option and restricted stock plans if all such plans for a
particular company involve potential dilution, in the aggregate, of more than
15%. However, MFS may accept a higher percentage (up to 20%) in the case of
startup or small companies which cannot afford to pay large salaries to
executives, or in the case where MFS, based upon the issuer's public
disclosures, believes that the issuer has been responsible with respect to its
recent compensation practices, including the mix of the issuance of restricted
stock and options.

         MFS votes in favor of stock option or restricted stock plans for
non-employee directors as long as they satisfy the requirements set forth above
with respect to stock option and restricted stock plans for company executives.

         EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS

         While we acknowledge that there is no agreement on a uniform
methodology for expensing stock options, MFS supports shareholder proposals to
expense stock options because we believe that the expensing of options presents
a more accurate picture of the company's financial results to investors. We
also believe that companies are likely to be more disciplined when granting
options if the value of stock options were treated as an expense item on the
company's income statements.

         EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         MFS believes that competitive compensation packages are necessary to
attract, motivate and retain executives. Therefore, MFS opposes shareholder
proposals that seek to set limits on executive compensation. Shareholder
proposals seeking to set limits on executive compensation tend to specify
arbitrary compensation criteria. MFS also opposes shareholder requests for
disclosure on executive compensation beyond regulatory requirements because we
believe that current regulatory requirements for disclosure of executive
compensation are appropriate and that additional disclosure is often
unwarranted and costly. Although we support linking executive stock option
grants to a company's stock performance, MFS opposes shareholder proposals that
mandate a link of performance-based options to a specific industry or peer
group index. MFS believes that compensation committees should retain the
flexibility to propose the appropriate index or other criteria by which
performance-based options should be measured. MFS evaluates other executive
compensation restrictions (e.g., terminating the company's stock option or
restricted stock programs, freezing executive pay during periods of large
layoffs, and establishing a maximum ratio between the highest paid executive
and lowest paid employee) based on whether such proposals are in the best
long-term economic interests of our clients.

         EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS

         MFS supports the use of a broad-based employee stock purchase plans to
increase company stock ownership by employees, provided that shares purchased
under the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of their market value and do
not result in excessive dilution.

         "GOLDEN PARACHUTES"

         From time to time, shareholders of companies have submitted proxy
proposals that would require shareholder approval of severance packages for
executive officers that exceed certain predetermined thresholds. MFS votes in
favor of such shareholder proposals when they would require shareholder
approval of any severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a
certain multiple of such officer's annual compensation that is not determined
in MFS' judgment to be excessive.

         ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES

         In general, MFS votes against any measure that inhibits capital
appreciation in a stock, including proposals that protect management from
action by shareholders. These types of proposals take many forms, ranging from
"poison pills" and "shark repellents" to super-majority requirements.

         MFS will vote for proposals to rescind existing "poison pills" and
proposals that would require shareholder approval to adopt prospective "poison
pills." Nevertheless, MFS will consider supporting the adoption of a
prospective "poison pill" or the continuation of an existing "poison pill" if
the following two conditions are met: (1) the "poison pill" allows MFS clients
to hold an aggregate position of up to 15% of a company's total voting
securities (and of any class of voting securities); and (2) either (a) the
"poison pill" has a term of not longer than five years, provided that MFS will
consider voting in favor of the "poison pill" if the term does not exceed seven
years and the "poison pill" is linked to a business strategy or purpose that
MFS believes is likely to result in greater value for shareholders; or (b) the
terms of the "poison pill" allow MFS clients the opportunity to accept a fairly
structured and attractively priced tender offer (e.g., a "chewable poison pill"
that automatically dissolves in the event of an all cash, all shares tender
offer at a premium price).

         MFS will consider on a case-by-case basis proposals designed to
prevent tenders which are disadvantageous to shareholders such as tenders at
below market prices and tenders for substantially less than all shares of an
issuer.

         REINCORPORATION AND REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS

         When presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company under the
laws of a different state, or to effect some other type of corporate
reorganization, MFS considers the underlying purpose and ultimate effect of
such a proposal in determining whether or not to support such a measure. While
MFS generally votes in favor of management proposals that it believes are in
the best long-term economic interests of its clients, MFS may oppose such a
measure if, for example, the intent or effect would be to create additional
inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers.


         ISSUANCE OF STOCK

         There are many legitimate reasons for issuance of stock. Nevertheless,
as noted above under "Non-Salary Compensation Programs", when a stock option
plan (either individually or when aggregated with other plans of the same
company) would substantially dilute the existing equity (e.g., by approximately
15% or more), MFS generally votes against the plan. In addition, MFS votes
against proposals where management is asking for authorization to issue common
or preferred stock with no reason stated (a "blank check") because the
unexplained authorization could work as a potential anti-takeover device.

         REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

         MFS supports proposals to institute share repurchase plans in which
all shareholders have the opportunity to participate on an equal basis. Such
plans may include a company acquiring its own shares on the open market, or a
company making a tender offer to its own shareholders.

         CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

         MFS votes in favor of proposals to ensure that shareholder voting
results are kept confidential. For example, MFS supports proposals that would
prevent management from having access to shareholder voting information that is
compiled by an independent proxy tabulation firm.

         CUMULATIVE VOTING

         MFS opposes proposals that seek to introduce cumulative voting and for
proposals that seek to eliminate cumulative voting. In either case, MFS will
consider whether cumulative voting is likely to enhance the interests of MFS'
clients as minority shareholders. In our view, shareholders should provide
names of qualified candidates to a company's nominating committee, which now
for the first time (for U.S. listed companies) must be comprised solely of
"independent" directors.

         WRITTEN CONSENT AND SPECIAL MEETINGS

         Because the shareholder right to act by written consent (without
calling a formal meeting of shareholders) can be a powerful tool for
shareholders, MFS generally opposes proposals that would prevent shareholders
from taking action without a formal meeting or would take away a shareholder's
right to call a special meeting of company shareholders.

         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

         MFS believes that the appointment of auditors is best left to the
board of directors of the company and therefore supports the ratification of
the board's selection of an auditor for the company. Recently, some shareholder
groups have submitted proposals to limit the non-audit activities of a
company's audit firm. Some proposals would prohibit the provision of any
non-audit services by a company's auditors to that company. MFS opposes
proposals recommending the prohibition or limitation of the performance of
non-audit services by an auditor, and proposals recommending the removal of a
company's auditor due to the performance of non-audit work for the company by
its auditor. MFS believes that the board, or its audit committee, should have
the discretion to hire the company's auditor for specific pieces of non-audit
work in the limited situations permitted under current law.

         BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS

         Best practices standards are rapidly developing in the corporate
governance areas as a result of recent corporate scandals, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and revised listing standards on major stock exchanges. MFS
generally support these developments. However, many issuers are not publicly
registered, are not subject to these enhanced listing standards, or are not
operating in an environment that is comparable to that in the United States. In
reviewing proxy proposals under these circumstances, MFS votes for proposals
that enhance standards of corporate governance so long as we believe that -
given the circumstances or the environment within which the issuers operate -
the proposal is consistent with the best long-term economic interests of our
clients.

         SOCIAL ISSUES

         There are many groups advocating social change, and many have chosen
the publicly-held corporation as a vehicle for advancing their agenda. Common
among these are resolutions requiring the corporation to refrain from investing
or conducting business in certain countries, to adhere to some list of goals or
principles (e.g., environmental standards) or to promulgate special reports on
various activities. MFS votes against such proposals unless their
shareholder-oriented benefits will outweigh any costs or disruptions to the
business, including those that use corporate resources to further a particular
social objective outside the business of the company or when no discernible
shareholder economic advantage is evident.

         The laws of various states may regulate how the interests of certain
clients subject to those laws (e.g., state pension plans) are voted with
respect to social issues. Thus, it may be necessary to cast ballots differently
for certain clients than MFS might normally do for other clients.

         FOREIGN ISSUERS

         MFS will evaluate items on proxies for foreign companies in the
context of the guidelines described above, as well as local market standards
and best practices. Proxies for foreign companies often contain significantly
more voting items than those of U.S. companies. Many of these items on foreign
proxies involve repetitive, non-controversial matters that are mandated by
local law. Accordingly, the items that are generally deemed routine and which
do not require the exercise of judgment under these guidelines (and therefore
voted in favor) for foreign issuers include the following: (i) receiving
financial statements or other reports from the board; (ii) approval of
declarations of dividends; (iii) appointment of shareholders to sign board
meeting minutes; (iv) discharge of management and supervisory boards; (v)
approval of share repurchase programs; (vi) election of directors in
uncontested elections and (vii) appointment of auditors.

         In accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign
companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period
beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the
meeting ("share blocking"). Depending on the country in which a company is
domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the
meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the
company. While practices vary, in many countries the block period can be
continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and
postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability
of a shareholder to have the "block" restriction lifted early (e.g., in some
countries shares generally can be "unblocked" up to two days prior to the
meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be
discretionary with the issuer's transfer agent). Due to these restrictions, MFS
must balance the benefits to its clients of voting proxies against the
potentially serious portfolio management consequences of a reduced flexibility
to sell the underlying shares at the most advantageous time. For companies in
countries with share blocking periods, the disadvantage of being unable to sell
the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages
of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly, MFS will
not vote those proxies in the absence of an unusual, significant vote.

B. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

    1. MFS PROXY REVIEW GROUP

       The administration of these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures is
overseen by the MFS Proxy Voting Committee, which includes senior personnel
from the MFS Legal and Global Investment Support Departments. The MFS Proxy
Voting Committee:

         a. Reviews these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures at least
            annually and recommends any amendments considered to be necessary
            or advisable;

         b. Determines whether any potential material conflicts of interest
            exist with respect to instances in which (i) MFS seeks to override
            these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures and (ii) votes on
            ballot items not clearly governed by these MFS Proxy Voting
            Policies and Procedures; and

         c. Considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time to time.

    2. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         The MFS Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for monitoring potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. Any
significant attempt to influence MFS' voting on a particular proxy matter
should be reported to the MFS Proxy Voting Committee.

         In cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these MFS Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, no material conflict of interest will be deemed
to exist. In cases where (i) MFS is considering overriding these MFS Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, or (ii) matters presented for vote are not
clearly governed by these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures, the MFS
Proxy Voting Committee, or delegees, will follow these procedures:

         a. Compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a list of
            significant current and potential (i) distributors of MFS Fund
            shares, (ii) retirement plans administered by MFS, and (iii) MFS
            institutional clients (the "MFS Significant Client List");

         b. If the name of the issuer does not appear on the MFS Significant
            Client List, then no material conflict of interest will be deemed
            to exist, and the proxy will be voted as otherwise determined by
            the MFS Proxy Voting Committee;

         c. If the name of the issuer appears on the MFS Significant Client
            List, then at least one member of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee
            will carefully evaluate the proposed vote in order to ensure that
            the proxy ultimately is voted in what MFS believes to be the best
            long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not in MFS'
            corporate interests; and

         d. For all potential material conflicts of interest identified under
            clause (c) above, the MFS Proxy Voting Committee will document: the
            name of the issuer, the issuer's relationship to MFS, the analysis
            of the matters submitted for proxy vote, and the basis for the
            determination that the votes ultimately were cast in what MFS
            believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
            clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests. A copy of the
            foregoing documentation will be provided to the MFS' Conflicts
            Officer.

         The members of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee are responsible for
creating and maintaining the MFS Significant Client List, in consultation with
MFS' distribution, retirement plan administration and institutional business
units. The MFS Significant Client List will be reviewed and updated
periodically, as appropriate.

    3. GATHERING PROXIES

         Most proxies received by MFS and its clients originate at Automatic
Data Processing Corp. ("ADP") although a few proxies are transmitted to
investors by corporate issuers through their custodians or depositories. ADP
and issuers send proxies and related material directly to the record holders of
the shares beneficially owned by MFS' clients, usually to the client's
custodian or, less commonly, to the client itself. This material will include
proxy cards, reflecting the proper shareholdings of Funds and of clients on the
record dates for such shareholder meetings, as well as proxy statements with
the issuer's explanation of the items to be voted upon.

         MFS, on behalf of itself and the Funds, has entered into an agreement
with an independent proxy administration firm, Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. (the "Proxy Administrator"), pursuant to which the Proxy
Administrator performs various proxy vote related services, such as vote
processing and recordkeeping functions for MFS' Funds and institutional client
accounts. The Proxy Administrator receives proxy statements and proxy cards
directly or indirectly from various custodians, logs these materials into its
database and matches upcoming meetings with MFS Fund and client portfolio
holdings, which are input into the Proxy Administrator's system by an MFS
holdings datafeed. Through the use of the Proxy Administrator system, ballots
and proxy material summaries for the upcoming shareholders' meetings of over
10,000 corporations are available on-line to certain MFS employees and the MFS
Proxy Voting Committee.

    4. ANALYZING PROXIES

         Proxies are voted in accordance with these MFS Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures. The Proxy Administrator at the prior direction of MFS
automatically votes all proxy matters that do not require the particular
exercise of discretion or judgment with respect to these MFS Proxy Voting
Policies and Procedures as determined by the MFS Proxy Voting Committee. With
respect to proxy matters that require the particular exercise of discretion or
judgment, MFS considers and votes on those proxy matters. Representatives of
the MFS Proxy Voting Committee review, as appropriate, votes cast to ensure
conformity with these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.

         As a general matter, portfolio managers and investment analysts have
little or no involvement in specific votes taken by MFS. This is designed to
promote consistency in the application of MFS' voting guidelines, to promote
consistency in voting on the same or similar issues (for the same or for
multiple issuers) across all client accounts, and to minimize the potential
that proxy solicitors, issuers, or third parties might attempt to exert
inappropriate influence on the vote. In limited types of votes (e.g., corporate
actions, such as mergers and acquisitions), a representative of MFS Proxy
Voting Committee may consult with or seek recommendations from portfolio
managers or analysts.(1) However, the MFS Proxy Voting Committee would
ultimately determine the manner in which all proxies are voted.

- -----------
(1) From time to time, due to travel schedules and other commitments, an
    appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst is not available to
    provide a recommendation on a merger or acquisition proposal. If such a
    recommendation cannot be obtained within a few business days prior to the
    shareholder meeting, the MFS Proxy Review Group may determine to vote the
    proxy in what it believes to be the best long-term economic interests of
    MFS' clients.

         As noted above, MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines when
such an override is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent with the overall
principle of voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
clients. Any such override of the guidelines shall be analyzed, documented and
reported in accordance with the procedures set forth in these policies.

    5. VOTING PROXIES

        In accordance with its contract with MFS, the Proxy Administrator also
generates a variety of reports for the MFS Proxy Voting Committee, and makes
available on-line various other types of information so that the MFS Proxy
Voting Committee may review and monitor the votes cast by the Proxy
Administrator on behalf of MFS' clients.

C. MONITORING SYSTEM

         It is the responsibility of the Proxy Administrator and MFS' Proxy
Voting Committee to monitor the proxy voting process. When proxy materials for
clients are received, they are forwarded to the Proxy Administrator and are
input into the Proxy Administrator's system. Through an interface with the
portfolio holdings database of MFS, the Proxy Administrator matches a list of
all MFS Funds and clients who hold shares of a company's stock and the number
of shares held on the record date with the Proxy Administrator's listing of any
upcoming shareholder's meeting of that company.

         When the Proxy Administrator's system "tickler" shows that the voting
cut-off date of a shareholders' meeting is approaching, a Proxy Administrator
representative checks that the vote for MFS Funds and clients holding that
security has been recorded in the computer system. If a proxy card has not been
received from the client's custodian, the Proxy Administrator calls the
custodian requesting that the materials be forwarded immediately. If it is not
possible to receive the proxy card from the custodian in time to be voted at
the meeting, MFS may instruct the custodian to cast the vote in the manner
specified and to mail the proxy directly to the issuer.

D. RECORDS RETENTION

         MFS will retain copies of these MFS Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures in effect from time to time and will retain all proxy voting reports
submitted to the Board of Trustees, Board of Directors and Board of Managers of
the MFS Funds for the period required by applicable law. Proxy solicitation
materials, including electronic versions of the proxy cards completed by
representatives of the MFS Proxy Voting Committee, together with their
respective notes and comments, are maintained in an electronic format by the
Proxy Administrator and are accessible on-line by the MFS Proxy Voting
Committee. All proxy voting materials and supporting documentation, including
records generated by the Proxy Administrator's system as to proxies processed,
including the dates when proxy ballots were received and submitted, and the
votes on each company's proxy issues, are retained as required by applicable
law.

E. REPORTS

         MFS FUNDS

         MFS will report the results of its voting to the Board of Trustees,
Board of Directors and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds. These reports will
include: (i) a summary of how votes were cast; (ii) a review of situations
where MFS did not vote in accordance with the guidelines and the rationale
therefor; (iii) a review of the procedures used by MFS to identify material
conflicts of interest; and (iv) a review of these policies and the guidelines
and, as necessary or appropriate, any proposed modifications thereto to reflect
new developments in corporate governance and other issues. Based on these
reviews, the Trustees, Directors and Managers of the MFS Funds will consider
possible modifications to these policies to the extent necessary or advisable.

ALL MFS ADVISORY CLIENTS

         At any time, a report can be printed by MFS for each client who has
requested that MFS furnish a record of votes cast. The report specifies the
proxy issues which have been voted for the client during the year and the
position taken with respect to each issue.

         Generally, MFS will not divulge actual voting practices to any party
other than the client or its representatives (unless required by applicable
law) because we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to
the client.

                                                                                   investment management
                                                                                   area of MFS since 1993.
</TABLE>

COMPENSATION. Portfolio manager total cash compensation is a combination of
base salary and performance bonus:

    o Base Salary - Base salary represents a smaller percentage of portfolio
      manager total cash compensation (generally below 33%) than incentive
      compensation.

    o Performance Bonus - Generally, incentive compensation represents a
      majority of portfolio manager total cash compensation. The performance
      bonus is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors,
      with more weight given to the former (generally over 60%) and less weight
      given to the latter.

        >> The quantitative portion is based on pre-tax performance of all of
           the accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the
           Fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a
           one-, three- and five-year period relative to the appropriate Lipper
           peer group universe and/or one or more benchmark indices with
           respect to each account. Primary weight is given to portfolio
           performance over a three-year time period with lesser consideration
           given to portfolio performance over one- and five-year periods
           (adjusted as appropriate if the portfolio manager has served for
           shorter periods).

        >> The qualitative portion is based on the results of an annual
           internal peer review process (conducted by other portfolio managers,
           analysts and traders) and management's assessment of overall
           portfolio manager contributions to investor relations and the
           investment process (distinct from fund and other account
           performance).

Portfolio managers also typically benefit from the opportunity to participate
in the MFS Equity Plan. Equity interests and/or options to acquire equity
interests in MFS or its parent company are awarded by management, on a
discretionary basis, taking into account tenure at MFS, contribution to the
investment process, and other factors.

Finally, portfolio managers are provided with a benefits package including a
defined contribution plan, health coverage and other insurance, which are
available to other employees of MFS on substantially similar terms. The
percentage such benefits represent of any portfolio manager's compensation
depends upon the length of the individual's tenure at MFS and salary level, as
well as other factors.

Advisory fees are not based upon performance of any of the accounts identified
in the table above.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MFS seeks to identify potential conflicts of
interest resulting from a portfolio manager's management of both the Fund and
other accounts, and has adopted policies and procedures designed to address
such potential conflicts.

The management of multiple funds and accounts (including proprietary accounts)
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and accounts have
different objectives and strategies, benchmarks, time horizons and fees as a
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. In certain instances there may be securities which
are suitable for the Fund's portfolio as well as for accounts of MFS or its
subsidiaries with similar investment objectives. A Fund's trade allocation
policies may give rise to conflicts of interest if the Fund's orders do not get
fully executed or are delayed in getting executed due to being aggregated with
those of other accounts of MFS or its subsidiaries. A portfolio manager may
execute transactions for another fund or account that may adversely impact the
value of the Fund's investments. Investments selected for funds or accounts
other than the Fund may outperform investments selected for the Fund.

When two or more clients are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of
the same security, the securities are allocated among clients in a manner
believed by MFS to be fair and equitable to each. It is recognized that in some
cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Fund is concerned. In most cases, however, MFS believes
that the Fund's ability to participate in volume transactions will produce
better executions for the Fund.

MFS does not receive a performance fee for its management of the Fund. As a
result, MFS and/or a portfolio manager may have a financial incentive to
allocate favorable or limited opportunity investments or structure the timing
of investments to favor accounts other than the Fund - for instance, those that
pay a higher advisory fee and/or have a performance fee.

annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs begin on March 1st
of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of shares that
may be purchased in each annual period (March 1 through the following February
28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the first day of the
plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of shares available for purchase for
the March 1, 2006 plan year is 5,191,476.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (as required by Item
22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A), or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the effectiveness registrant's disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment
    Company Act of 1940 (the "Act")) as conducted within 90 days of the filing
    date of this report on Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal financial
    officer and principal executive officer have concluded that those
    disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the
    material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on this
    report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
    forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter covered by the report that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

    (1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit: Code of Ethics attached hereto.
    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2
        under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.
    (3) Any written solicitation to purchase securities under Rule 23c-1 under
        the Act sent or given during the period covered by the report by or on
        behalf of the Registrant to 10 or more persons. Not applicable.

(b) If the report is filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
    provide the certifications required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act (17 CFR
    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title
    18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r),
    or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such certification
    will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under
    the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that
    the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference: Attached hereto.

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the
"Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

         o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
           or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
           relationships;

         o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
           reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
           Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
           communications made by the Funds;

         o compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
           and regulations;

         o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
           appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.      CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer
should not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests
and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Covered Officer must:

         o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
           improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
           for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
           the detriment of the Fund; and

         o not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
           individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
           benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o running for political office;

         o the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
           has current or prospective business dealings unless such
           entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
           as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
           of impropriety;

         o any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
           relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
           banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
           principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
           thereof;

         o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
           charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
           transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
           interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
           ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
           disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
           others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
           or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
           and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
           her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
           employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
           full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
           reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
           in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
           compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
           standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
           regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
           becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
           or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
           with the requirements of the Code;

         o annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
           or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
           Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
           Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
           employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
           potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
           Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.


The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or
other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this
Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
